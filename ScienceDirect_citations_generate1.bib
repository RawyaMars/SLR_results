	abstract = {The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.},

	abstract = {As data becomes the new fuel of the economy and a key asset to address our societal challenges, we cannot afford to have the data of businesses, public sector and individuals stored and kept unexploited or, what is worse, exploited by others that actually have the resources and capacity to do it. This is affecting not only our economic performance but also our security, safety and sovereignty. Among the plethora of data sources that exist nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is recognised as a game-changer technology that expands its applicability to a huge variety of domains. Its main asset is, precisely, the data that the myriad of sensors embedded in the environment are constantly generating. The diffusion of platforms for IoT data sharing and monetisation is one of the key success factors which may help to drive the data economy and industrial transformation. In this paper, we are presenting a data sharing platform based on Blockchain, so-called Blockchain-based IoT Data Marketplace (BIDM) over which data producers and data consumers are able to share data in a decentralised and trustworthy manner. The BIDM enables a data marketplace where owners of IoT infrastructures can expose the observations that their devices generate while retaining control over who accesses each observation and directly getting revenues according to the price they have set. The evaluation that we have carried out of the BIDM’s behaviour and performance in terms of operational execution times and scalability has been the basis for the discussion that we are presenting on the shortcomings that are typically associated with the use of Blockchain technologies as enablers for data marketplaces. This discussion also includes the evaluation of the challenges that must be considered for the creation of secure and interoperable Data Spaces based on Blockchain.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of distributed, multi-perspective conformance checking for Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is addressed. Traditionally, conformance checking has been performed centrally by a trusted entity, however that may not be applicable in the case of collaborative processes between multiple organizations. Consortium Blockchain has been adopted to overcome the need for a trusted entity and foster transparency, accountability, and workflow. Existing blockchain-based conformance checking frameworks focus on translating BPMN models into smart contracts, however they do not support complex BPMN constructs, which limits their applicability in real-life collaborations. In this paper, distributed, multi-perspective conformance checking framework is proposed. This framework supports complex BPMN constructs such as Timers or Boundary processes running on a Consortium blockchain. The proposed framework includes: (1) A process to extract Process Conformance Rules from BPMN models, and (2) A blockchain-based technique to perform checking of the extracted rules to determine process conformance. Furthermore, it can be used by businesses in both after-the-fact checking or during process execution in a transparent and trusted manner. Evaluation of the framework implemented over Quorum conducted with real-life logs proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detecting various violation types in a traceable and transparent manner.},

	abstract = {The emission trading systems (ETSs) have encouraged the more usage of renewable energy, aiming for energy generation. However, the existing ETSs suffer from carbon credit scams, poor monitoring, verification and reporting (MRV), participants’ unwillingness and non-transparent trading. To address these issues, we propose a trustworthy and incentivized emission trading system using hyperledger (a permissioned blockchain) and smart contracts. It assures a transparent trading of carbon credits (CC) with better MRV. It applies three smart contracts viz; CC selling, CC buying and CC trading to achieve reliable and secure transactions of the energy trading with the improved trust. For emission trading, we propose a priority based auction, in which priority to CC sellers is assigned based on their carbon credits, while priority to CC buyers is assigned based on their reputation. This strategy rewards the participants for their efforts towards avoiding the deforestification and the use of renewable energy. In addition, it is incentivized for both CC buyers as well as sellers, and thus, it encourages more number of participants. The proposed system satisfies more than 84.37\% bids with minimum transaction latency (0.41 s) and sufficient throughput (102.42 tps). In addition, multi-criteria analysis using different statistical methods is performed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the proposed systems.},

However, in the construction industry, the absence of a uniform and transparent system for managing quality information undermines the assurance process and may lead to disputes among stakeholders. In addressing this issue, we develop a blockchain-based framework for managing quality information, referred to as “Product Organization Process (POP) qualityChain”. A Hyperledger-Fabric-based architecture and a series of blockchain solutions (e.g., a POP-model-based quality information structure, a consensus mechanism, smart contracts for processing quality information, authorization sequences, and execution processes) are covered. Finally, we build a prototype system and use a case study to validate our framework. Results show that the proposed framework can decentralize the management of quality information, thereby achieving consistent and secure quality information management.

Two auction price systems and several settlement mechanisms are formulated and compared to assess local trading profit and local market efficiency. We also implement a SC-based mechanism that embeds the auction results and rules to increase trust in the bidding and settlement processes. Our simulations use actual consumption and generation data from 11 houses with smart appliances and self-generation capabilities. We show that auctions, if used consistently, can help the development of a local trade by encouraging people to buy from their neighbors and invest in more generating facilities, knowing that there is a local market on which to rely. Compared to the hybrid - Pay-as-Bid (PaB) in the 1st round plus Uniform Price (UP) in the 2nd round - approach, the pure 2-round UP auction was shown to decrease trading with the retailer by 7.5\%. The market indicators are quite similar for the two pricing methods, whereas the proposed settlement mechanism reduces the buyers' payments by 7\% and increases sellers' encashments by around 8\%.},

	abstract = {Today massive amounts of data are generated from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors that can be streamed in real-time and utilized for building valuable services. As the demand for data sharing has increased, a new business model of data marketplace has emerged that allows individuals to sell their data to buyers for monetary gain. However, these data marketplaces are prone to various threats such as unauthorized data redistribution/reselling, tampering of data, dishonest data ownership claims, and trade of bogus data. The existing solutions related to data ownership traceability are unable to address the above issues due to ambiguous data ownership, undisclosed data reselling, and dispersal of data ownership across multiple marketplaces. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain framework, TrailChain, that uses watermarking to generate a trusted trade trail for tracking the data ownership spanning across multiple decentralized marketplaces. Our solution includes mechanisms for detecting any unauthorized data reselling within and across marketplaces. We also propose a fair resell payment sharing scheme that ensures the resell revenue is shared with the data owners over authorized reselling. We present a prototype implementation of the system using Ethereum. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate TrailChain’s feasibility by benchmarking performance metrics including execution gas costs, execution time, latency and throughput.},

Blockchain Technology (BT) has been put forward as a solution that should bring visibility to the food supply chain. BT is proposed to guarantee the veracity of the product’s information at the different stages of its production. Despite BT’s extraordinary interest in operations and supply chain management, no research supports how its use will generate visibility and avoid fraud in the olive oil quality. We present here how BT combined with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart contracts will improve visibility and avoid fraud in the olive oil quality so providing a competitive advantage. A theoretical use case based on real costs of the financial gain from using BT in a typical OOSC is presented.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a materializing technology that has considerable technical, social, and economic importance. The present day predictions for the influence of IoT are highly monumental. This is because data of any form is found to be predominant to the IoT paradigm, therefore serving different applications like smart home, smart city, healthcare, smart grid, smart farms, manufacturing, and so on. Hence, several heterogeneous sensors are said in existence to estimate different types of parameters and found to be useful for different users. In this paper, a secured image sharing method called a Blockchain Chaotic and Paillier Map-based Authentication (BC-PMA) to provide image data integrity and security by deploying a cloud computing environment is proposed. The BC-PMA method is split into three sections. First, registration of corresponding classes of images in the cloud server via blockchain is presented by employing the Cat Map Registration model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing Paillier Map-based Authentication where validation is ensured via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, unique and separate classes of images are provided with the respective, therefore ensuring secured classes of image sharing between users in the cloud environment. The results have been analyzed against traditional blockchain-based methods and validated with enhanced simulated results, that good authentication accuracy, minimizing the false positive rate, block generation time, and size considerably. Experimental Result shows that the Authentication Accuracy of the proposed BC-PMA method is improved by 23\%, and minimizes the False Positive Rate and Computational Cost by 32\% and 22\% when compared to the Existing Method.},

To promote the coordinated development of EVs and photovoltaics (PV) under the background of open power selling, a PV–EV bidding model that considers carbon emissions based on the distributed storage and smart contract technology of a blockchain is proposed in this study. This model aims to provide economic benefits to market players, ensure the safety and environmental protection of power grid operations, and integrate the ladder-type carbon emission trading mechanism. Then, it divides the electricity market into the electricity sales layer, i.e., active distribution networks (ADNs) and PV systems, and the electricity purchase layer, i.e., EVs. Smart contracts are signed with the agent layer, i.e., charging stations. The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the price and power of PV systems and EVs in the optimal contract, and the revenue of PV systems and EVs can be increased by over 35\%. Moreover, the orderly charging and discharging of EVs is coordinated with the characteristics of the daily power generation and evening load peaks of PV systems. The proposed model can effectively provide an optimal scheduling scheme for peak load shifting and valley filling while reducing the carbon emissions of ADNs. It also promotes the local consumption of PV.},

	abstract = {With the concerns of environment protection, electric vehicle (EV) is regarded as a promising transportation tool for green cities project. Since the amount of EV is rising shapely, the EV charging demands is also rapidly generated. However, seeking suitable charging facilities is not easy for EV users, new energy companies run charging station separately for self-interests, and charging pile information is not transparent for drivers. This dilemma is not solved until the merging of blockchain technology. In this paper, a novel EV charging system is proposed for the cooperation of new energy companies and providing convenient charging services for users. In this system, charging information is managed and recorded by the company alliance based on consortium blockchain, which is tamper-resistant and multi-centralized. Meanwhile, a new smart contract is designed to balance the allocation of company’ charging users, so that the profits of different new energy companies could be fairer. To equilibrate the interest of companies and EV users, a Bio-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming model (BOMILP) is proposed as the mathematical logic of smart contracts. Furthermore, we proposed a new algorithm named Limited Neighborhood Search with Memory (LNSM) to support the implementation of smart contracts, which could make the smart contract running faster and has a better performance. At last, the proposed EV charging system and the smart contract are validated through a real case study with the EV charging data in Beijing, China.},

Such data sets should arguably ensure end-to-end traceability and data integrity in order to release a medicine batch, which is uniquely identified and tracked by its batch number/code. Consequently, auditable computerised systems are crucial on pharmaceutical production lines, since the industry is becoming increasingly regulated for product quality and patient health purposes. This paper describes the EU-funded SPuMoNI project, which aims to ensure the quality of large amounts of data produced by computerised production systems in representative pharmaceutical environments. Our initial results include significant progress in: (i) end-to-end verification taking advantage of blockchain properties and smart contracts to ensure data authenticity, transparency, and immutability; (ii) data quality assessment models to identify data behavioural patterns that can violate industry practices and/or international regulations; and (iii) intelligent agents to collect and manipulate data as well as perform smart decisions. By analysing multiple sensors in medicine production lines, manufacturing work centres, and quality control laboratories, our approach has been initially evaluated using representative industry-grade pharmaceutical manufacturing data sets generated at an IT environment with regulated processes inspected by regulatory and government agencies.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle.},

According to the recent version of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users have the right to fully control their personal data. Many web service providers also provide some options for users to control the data. However, it is still a challenge to investigate how they enforce these actions. There is a need to deploy additional measures to secure the data access. Focused on this challenge, in this work, we design a scheme that uses smart contract and blockchain to provide a secure data sharing and access environment. In our scheme, there are three major parties and each of them has its own key pair for encrypting and signing the data. We also develop four main smart contracts for different parties, and discuss what kinds of data should be immutable and placed on-chain. In the evaluation, we explore the performance of our scheme under different platforms such as Ethereum with EtHash, Ethereum with Clique, and Hyperledger. With the analysis of several potential attacks, our results indicate the viability and effectiveness of our scheme.},

	abstract = {With the commercialization of fifth generation mobile networks (5G) and continuous innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing, as a new emerging IoT application, has further deepened our knowledge, utilizing various smart objects distributed throughout the whole industrial system for data collection and processing. To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based crowdsensing model named CrowdLBM with a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed CrowdLBM outperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.},

	abstract = {Context: A large number of Ethereum smart contracts have been deployed on blockchain to manage assets. Unfortunately, due to the immutable nature of blockchain, smart contracts cannot be modified after deployment, even if vulnerabilities have been exposed to attackers. Therefore, it is critical to efficiently and thoroughly test smart contracts. Greybox fuzzing is a prosperous technique for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. However, most existing fuzzers have a common drawback in that they cannot efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. Objective: The goal of this paper is to solve the problem of how to efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. After solving this problem, fuzz testing can execute more code, and there is a higher probability of executing vulnerabilities. Method: We propose an approach for addressing this problem. Specifically, we design an input parameter analysis strategy to selectively mutate a subset of input parameters to reduce invalid mutations. Also, to accelerate the processing of satisfying branch constraints, we design an accelerated multi-objective search strategy to reduce the waste of resources. Result: We implemented this approach in a tool called Effuzz and applied it to real-world smart contracts. Experiments show that Effuzz finds more vulnerabilities and is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art fuzzers. Conclusion: In this paper, we present an approach to efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. Our approach addresses two main problems, i.e., how to select the subset of input parameters for mutation with considering the characteristic of Ethereum smart contracts, and how to accelerate the search to satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints without generating excessive ineffective test cases that waste resources. The experimental results show that our approach is effective.},

Significant amount of research has been conducted on the aspect of networking for using drones as base stations to provide different services. In this work, we deviate from the traditional use of drones to provide connectivity and explore the delivery of products through drones in the context of maintaining social distancing. However, drone delivery process for critical applications such as delivering medical supplies is vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation attacks. The security of drone operation is important to save the users from any breaches that can lead to financial and physical losses. To cope with these security issues and to make the delivery process transparent, we propose a blockchain-based drone delivery system that registers and authenticates the participating entities including products (medical supplies), warehouse (medical centers) and drones. To this end, we utilize Ethereum platform for implementation of blockchain and smart contract and we present an analysis of different factors that influence the authentication process in terms of time and the number of transactions. Furthermore, to make the communication of a drone with command and control center more secure and robust, we use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system.},

Blockchain technology plays a vital role in various applications like artificial intelligence, supply chain, cloud computing, the healthcare sector, and many more.

	abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems are an emerging technology that facilitates real-time vehicle-to-everything communication. Hence, securing and authenticating data packets for intra- and inter-vehicle communication are fundamental security services in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, public-key cryptography (PKC) is commonly used in signature-based authentication, which consumes significant computation resources and communication bandwidth for signatures generation and verification, and key distribution. Therefore, physical layer-based secret key extraction has emerged as an effective candidate for key agreement, exploiting the randomness and reciprocity features of wireless channels. However, the imperfect channel reciprocity generates discrepancies in the extracted key, and existing reconciliation algorithms suffer from significant communication costs and security issues. In this paper, PKC-based authentication is used for initial legitimacy detection and exchanging authenticated probing packets. Accordingly, we propose a blockchain-based reconciliation technique that allows the trusted third party (TTP) to publish the correction sequence of the mismatched bits through a transaction using a smart contract. The smart contract functions enable the TTP to map the transaction address to vehicle-related information and allow vehicles to obtain the transaction contents securely. The obtained shared key is then used for symmetric key cryptography (SKC)-based authentication for subsequent transmissions, saving significant computation and communication costs. The correctness and security robustness of the scheme are proved using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN)-logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulator. We also discussed the scheme’s resistance to typical attacks. The scheme’s performance in terms of packet delay and loss ratio is evaluated using the network simulator (OMNeT++). Finally, the computation analysis shows that the scheme saves ∼99\% of the time required to verify 1000 messages compared to existing PKC-based schemes.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant interest in various areas beyond the financial sector, with profound applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), providing the means for creating truly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking into account the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is critical that a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable of addressing the many challenges IoT is facing, but also does not introduce other defects, e.g. in terms of performance, making its adoption hard to achieve. This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and coherent review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their ability to meet the requirements and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural aspects of blockchain solutions, like the platforms’ software and network setups, the consensus protocols used, as well as smart contracts, are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0 and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols’ performance and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements of our reference IoT domain.},

	abstract = {Globalisation, shorter product life cycles, and increasing product varieties have led to complex supply chains. At the same time, there is a growing interest of customers and governments in having a greater transparency of brands, manufacturers, and producers throughout the supply chain. Due to the complex structure of collaborative manufacturing networks, the increase of supply chain transparency is a challenge for manufacturing companies. The blockchain technology offers an innovative solution to increase the transparency, security, authenticity, and auditability of products. However, there are still uncertainties when applying the blockchain technology to manufacturing scenarios and thus enable all stakeholders to trace back each component of an assembled product. This paper proposes a framework design to increase the transparency and auditability of products in collaborative manufacturing networks by adopting the blockchain technology. In this context, each component of a product is marked with a unique identification number generated by blockchain-based smart contracts. In this way, a transparent auditability of assembled products and their components can be achieved for all stakeholders, including the customer.},

	abstract = {Regulatory changes in different countries regarding self-consumption and growing public concern about the environment are encouraging the establishment of community microgrids. These community microgrids integrate a large number of small-scale distributed energy resources and offers a solution to enhance power system reliability and resilience. This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles, mimicking the most typical layout of cities. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid, without requiring interaction with the distributed system operator. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal.},

	abstract = {With the prevalence of blockchain technology, Ethereum, as the second-largest blockchain, with the capabilities of running smart contracts, grows fast. A user on the Ethereum platform can implement smart contracts as well as remit its cryptocurrency. Cyber-attacks often target cryptocurrency. Besides, Ethereum may be exploited by malicious users for launching attacks. Therefore, the demand for Ethereum network supervision is increasing. To protect interior users on Ethereum from attacks, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should supervise the Ethereum traffic from or to its internal users. Ethereum traffic identification is the first step towards supervision. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer communication network implemented by DEVp2p. DEVp2p is designed to realize data interaction and adopts encryption to enhance anonymity on Ethereum. It is difficult to identify Ethereum traffic accurately at line speed in a high-speed network. So far, Ethereum traffic identification has not been explored yet. This paper designs an efficient Ethereum traffic identification system with high identification accuracy, dubbed ETI (Ethereum Traffic Identification), for an ISP to supervise its internal users on Ethereum without Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). ETI first constructs an active node library consisting of core nodes on Ethereum and active Ethereum peers in the ISP. Then potential Ethereum flows are filtered by checking if their sources or destinations are in the active node library. As active Ethereum nodes may generate non-Ethereum traffic, machine learning classifiers are further adopted to judge if the potential Ethereum traffic is actually from Ethereum. The classification is based on the unique packet/payload-length and port number-related traffic features on Ethereum implemented by DEVp2p. Our experimental studies validate that ETI outperforms state-of-the-art network traffic classification methods in identification accuracy and time efficiency. ETI achieves an identification accuracy of 0.9998 and relatively high time efficiency.},

It has wide spectrum of applications ranging from finance to social services and has greatly influenced the emerging business world. Since, blockchain technology is getting embedded in the e-commerce services, the cryptocurrencies are gaining huge prevalence. Bitcoin and ethereum are few such crypto currencies, which have utilized decentralized nature of blockchain. Blockchain can be considered as a distributed database system containing immutable ledgers, which are prone to attack by malicious users. Although, from the initial digital currency to the present smart contract, the utilities of blockchain have been harnessed, the innovative technology has to rely on cryptography for its security. There are several reports, which emphases on the vulnerabilities and security of blockchain, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive and methodical survey in both application and technical views. In this survey article, the authors cover various aspects related to blockchain including its taxonomies and the situations in which a particular category of blockchain should be applied. The authors also focusses on the structure of blockchain and the working of the ongoing transactions in the cryptocurrency network. In addition, the authors also specify various categories of consensus protocols, smart contracts, forks, techniques for generating the consensus. A detailed taxonomy of blockchain along with their features and related real-world applications is also discussed. In addition, existing key platforms of blockchain related to the cryptocurrencies, hyperledger and multichain are also discussed. Existing emerging vulnerabilities of blockchain related to the recent attacks on bitcoin and etherum is also presented along with the defensive methodologies and future trends in blockchain.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-peer trading of utilities (heating, cooling and electric power) in an eco-industrial park (EIP) is key to realize significant economic and environmental benefits by exploiting synergistic co-generation and surplus trading. A crucial aspect of this symbiotic scheme is that each selfish company (prosumer) will participate in exchanging utilities to increase its own profits depending on its internal load. In this paper, an automated negotiation approach based on utility tokens is proposed to incentivize participation in a market of prosumer peers for trading surpluses in an EIP. During each negotiation episode, a pair of prosumers engage in a bilateral negotiation and resort to a learned policy to bid, concede and accept/reject using both private information and environmental variables. Contract negotiation revolves around agreeing (or not) on the price expressed in tokens of a utility profile. The time-varying value of the utility token accounts for contextual variables beyond the control of each prosumer. Simulation results demonstrate that reinforcement learning allows finding Nash equilibrium policies for smart contract negotiation in a blockchain environment.},

	abstract = {Regular up-gradation in the standards of the wireless networks and to sustain in the market with the best services, are the key challenges to the services providers of the telecommunication industries. Traditional mobile number portability system (TMNPS) is based on the manual process, in which existing service provider and the new service provider have to undergo certain transfers once a porting request is generated by the user. Slow processing of request, lack of transparency among the entities involved, and delay during the verification are the major challenges in the TMNPS. Moreover, a third-party is required to ensure the security of the stored and regulated data. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based mobile number portability scheme, which uses an Ethereum blockchain technology and call routing mechanism to handle the request of the user. The secured royalty contract transactions and secure call routing mechanism are the potential part of the proposed scheme. We then evaluated the performance of the proposed scheme and functionalities of the proposed smart contracts (SCs) using experimental setup with respect to various parameters. Results show that the transition time taken by the proposed scheme is only 4 seconds for 200 blocks and TMNPS took 6 seconds to execute the 200 blocks.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology brings innovation to various industries. Ethereum is currently the second blockchain platform by market capitalization, it’s also the largest smart contract blockchain platform. Smart contracts can simplify and accelerate the development of various applications, but they also bring some problems. For example, smart contracts are used to commit fraud, vulnerability contracts are deliberately developed to undermine fairness, and there are numerous duplicative contracts that waste performance with no actual purpose. In this paper, we propose a transaction-based classification and detection approach for Ethereum smart contract to address these issues. We collected over 10,000 smart contracts from Ethereum and focused on the data behavior generated by smart contracts and users. We identified four behavior patterns from the transactions by manual analysis, which can be used to distinguish the difference between different types of contracts. Then 14 basic features of a smart contract are constructed from these. To construct the experimental dataset, we propose a data slicing algorithm for slicing the collected smart contracts. After that, we use an LSTM network to train and test our datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our approach can distinguish different types of contracts and can be applied to anomaly detection and malicious contract identification with satisfactory precision, recall, and f1-score.},

	abstract = {Vehicular network applications, such as Local Danger Warnings (LDW), have become necessary as they provide services to drivers with warnings and instructions to ensure safe driving. However, before any vehicle reacts to an alert, it is essential to verify its veracity because an incorrect warning misleads other vehicles and causes unnecessary delays and detours in traffic. On the other hand, ignoring an alert or taking too long to verify it can cause accidents. A common way to address this problem is via a reputation system, where the veracity and plausibility of an alert message are assessed based on the reputation of the vehicle that discloses it. This paper describes a decentralized reputation system based on a consortium blockchain and smart contracts called BRS4VANETs. This system analyzes the reliability of data generated by a vehicle, detects malicious behavior, and contributes to decision-making. The complete functional architecture of the system, detailing the algorithms, evaluation metrics, communication protocol, and message formats, is described and implemented. Experiments with network and traffic simulators evaluated the risk of a false message attack, the effectiveness of the system and its overheads. The assessment demonstrates the importance of reputation systems and also shows the feasibility of having a decentralized system to store and disseminate reputation information based on blockchain technologies. Finally, the results also demonstrate that BRS4VANETs can successfully detect suspicious and malicious vehicles.},

	abstract = {Blockchain as a distributed computing platform enables users to deploy pieces of software (known as smart contracts) for a wealth of next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party. The advantages of smart contracts do, however, come at a price. As with most technologies, there are potential security threats, vulnerabilities and various other issues associated with smart contracts. Writing secure and safe smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to various business logics, as well as platform vulnerabilities and limitations. Formal methods have recently been advocated to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between 2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs) for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth research. Our study also provides possible future research directions.},

	abstract = {This paper designs a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy-backed token market for prosumers under blockchain technology. The prosumers in the presented market are classified into buyers and sellers based on their net generation. Another set of prosumers is electric vehicle (EV) owners that participate in the proposed energy token market via the storage capacity of their EVs. Using smart contracts, all market players can engage in bilateral (P2P) transactions of energy-backed tokens with other prosumers at the agreed price and with their existing market via real-time pricing. Furthermore, the buyers can participate in DR programs as virtual generators without the interference of a third party and shift their load based on their preferences to the hours with an abundant local generation or low market price. To avoid inflation and “false welfare” in the energy-backed token market, this paper applies a demurrage mechanism to lower the redemption value of energy tokens. With this mechanism in place, the buyers and sellers try to minimize the time interval between token purchase and consumption and between token generation and selling. A decentralized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme is developed to clear the proposed fully-decentralized energy-backed token market in the presence of EVs and the demurrage mechanism. This approach protects the players’ privacy while ensuring solution feasibility. The simulation results suggest that the presence of EVs enhances the freedom of the prosumers in choosing their energy peers and increases their total welfare by 20 percent.},

	abstract = {An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.},

To tackle these challenges, we present a cost-efficient and blockchain-based secure framework for building a community of farmers and crowdsourcing the data generated by them to help the farmers’ community. Apart from ensuring privacy and security of data, a revenue model is also incorporated to provide incentives to farmers. These incentives would act as a motivating factor for the farmers to willingly participate in the process.

In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures.

This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.},

This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg game and Blockchain-based framework that enables consumer-centric decarbonization by automating iterative negotiations between policy makers and consumers or generators to reduce carbon emissions. This iterative negotiation is modeled as a Stackelberg game-theoretic problem, and securely facilitated by Blockchain technologies. The policy maker formulates carbon prices and monetary compensation rates to dynamically incentivize the carbon reduction, whereas consumers and generators schedule their power profiles to minimize bills and maximize profits of generation, respectively. The negotiating agreement is yielded by reaching a Stackelberg equilibrium. The exchanged information and controlling functions are realized by using smart contracts of Blockchain technologies. Case studies of GB power systems show that the proposed framework can incentivize 9\% more bill savings for consumers and 45.13\% more energy generation from renewable energy sources. As a consumer-centric decarbonization framework, it can at least reduce carbon emissions by 40\%.},

Cloud storage audit schemes can help data owner (DO) to confirm the integrity of their data, but the existing schemes still have some limitations. On one hand, the existing schemes assume that DO's terminal devices are computationally powerful enough to handle various operations in a timely manner. While in practice, the terminal devices probably are mobile phones, tablets and other devices with low computing power. On the other hand, the existing schemes rely on a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA), but it is not in line with real application scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit (BBPO-PA) scheme for low performance terminal devices. Firstly, we introduced a trusted proxy authorized by DO, which can process and upload DO's encrypted files. Secondly, we applied blockchain in our scheme and utilized smart contracts instead of untrusted TPA to improve the reliability and stability of audit results. Thirdly, we took advantage of an index table to ensure that our scheme can support dynamic data operation. Finally, security analysis revealed that our scheme is provably secure in random oracle model. Meanwhile, performance analysis demonstrated that our scheme is efficient and especially suitable for low performance terminal devices.},

	abstract = {With product customization an emerging business opportunity, organizations must find ways to collaborate and enable sharing of information in an inherently trust-less network. In this paper, we propose – “FabRec”: a decentralized approach to handle manufacturing information generated by various organizations using blockchain technology. We propose a system in which a decentralized network of manufacturing machines and computing nodes can enable automated transparency of an organization’s capability, third party verification of such capability through a trail of past historic events and automated mechanisms to drive paperless contracts between participants using ‘smart contracts’. Our system decentralizes critical information about the manufacturer and makes it available on a peer-to-peer network composed of fiduciary nodes to ensure transparency and data provenance through a verifiable audit trail. We present a testbed platform through a combination of manufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to demonstrate mechanisms through which a consortium of disparate organizations can communicate through a decentralized network. Our prototype testbed demonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized network for verification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be autonomously initiated in the physical world. This paper intends to expose system elements in preparation for much larger field tests through the working prototype and discusses the future potential of blockchain for manufacturing IT.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46\% uniqueness and 2.38\% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain holds promise to impact a wide range of application areas, but it still suffers from technical challenges such as security and scalability. The increase in the number of transactions puts blockchains under data storage pressure. The emergence of cross-chain technologies connects different blockchains and relieves the data storage pressure. However, the existing research generally focuses on the technical realization of cross chain, lacking in-depth research on consistency issues like data integrity verification of cross-chain interaction. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cross-chain data integrity verification scheme (DCIV) from the point of view of governing the chain by chain. We adopt supervision chain to audit the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction. We preprocess the off-chain original data in the form of Merkle tree. Before cross-chain interaction, we process the data with KZG polynomial commitment. During the auditing period, the supervision chain generates a challenge and verifies the integrity of cross-chain data. In particular, we add audit digests into the structure of transactions in blockchain to reduce the storage burden during auditing. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that DCIV can verify the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction, achieving secure and accurate cross-chain data sharing.},

The research indicators proved that the interest in MGs is growing in numerous countries whose concern is to seek alternative energy generation with renewable energy sources (RES) to supply an increasing demand for energy production and reduce the impacts of atmospheric pollutants. Moreover, the insertion of blockchain technology in the energy market can provide significant advances in the commercialization of electric energy, enabling virtual transactions to be conducted in a decentralized and secure way, managing numerous smart contracts, and contributing reasonably to introducing prosumers in energy transactions in MGs. This systematic review enabled us to shed more light and direct the study methodology to answer the questions surrounding this research. The aspects found explore concepts similar to the characteristics of TE and MGs exposed in the review of indicators. It was possible to perceive that the research strategy was successfully employed and has considerable academic significance, especially in this theme. Additionally, a new approach to the topic was presented by analyzing the interactions of prosumers and utility. The sustainable aspect related to MGs communities is highlighted because of the self-supply of smart homes and the use of RES.},

	abstract = {A key component of blockchain technology is the ledger, viz., a database that, unlike standard databases, keeps in memory the complete history of past transactions as in a notarial archive for the benefit of any future test. In second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum, the ledger is coupled with smart contracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with agreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The coupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background for very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only focus of first generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin. However, the currently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming constructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited maliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We propose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by formalizing a notion of contract modeled as a finite-state automaton with well-defined computational characteristics derived from encoding in terms of allocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on programming. To complete the work, we use temporal logic as the basis for an abstract query language that is effectively suited to the historical nature of the information kept in the ledger.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are witnessing increased utilization throughout the world as an alternative to fossil–fueled vehicles. The extensive deployment of EVs can bring challenges to the grid if not properly integrated. Such challenges, however, could be exploited as opportunities if the huge unused capacity of the battery storage in millions of EVs are utilized for ancillary services to the grid and peer–to–peer (PtP) energy trade. Given that there is at least one human user per vehicle, human input must be considered to improve the scheduling process. To that end, this paper presents a new algorithm for bidirectional smart charging of EVs considering user preferences, PtP energy trade, and provision of ancillary services to the grid. The preferences of an EV user as input to the model are embedded into the scheduling process enabling the model to be adaptive to various conditions. Optimization slack variables are utilized for optimal management of EV battery SOC and energy allocation for multiple services. New indices are developed and introduced for quantification of the EV participation in ancillary services and PtP transactions. Real–world data has been collected and utilized for model specification and simulation to make the assumptions more realistic. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are validated using numerical studies. The results indicate that incorporating users’ preferences into the scheduling process would improve the aggregated revenue generated by the EV scheduling model which in turn could offset the charging costs by up to 100\%. Further, an increase of about 90\% in peer-to-peer energy transactions among EVs and 11\% in ancillary services provision to the grid are achieved through the developed user-centric smart charging model.},

	abstract = {Interim payment provisions in construction projects are susceptible to unfair practices. In construction project participants with varying financial capacities belonging to different organizations are bound by contractual relationships. Due to this type of project organizational structure, project participants do not completely trust each other which prevents the adoption of existing centralized automated frameworks for interim payment. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed blockchain-based framework that does not require to be trusted for automatically enforcing the terms and conditions related to interim payments and sharing payment records at project-level transparently and securely. A logic to automatically initiate, validate, and disburse interim payments according to general contract conditions for interim payments is formalized in this paper. A blockchain-based data model that enables selective-transparency in payment records is proposed. This data model facilitates the sharing of sensitive financial information privately between two contracting parties and non-sensitive payment-related information publicly among all project participants. The proposed blockchain-based framework is supported by a key management strategy to facilitate different security properties such as confidentiality and authenticity of data and users. Considering the non-technical nature of construction project participants, the proposed key management strategy is designed to dynamically generate cryptographic keys from publicly sharable parameters so that storage and management overheads are reduced. Security properties such as immutability, data confidentiality, user integrity, performance, and cost of deployment of the proposed blockchain framework are validated and recommendations for executing the proposed framework with a high level of security are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {With the development of 5G(5th generation mobile networks) technology, smart cities are an inevitable trend in modern city development. Among them, smart city services are the foundation of 5G-enabled smart cities. As an emerging and informational city service model, crowdsourcing has been widely used in our daily life. However, in the existing crowdsourcing systems, the requesters and the workers are usually required to use the crowdsourcing platform as the trust center, and the payment depends on the third-party central payment institutions, which have a massive security risk. Once these centers are attacked or do evil, it will bring higher losses to the crowdsourcing parties. These problems will negatively affect the further development of 5G-enabled smart cities. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-empowered and decentralized trusted service mechanism for the crowdsourcing system in 5G-enabled smart cities. In the proposed mechanism, the crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages: initialization, task submission, task publication, task reception, scheme submission, scheme arbitration, payment, task rollback, and service compensation. The smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage, and the payment is completed by blockchain without the involvement of third-party central institutions. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum and compare it with the existing crowdsourcing system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and applicability of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.},

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers.

	abstract = {E-commerce retail sales have seen significant growth in the past decade with its proliferation into the consumer markets at unprecedented rates. This has led to the rise of logistics companies (LC) and the advent of Logistics financing as a tool used by them to attain business expansion. The current climate in e-commerce that is characterized by an upswing in sales requires the LCs to equip themselves with sufficient capital to elevate or modernize their operational capabilities. But, these small and medium-sized enterprises tend to overlook their business expansion opportunities due to the unfavorable financing environment created due to their: (i) limited tangible assets (ii) lack of clarity on operating capability, and (iii) lack of reliable information-sharing mechanism. To address these problems, this study aims to utilize the digital assets of the LC to aid logistics financing. This study introduces a logistics financing platform (Log-Flock), that leverages the abilities of the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical system (CPS), and blockchain technologies to support the utilization of digital assets of the LC for logistics financing. The IoT and CPS are combined to support the generation of the digital assets whereas the core constructs of blockchain technology, such as the tokens and smart contracts, are used to (i) introduce incentivized rewarding mechanisms to motivate the engagement of users and, (ii) to perform the digital asset valuation and risk assessment in logistics financing. Some of the expected benefits from the study include: (i) This novel platform if implemented, would significantly reduce the time for financing. (ii) It communicates the operating capability of the LCs in the form of credit rating which is easily comprehensible for the financing institutions.},

Recently, fake charity fundraisers schemes have raised a social concern, and thus a trusted and auditable approach is necessary to manage charity organizations reputations. Blockchain-based charity (BBC) schemes are proposed with decentralization that ensure trust, transparency, and chronology among donators and beneficiaries. However, the schemes suffer from the high-end complexity of certificate generation. Motivated from this, in this paper, we propose a BBC scheme, UpHaaR, where donators, defined as charity persons (CP), and beneficiaries, defined as charity beneficiaries (CB), register in blockchain, managed for diverse fundraisers by charity organizations (CO). The scheme mitigates fake fundraisers, as the charity scheme data and fund allocations to CP are managed as ledger entries in the blockchain. To maintain the security and privacy of massive CP and CB users, the scheme proposes partial key generations through certificate-less cryptography (CLC), which mitigates expensive digital signing and eliminates certificate generation through key distribution centers. For signature aspects, the scheme proposes a lightweight certificate-less signcryption scheme (CSS) that eliminates collusion against insider attacks and reduces computational costs. The scheme is evaluated for security analysis using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and informal attack analysis, and cost evaluations. The proposed results indicate the scheme’s viability against similar conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {India's grape farms face many climate risk events during cultivation and sustainability-related challenges during the export once the crop is harvested. So, to support the farmers, the Government of India (GoI) started promoting adaptive capacity resilient infrastructure. To further strengthen GoI initiatives, this paper proposes a novel Grapevoltaics farm inspired by Dynamic Agrivoltaics (DAgVs) concept based on the shared circular business model principles where resources like energy, water, and land are shared. The conceptual modeling and the rationale revealed that DAgVs' role in protecting the grape farms from natural disasters is prominent and tri-production of electricity, grapes, and water (from rainwater harvesting) is possible. However, the DAgVs effectiveness may be influenced by decisions taken by involved stakeholders (grape farmers and solar plant operators) related to resource sharing and support extension in the time of climate risk events raising questions about the resilience in the near term and the sustainability in the long term. So, to counter the resilience and sustainability challenges in grape farms, DAgVs are leveraged with blockchain smart contract technology making it blockchain-enabled Grapevoltaics (BCeDGVs); to understand the feasibility, integrated techno-economic and life cycle assessments are performed. As an illustrative case study, 1 ha of the grape farm is modeled, taking 12 grape-growing states in India as the study regions. The results showed that the solar panels provide resilience support based on the rules of engagement written on blockchain smart contracts. The BCeDGVs has 1295.28–2908.08 kWh/kWp/day solar electricity generation potential across India with a lifetime average of 15,380.65 MWh even after considering the national average photovoltaic degradation rate of 1.9\%. The observed grape yields varied between 2 and 31.25 Mt/ha with an average yield of 45 Mt/ha (table grape) and 40 Mt/ha (wine grape). The harvested rainwater across India varied between 1.23 and 7.32 Ml. The economic assessment revealed that grape farmers and solar photovoltaic plant operators across India under BCeDGVs could have revenues ranging between 56.25 and 225 MRs. and 29.48–66.19 MRs., respectively, suggesting to relook into the feed-in tariffs and crop selling prices given the digitalization scope. The environmental sustainability results suggest that 1.984 ha/MW land-use mitigation and 12–100\% reduction in groundwater dependency are possible while maintaining the minimum and maximum national average global warming potentials (GWPs) as 0.074 and 0.088 kg CO2eq./kg grape, respectively. Overall, the integrated assessments indicate that BCeDGVs reduce the agriculturally generated GWPs and other impacts while providing resilience support and opening a new research direction for symbiotic grape farms and energy networks.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the blockchain-assisted frequency regulation mechanism for achieving resiliency and robustness in a renewable-based hybrid power system (HPS) powered by multiple sources, including wind turbine generators (WTG), hydrogen fuel cells (FC) with aqua electrolyzer (AE), diesel engine generators (DEG) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Frequency fluctuations are exacerbated by load uncertainties paired with energy-generating source uncertainties resulting from integrating multiple distributed energy resources (DERs) into the national electric power grid. In the event of energy generation loss, efficient load frequency control (LFC) techniques are considered essential for frequency restoration in DER-integrated HPS. In addition, active power regulation data in LFC need secure data storage mechanisms for ensuring cyber-resilience, a transparent cash payout mechanism for the stakeholders in LFC market operation, and related sustainability services. A novel resilient blockchain framework for realizing LFC is proposed for addressing the power resilience and the false-data injection issue. Moreover, a parameter sensitivity algorithm (PSA) constrained optimization methodology using the genetic algorithm (GA) withstands the energy generation loss and uncertainties. A consensus algorithm-based blockchain methodology acts as an enabler for strategic decision-making and secures the data flow to the market operator. The proposed framework-driven methodology is implemented using a Blockchain network developed in python for securing LFC transactions by developing a case study for HPS. Numerous simulation scenarios demonstrate the proposed methodology's effectiveness in establishing a synergistic operative framework for the resilient and robust operation of the hybrid energy system with multiple sources, even in the event of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new generalized recommender system framework based on Blockchain technology called BC-Rec. Blockchain technology is a decentralized data-sharing ledger across a large network of untrusted entities. The presented idea is motivated by the fact that e-business platforms share common data about users, items, and sellers. In other words, a new user/seller in a particular e-business platform may be a trusted user/seller in other e-business platforms. Also, a new item in a particular marketplace may have a historical record in other marketplaces. The core idea behind BC-Rec is to adopt Blockchain technology to share the data required to generate the recommendation between the e-business platforms. BC-Rec architecture is designed based on a permission-less public Blockchain network, Ethereum Blockchain. The key feature of BC-Rec is the smart contract deployed to determine the agreement between certain entities on the Blockchain. We expect that the proposed framework will help alleviate cold-start, sparsity, and shilling attack problems.},

Even if it is untrusted to a third party, it can guarantee the user’s control over his own data. To reduce the computation cost, decentralized edge nodes jointly maintain the blockchain and assist users with limited resources to complete most of the calculations.

	abstract = {With the advent of advancements in the power sector, various new methods have been devised to meet modern society’s electricity needs. To cope with these large sets of electronic device’s current requirements, better energy distribution is needed. Smart Grid (SG) facilitates energy providers to distribute electricity efficiently to the user according to their particular requirements. Recent advancements enable SG to monitor, analyze, control and coordinate for the demand and supply of electricity efficiency and energy saving. SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid. The system is also automated in a way that electricity is transferred from one resident (or service) to another resident according to their requirements. The exchange of energy is done via a smart contract after checking the needs of each participant. Each participant defines their requirements at the time of the registration and can update these thresholds. The privacy protection scheme has higher security, shown by theoretical security analysis. The main contributions of our work are two-fold; Using smart contracts to automate the bidding process for transactions based upon supply and demand for energy in smart cities. Secondly, at the same time, using hyper ledger fabric and composer to leveraging Blockchain to uphold privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality at the same time giving the users ability to have dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.},

Distortions of demand information due to uncoordinated forecasting are captured by a bullwhip measure that factors both forecast error and variance. Cooperation under the system is shown to help minimize this bullwhip measure, thus generating new outcomes for the participants that allow for a higher reward. Under a fixed payout structure, the system achieves credibility of continued cooperation, thus promoting an optimally coordinated equilibrium between retailer and supplier.

	abstract = {A smart contract is a computer program, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract. About 10\% of the security vulnerabilities in smart contracts are caused by misuse of codes without comments. Therefore, there is a need to design effective automatic code comment generation methods for smart contracts. In this study, we propose an information retrieval-based code comment generation method CCGIR for smart contracts. Since code clones are common in smart contract development, CCGIR finds the most similar code in the code repository and reuses its comment through an information retrieval approach from three aspects: semantic similarity, lexical similarity, and syntactic similarity of smart contract codes. We select a corpus, which contains 57,676 unique pairs of {\textless}method, comment{\textgreater} from 40,932 real-world smart contracts, as our experimental subject. Then we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that CCGIR can outperform nine state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three performance measures. Moreover, we perform a human study to further verify that CCGIR can generate higher quality comments. Finally, we find CCGIR can achieve promising performance on the other two code comment generation tasks (i.e., code comment generation for Java and code comment generation for Python). Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed method, we recommend researchers can use our proposed method as the baseline when evaluating their proposed novel code comment generation methods.},

Aiming at the problem that the leakage of electricity consumption information threatens the privacy security of users and the leakage of electricity trading plan destroys the fairness of the DAM, a privacy protection scheme for electricity transactions in microgrid DAM based on consortium blockchain is proposed. Firstly, the scheme is based on the ElGamal algorithm that generates anonymous identities for users involved in transactions, preventing leakage of electricity consumption information and allowing the real identity of the fraudster to be traced in the event of fraudulent transactions. Secondly, a certificateless signcryption (CLS) algorithm is improved to realize the encryption and authentication of the user's electricity trading plan, which enhances the efficiency of the scheme. Finally, the scheme realizes decentralized trading of users in the microgrid in the DAM through the consortium blockchain and smart contracts, ensuring transaction security and improving transaction efficiency. The scheme is proved to have high security under different types of attacks by stochastic prediction machine model. Moreover, by calculating the computation time for different kinds of operations in the two stages of signcryption and unsigncryption, it is concluded that the computation cost of this scheme is lower than that of other schemes of the same type has higher efficiency.},

However, the current IoT applications face significant challenges in terms of the huge amount of collected data, intensive data exchange, security, privacy, centralized processing, and interoperability.

	abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism.

Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7\% lucid and 72.2\% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3\% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping. Conclusion: iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.},

They suffer significant losses due to the combustion of fossil fuels, the long-distance transmission, and distribution of the power to the network. Recently, prosumers, both consumers and producers, emerge with the increasing affordability to invest in domestic solar systems. Prosumers may trade within their communities to better manage their demand and supply as well as providing social and economic benefits. In this paper, we explore the use of Blockchain technologies and auction mechanisms to facilitate autonomous peer-to-peer energy trading within microgrids. We design two frameworks that utilize the smart contract functionality in Ethereum and employ the continuous double auction and uniform-price double-sided auction mechanisms, respectively. We validate our design by conducting A/B tests to compare the performance of different frameworks on a real-world dataset. The key characteristics of the two frameworks and several cost analyses are presented for comparison. Our results demonstrate that a P2P trading platform that integrates the blockchain technologies and agent-based systems is promising to complement the current centralized energy grid.

	abstract = {Context. As self-executing programs on blockchain platforms, smart contracts can build a trusted environment between multi-parties. However, participants who lack programming knowledge usually have difficulties understanding smart contracts by reading the source code. It brings them difficulties and risks when interacting with decentralized applications. Objective. We aim to translate the smart contract source code into natural language descriptions as fine-grained in-line comments to help people better understand, learn and operate smart contracts. Method. We propose an automated translation approach for smart contracts written in Solidity, termed SolcTrans, based on an Syntax Tree (AST) and formal grammar. We have investigated representative Solidity smart contracts, identified the AST parsing paths and core attributes used for translation, and proposed corresponding translation templates for special statements. Then, we leveraged reinforcement learning to train a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar-based syntax synthesizer used to generate comprehensible English sentences as comments. Result. The experimental results show that SolcTrans outperforms four state-of-the-art neural machine translation models under currently available training data and is less affected by lengths of code snippets and translation outputs. We also conducted a human evaluation among 20 volunteers and asked them to score the generated comments. The results demonstrate that SolcTrans performs well on three metrics: Accuracy, Readability, and Instructiveness. Conclusion. Our approach produces high-quality fine-grained comments for smart contract source code under the small training dataset, which creates a paradigm for future studies.},

Market participants interact with the smart contract sending their asks and offers and the distributed application clears the market based on a uniform-price economic dispatch model. We propose and analyze three different implementation approaches on an Ethereum blockchain network. A model representing a physical demonstration project conducted in Seattle, USA, is utilized to simulate the power grid and to provide real-life scenarios for our analysis. We systematically evaluate our three implementation approaches and elucidate several blockchain issues regarding the decentralization of next-generation energy markets. In particular, we identify that certain computation modules may be installed on smart consuming devices in order to increase efficiency, security and decentralization and reduce the overall blockchain overhead cost.

Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its IoT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute-based signature (ABS) of one IoT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the IoT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.},

There are some problems in distributed energy trading, such as high transaction frequency, small transaction volume, high operation cost, lack of information supervision and so on. The openness, transparency, tamper-proof and automatic execution of smart contracts of blockchain technology are consistent with the transaction demand of distributed energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent transaction model of distributed energy based on blockchain. First, the peer to peer transaction mode and transaction process are analysed. Second, a multi-agent dynamic Stackelberg game is launched. It takes distributed generation owners, energy storage companies and a grid corporation as leaders to conduct power bidding. Third, with consumers as followers, the time of use tariff bidding strategy was solved. The obtained results reveal that distributed energy resources are essential in the energy supply of carbon neutrality, which also determines the complementary relationship between a grid corporation and distributed generation owners. The two agents work together to exert effectiveness for the new power system. There is a large space for energy storage companies to improve, and consumers show a trend of off-peak power consumption.},

	abstract = {Maintenance of generation units is a measure to ensure the reliability of power systems. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based truthful condition-based maintenance of generation units (T-CBMGU) platform is proposed to innovate and upgrade state-of-the-art CBMGU. In addition, two valid inequalities are proposed to accelerate the convergence speed of Benders decomposition in maintenance scheduling process. The proposed valid inequalities are formulated based on technical/physical analysis and greedy-based heuristic initialization. More specifically, for data acquisition and failure rate diagnosis/prognosis processes, T-CBMGU can ensure the immutability of the collected operational data. In this way, the influence of tampered data on the diagnosis/prognosis results in state-of-the-art CBMGU can be reduced. For maintenance scheduling and bidding to change scheduled time slot processes, in state-of-the-art CBMGU, the decision makers, i.e., independent system operators (ISOs), may not be trusted. However, in T-CBMGU, the scheduling and bidding processes are implemented automatically via smart contracts rather than by the ISOs; as such, incentives to manipulate data can be avoided. Finally, regarding performance of maintenance actions, in contrast to state-of-the-art CBMGU, the implementation process can be truthfully recorded by the T-CBMGU platform, which facilitates backtracking of responsibility. Then, the T-CBMGU platform and the valid inequalities are tested for the IEEE 300-bus power system. Furthermore, cases with tampered data and distrust caused by fairness manipulation are simulated to show the importance of using T-CBMGU. Finally, the Benders decomposition algorithm with valid inequalities is compared with other solvers to demonstrate its fast convergence speed.},

	abstract = {Electric demand flexibility in buildings is highly dependent on occupant behavior. Evaluating and incentivizing these behaviors can provide grid-responsive support and encourage demand response (DR) participation. To achieve these goals, we developed an infrastructure for connecting Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to a distributed ledger (blockchain network) for long-term monitoring of energy and environmental performance. This study presents a novel Blockchain + IoT paradigm for the building science research community, applied in a real-world application. This Blockchain + IoT Network (BIN) uses Raspberry Pi minicomputers as platforms for connecting sensors to a blockchain network, to provide and analyze real-time indoor environmental quality (IEQ), energy, and carbon intensity data. As part of the study, we propose various metrics to evaluate the environmental footprints of building users. Novel algorithms for normalizing energy usage and carbon intensity, with consideration of a variety of related environmental factors, are executed as smart contracts on the blockchain network. All measurements and the smart contract transactions are reported and visualized on live dashboards. The use of smart contract allocates tokens based on the reward algorithms to incentivize individuals’ energy conservation, and similarly to DR pricing, can help influence occupant consumption patterns towards carbon reduction goals. We further test the smart contract’s algorithm in relation to real sensor data we have collected in two case studies: single-unit households and carbon intensity in the energy market. The combination of proposed metrics translates measured sensor data into token awards, demonstrates upper and lower limits dictated by the grid generation mix profile, and indicates that there is the potential for load shifting to minimize carbon emissions without considering the scale of consumption.},

	abstract = {The voluminous amount of data generated by individuals’ mobile sensors and wearable devices is considered of a great value for the benefits of patients and clinical research. Recent advances incorporating data mining and cloud computing have leveraged the great potential of these data. However, the introduction of such technologies in the process of mobile crowd sensed data mining and analytics could potentially lead to security and privacy concerns. Individuals and organizations are not able to share and collectively run computations on their private data captured by different sensors to infer any processes of common interest. Although solutions such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) were laid decades ago, they are still perceived for theoretical interest only, so far. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap between privacy-preserving data mining and its practice. To do so, we introduce a blockchain-based privacy-preserving SVM classification (BPPSVC) between mutually distrustful data owners. In BPPSVC, blockchain technology along with smart contracts underlay more realistic assumptions about the adversarial model. Our main focus is on investigating the immutability, security and the bookkeeping properties of the blockchain in preserving the privacy of an SVM classifier over horizontally distributed IoT data. To this end, we first propose the system architecture, adversary model and design goals of BPPSVC, then we describe the design details. Our security analysis indicates that the proposed system is secure and it provides fairness and protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. We finally show the efficiency and feasibility of BPPSVC through rigorous experimental results.},

	abstract = {The concept of smart contract represents one of the most attractive uses of blockchain technology and has the advantage of being transparent, immutable, and corruption-free. However, blockchain is a highly resource demanding technology. The ambition of this paper is to propose a new approach for defining lightweight smart contracts, offering a high level of trust even without blockchain, when the underlying operating system can be trusted. Blockchain can be used for a higher degree of trust, for instance when the runtime system cannot be trusted. The approach gives transparency and immutability, and gives protection against corrupted or incorrect smart contract implementations. This is achieved by letting smart contract requirement specifications be separated from the smart contract implementations, provided by special objects, so-called history objects, recording all transactions of the associated contract. The history objects are generated by the runtime system as specially protected objects. Contract partners may interact with the history objects through predefined interfaces. We present a framework which includes an executable, imperative language for writing smart contracts, a functional language for contract specifications by means of invariants over the transaction history of a contract, as well as a verification system. The framework allows compositional and class-wise verification. A history object can provide runtime checking of specified behavioral properties of the contract, and can provide safety, security, and privacy control, as well as trusted transfer of assets. We demonstrate the approach on an auction system.},

We then propose a novel distributed multilevel EMR (d-EMR) management scheme, which uses blockchain to address security concerns and enables selective sharing of medical records among staff members that belong to different levels of a hierarchical institution. We deploy smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain and utilize a distributed storage system to alleviate the dependence on the record-generating institutions to manage and share patient records. To preserve privacy of patient records, our smart contract is designed to allow patients to verify attributes prior to granting access rights. We provide extensive security, privacy, and evaluation analyses to show that our proposed scheme is both efficient and practical.},

	abstract = {The demand for electricity increases rapidly along with the advancement of the industrial age. To ensure efficient distribution of the electricity, maintain low losses and high level of quality, and the security of electricity supply, the smart grid concept was proposed. The concept enables a small, individual scale to generate electricity and sell it to the grid. However, the concept adds complexity to the existing system, such as how a transaction between these generators and consumers are conducted, verified and recorded. This paper proposes the blockchain as a tool to manage transactions in the smart grid. Transactions are performed with smart contracts, and the network acts as a transaction verifier. The blockchain provides immutability of the transactions, which ensure every transaction between generators and consumers will always be executed. It also provides immutability to transaction history, which can be used for audit or solving a transaction dispute.},

	abstract = {Data leakage in electronic health records (EHRs) could result in the compromise of patient privacy (e.g. medical conditions). Generally most data in EHRs remain unchanged once they are uploaded to the system; thus, blockchain can be potentially used to facilitate the sharing of such data. Different participating medical organizations and individuals (e.g. medical practitioners, hospitals, medical labs and insurance companies) can then access EHRs stored on the blockchain with a higher level of confidence. In this paper, a blockchain based searchable encryption scheme for EHRs is proposed. The index for EHRs is constructed through complex logic expressions and stored in the blockchain, so that a data user can utilize the expressions to search the index. As only the index is migrated to the blockchain to facilitate propagation, the data owners have full control over who can see their EHRs data. The use of blockchain technology ensures the integrity, anti-tampering, and traceability of EHRs’ index. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated from two aspects, namely in terms of the overhead for extracting the document IDs from EHRs and the overhead associated with conducting transactions on smart contract in Ethereum.},

The relationship between the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and the Internet is struggling to keep up with this number of patients. The transmission of Patient Health Records (PHR) to the care of a patient through Internet plays an important role in the remote monitoring and fast detection of new contaminated patient with coronavirus. Moreover, it has generated significant security and privacy concerns for the global health care system due to tampering of control messages. This paper focuses on the application of blockchain and smart contract mechanisms to solve the shortcomings of the current health application and propose a new security schema based on context-aware CP-ABE. The proposed schema includes context-aware policies to achieve a robust authentication of identity and confidentiality of patient's healthcare data. Therefore, the proposed schema shows promising results in enhancing security and minimizing encryption time in Fog cloud environments based on proxy-fog and reinforcement of security policies.},

Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users’ privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.},

Unfortunately, the IoT devices have limited resources to handle the performance of big data feature learning with machine learning techniques. IoT devices often compromise the privacy of users and make them vulnerable to numerous cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication protocol based on blockchain technology and the secret computational model of physically unclonable function (denoted by PUF model). The proposed protocol guarantees the users privacy with a decentralized smart contract blockchain with the PUF model. In practice, the proposed protocol guarantees that IoT devices and the miner are authenticated in a faster authentication process compared to current blockchain techniques. In addition, Blockchain and PUF combine to ensure data provenance and data transparency in IoT networks. Blockchain-based smart contracts provide decentralized digital ledgers that are able to withstand data tampering attacks. This ensures the security and privacy of outsourced big data in IoT environments. We also investigated the privacy implications of using IoT devices with various security analysis, and avenues for research to extenuate the privacy concerns in IoT environments.},

	abstract = {The emergence of on-demand service provisioning by Federated Cloud Providers (FCPs) to Cloud Users (CU) has fuelled significant innovations in cloud provisioning models. Owing to the massive traffic, massive CU resource requests are sent to FCPs, and appropriate service recommendations are sent by FCPs. Currently, the Fourth-Generation (4G)-Long Term Evolution (LTE) network faces bottlenecks that affect end-user throughput and latency. Moreover, the data is exchanged among heterogeneous stakeholders, and thus trust is a prime concern. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Blockchain (BC)-leveraged rank-based recommender scheme, FedRec, to expedite secure and trusted Cloud Service Provisioning (CSP) to the CU through the FCP at the backdrop of base 5G communication service. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a BC-integrated request-response broker model is formulated between the CU, Cloud Brokers (BR), and the FCP, where a CU service request is forwarded through the BR to different FCPs. For service requests, Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is supported by 5G-enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service. In the next phase, a weighted matching recommender model is proposed at the FCP sites based on a novel Ranking-Based Recommender (RBR) model based on the CU requests. In the final phase, based on the matching recommendations between the CU and the FCP, Smart Contracts (SC) are executed, and resource provisioning data is stored in the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) that expedite the block validations. The proposed scheme FedRec is compared in terms of SC evaluation and formal verification. In simulation, FedRec achieves a reduction of 27.55\% in chain storage and a transaction throughput of 43.5074 Mbps at 150 blocks. For the IPFS, we have achieved a bandwidth improvement of 17.91\%. In the RBR models, the maximum obtained hit ratio is 0.9314 ​at 200 million CU requests, showing an improvement of 1.2\% in average servicing latency over non-RBR models and a maximization trade-off of QoE index of 2.7688 at the flow request 1.088 and at granted service price of USD 1.559 million to FCP for provided services. The obtained results indicate the viability of the proposed scheme against traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Peak mitigation is of interest to power companies as peak periods may require the operator to over provision supply in order to meet the peak demand. Flattening the usage curve can result in cost savings, both for the power companies and the end users. Integration of renewable energy into the energy infrastructure presents an opportunity to use excess renewable generation to supplement supply and alleviate peaks. In addition, demand side management can shift the usage from peak to off-peak times and reduce the magnitude of peaks. In this work, we present a data driven approach for incentive-based peak mitigation. Understanding user energy profiles is an essential step in this process. We begin by analysing a popular energy research dataset published by the Ausgrid corporation. Extracting aggregated user energy behavior in temporal contexts and semantic linking and contextual clustering give us insight into consumption and rooftop solar generation patterns. We implement, and performance test a blockchain-based prosumer incentivization system. The smart contract logic is based on our analysis of the Ausgrid dataset. Our implementation is capable of supporting 792,540 customers with a reasonably low infrastructure footprint.},

However, there are the security challenges in the existing e-health system, where the malicious doctors may collude with cloud storage service provider (CSP) to tamper with the patients’ EHRs, or directly reveal the content of EHRs to other adversaries for profit. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preserving e-health system to ensure the security and confidentiality of the patients’ EHRs. In the system, we introduce the pairing-based cryptography to generate the tamper-proof records of the EHRs and allow the patients to integrate them into the transactions deployed on the blockchain, which can make the patients’ EHRs verifiable and protect them from illegal modification. Moreover, we will design secure payment protocols by performing blockchain-based smart contracts, which can enable the patients and hospital to reliably pay for the diagnostic and storage service, respectively. Security analysis and the performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient with a limited computation overhead.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-enabled Stackelberg game model is proposed for the Quality-of-Service Optimized Link State Routing (QoS-OLSR) protocol in urban VANET. While QoS-OLSR protocols introduce game models, Stackelberg in specific, to select stable relays, the information exchanged by nodes and the selection process cannot be trusted. The introduction of Blockchain to VANET arose as a means for adding trust. However, existing works integrating blockchain do not fully exploit its capabilities in hosting verified reputations, selecting relays, or sharing monetary incentives to motivate cooperation of relays. Therefore, the proposed Stackelberg game model integrates off-chain QoS-OLSR protocol and designed on-chain smart contracts, which consists of two managers: Node Reputation Manager (NRM) and Relay Selection Game Manager (RSGM) to select relays. The proposed game model has three stages: 1) the role identification, 2) the off-chain follower incentive selection, and 3) the on-chain leader profit maximization. The first stage is for nodes identify their role in the game model; leader or follower. Then, the second stage allows followers (nodes) to calculate incentives for leaders (relays) based on off-chain exchanged QoS-OLSR messages including QoS and reputation. NRM allows verifying the reputations within the messages of nodes. The calculated incentives are deposited to RSGM as followers’ strategies. The third stage, executed on-chain in RSGM, generates the set of accepted followers for a leader reliably and forwards the deposited incentives to leaders. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate that the proposed game model outperforms in terms of leaders’ utility and followers’ payments while keeping the percentage of relays constant compared to the benchmark model. Furthermore, cost analysis confirms the feasibility and cost-efficiency of such a model.},

The original goal was to propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. Now, Blockchain proves to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services. Applications are being explored in healthcare (patient records), government (land registries) and electronics (Internet of Things). The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation. The characteristics of Industry 4.0 meets the blockchain-based system and the model can aid these changes.},

In response to this challenge, a case is presented for a coordinated central bank policy that involves a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for rewarding climate mitigation actions. Justification for the CBDC is framed on a new model for costing externalities and pricing systemic risk. A hypothetical 100-year storyline, called “Avoiding Catastrophe,” is presented to illustrate how the CBDC could be used to mobilize trillions of dollars of new climate finance and manage climate risk. Effectiveness of the CBDC reward is appraised by comparing the 100-year storyline with a speech given by Mark Carney—the Governor of the Bank of England—titled “Resolving the climate paradox.” A technical brief is provided for a CBDC platform, including recommendations for Blockchain ledgers, smart contracts, rules, and strategies for ensuring accountability and scalability.},

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchains have drawn considerable attention from engineers, researchers, and institutions alike; and their implementation has affected fields like e-healthcare, Internet of Things, smart contracts, e-finance, logistics, and so forth. The focus of this chapter shall be the cryptocurrency mechanisms for blockchains. Cryptocurrencies are a new form of virtual currency, first introduced to the masses with the creation of bitcoin, developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. They are a more secure and verified form of transaction, which uses cryptographic protocols in a peer-to-peer system generating a distributed ledger. With the growing popularity of blockchains, a large number of cryptocurrencies have been introduced, greatly changing the prospects of blockchains in the domain of finance. Greater attention is now being paid by stakeholders around the world to various mechanisms of using blockchains in cryptocurrencies. In these blockchain systems, all the committed transactions are stored in a list of blocks with several transactional properties including irreversibility, pseudonymous, security, and global scalability. As both permission and permissionless blockchain platforms are being challenged to meet rigorous real-world application requirements, such as immediate transaction finality, low latencies, good scalability, and high-performance, the limitations of existing consensus models are being recognized. To achieve the necessary agreement in a network among distributed processes, consensus mechanisms are used as fault-tolerant mechanisms in blockchains systems. Many consensus models have been designed and new ones are still emerging to combat the limitations of their predecessors. Models like Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Elapsed Time, and many others that follow open-ended or closed-ended participation have their own advantages and limitations. The consensus mechanism maintains the sanctity of the data and the key properties of the blockchain; the security of the consensus model is perhaps an important measure of the quality of the model. Poor choice of consensus mechanism could lead to blockchain fork, consensus failure, dominance, and poor performance thereby compromising the data recorded on the blockchain. Despite all these challenges, blockchains show immense potential in improving cryptocurrency by bringing numerous opportunities. This chapter provides a primer on the basics of cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology and discusses the existing narratives about the technology’s potential to facilitate efficient mechanisms for financial transactions among others. The principal disciples of the technology are discussed in great detail while also flagging the potential points of concern and conflict surrounding the technology. It concludes with suggestions for future research.},

The data gather intelligent metering equipment from the Internet of Things, while self-enforcing smart contracts identify programmatically the anticipated energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the related benefits or penalties, and the regulations for balancing energy demand with grid-level energy production. Consensus-based validation will be used to validate demand response programs and to enable the flexibility providers’ suitable economic settlement. The method was validated using a prototype of several structures from literature information sets.

	abstract = {In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed energy (DE) transactions exist in various scenarios. This paper attempts to improve the intelligence, real-timeliness, and security of the direct transaction between DE generation companies (DEGCs) and users, and reduce the default frequency of distributed power (DP) transactions. For these purposes, a P2P DE transaction model for the IIoT was proposed based on blockchain. Firstly, a blockchain-based distributed energy peer-to-peer transaction framework is constructed, which is more suitable for generalized energy transactions based on typical transaction scenarios of the IIoT. Using credit value evaluation and smart contracts to ensure the transparency, openness, and non-tampering of credit scores. On this basis, the energy currency reward mechanism is used to promote the trustworthiness of transaction nodes and maintain transaction security. Finally, the P2P direct transaction based on credit value was designed to improve the transaction efficiency and security. Through case analysis, the DE transaction model for the IIoT, which is based on the credit value of the blockchain, supports fast and frequent energy transactions, as it overcomes the confirmation delays of energy blockchain transactions. The proposed model improves the efficiency of DE transactions in the IIoT, effectively suppresses default frequency, and maintains the order of DE market in the IIoT.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid development of cloud computing for many years, data security and trusted computing are still the main challenges in current cloud computing applications. In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter’s secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a “block-and-response” mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme.},

	abstract = {Cold chains are effective in maintaining food quality and reducing food losses, especially for long-distance international food commerce. Several recent reports have demonstrated that frozen foods are serving as carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus from one place to another without any human-to-human contact. This finding highlights significant difficulties facing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and reveal a transmission mechanism that may have substantially worsened the global pandemic. Traditional food cold chain management practices do not include specific procedures related to SARS-CoV-2-related environmental control and information warnings; therefore, such procedures are urgently needed to allow food to be safely transported without transmitting SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a conjoint analysis of COVID-19 and food cold chain systems was performed, and the results of this analysis were used to develop an improved food cold chain management system utilizing internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. First, 45 COVID-19-related food cold chain incidents in China, primarily involving frozen meat and frozen aquatic products, were summarized. Critical food cold chain control points related to COVID-19 were analyzed, including temperature and cold chain requirements. A conceptual system structure to improve food cold chain management, including information sensing, chain linking and credible tracing, was proposed. Finally, a prototype system, which consisted of cold chain environment monitoring equipment, a cold chain blockchain platform, and a food chain management system, was developed. The system includes: 1) a defining characteristic of the newly developed food cold chain system presented here is the use of IoT technology to enhance real-time environmental information sensing capacity; 2) a hybrid data storage mechanism consisting of off-chain and on-chain systems was applied to enhance data security, and smart contracts were used to establish warning levels for food cold chain incidents; and 3) a hypothetical food cold chain failure scenario demonstration in which information collection, intelligent decision making, and cold chain tracing were integrated and automatically generated for decision-making. By integrating existing technologies and approaches, our study provides a novel solution to improve traditional food cold chain management and thus meet the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our system has been shown to be effective, subsequent studies are still required to develop precise risk evaluation models for SARs-CoV-2 in food cold chains and more precisely control the entire process. By ensuring food safety and reliable traceability, our system could also contribute to the formulation of appropriate mechanisms for international cooperation and minimize the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international food commerce.},

While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: “You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical” reveals that this is a futile exercise. Algorithms are also pivotal to the current mania for Crypto-Algorithmic Blockchain Technology Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with a ‘Crypto Tribe’ of Millennials relentlessly raising billions in real money thereby, to the extent that I have dubbed Crypto the Millennials’ Rock'n’Roll. The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious – and there is already ICO litigation on foot.

As the market players, prosumers in the local distribution network are considered in two groups, producers (sellers) and consumers (buyers). Using smart contracts, all sellers and buyers in the proposed market can engage in bilateral energy token transactions (P2P) with each other under an agreed price and with the retail market at a certain price. Furthermore, the local consumers can participate in price-based DR programs and shift their consuming load to the periods with high local generation. Demurrage mechanism is applied to avoid energy token accumulation and enhance attraction for local transactions. With demurrage in place, the redemption value of energy-backed tokens reduces with time. A fully decentralized approach called the primal-dual sub-gradient method is developed to clear this fully decentralized energy market in the presence of DR programs and demurrage. The proposed market-clearing scheme guarantees the global and feasible solution without requiring the players' private information. Numerical studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy token market and the decentralized approach for its clearing.},

	abstract = {Large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources brings new challenges for smart grid management requiring the development of decentralized solutions and active participation of prosumer and non-grid-owned assets. Local energy flexibility markets can help in monitoring energy flows, motivate changes in prosumers’ energy supply and demand, achieving local energy balance, and optimization of electricity flows. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized energy flexibility market enabling small-scale prosumers to trade in a peer-to-peer fashion their flexibility in terms of load modulation concerning the baseline energy profiles. We have defined an energy flexibility token for digitizing the flexibility of prosumers allowing to be traded on the market as an asset and self-enforcing smart contracts for decentralized market operation including functions such as the placement of flexibility bids/offers, trading session management, or energy and financial settlement of energy flexibility transactions. For matching the flexibility bids and offers, a solution based on a greedy heuristic and a bipartite graph is proposed for minimizing the number of flexibility transactions and reducing the blockchain-associated costs, while Oracles are used to assure its secure integration with the blockchain. The blockchain-based flexibility market was validated with the help of the Terni city Distribution System Operator, showing promising results in enabling the self-consumption of renewable energy generated in a small scale urban micro-grid considering live energy monitoring data, and in assuring the local balancing of the demand side in a simulated environment considering many market participants and historical energy data.},

	abstract = {With the growth of the industrial age, the need for energy is continuously increasing. To provide efficient power distribution, instill minimal losses, ensure high quality, and dependable supply security, the smart grid idea has cropped up in conversations that allows for the generation and sale of power on a small, individual scale. However, the strategy enhances existing system issues, such as how are transactions among both producers and users carried out, validated, and documented. For a start, smart grids use smart contracts to conduct transactions, with the network serving as a transaction verifier. The advantages of smart grids over traditional power distribution systems rest in its innovative offerings to customers who until then, for many years, had few options for choosing between generated energy, most of which are based on fossil fuels. Not only was the equipment used to create energy highly costly, making it unsuitable for small-scale applications or personal usage of the users but also customers who generated their own electricity had it distributed by the power grid and only paid for what they used. However, technological advancements have altered how humans create and distribute power. Automation results in mass manufacturing, which results in less expensive power generators. Inventions enabled energy to be generated from solar power, tidal waves, geothermal power, and other non-conventional sources. This created the opportunity for an area, household, or a single person to produce their own electricity. Whenever a person created more energy than they had use for, they could easily sell the extra electricity to others, therefore acting as alternative energy sources. In terms of power supply, the smart grid provides greater assurance. However, the idea of automating an electric grid complicates the already complex electrical system. On a transactional level, how can we ensure that generators supply electricity after the user has paid. Because the network has so many producers and consumers, it causes issues about who can truly authenticate the transaction and how the process will operate. Traditional energy trading strategies focus on a centralized approach or third-party companies, but that might be vulnerable from single-point failure. As a result, a secure and reliable trading strategy must be installed in the system to ensure the data security of customers. In this regard, a new technology known as a blockchain, which is a chain of decentralized and distributed transaction ledgers that each user retains and maintains, can address the issue outlined above. Many of the issues that inhibit the Energy Internet’s growth can be solved by applying the blockchain’s technical benefits to it. The use of blockchain technology in the energy sector is only getting started, but it has a lot of room for growth in the future. Enhanced security, better data protection, data transparency and integrity, elimination of third-party authority and trust, pervasive solutions, and higher data usability are just a few of the advantages. Restricted adaptability and speed, off-chain service demands, expensive building and maintenance costs, and the need for more experimental studies are among the still thorny issues.},

Blockchain technology is envisaged as an electricity exchange platform to minimise the time gap and cost in the trading process. We propose a public electric power exchange service network with a gateway-based privacy-preserving scheme to implement authentication and data encryption for EV charging and discharging from grid peers. A novel consensus mechanism Proof-of-Benefit (PoB) is designed to support automated smart contracts for electric power trading, in which a benefit number generation algorithm is proposed to select the leader for the transaction validation. Meanwhile, the authentication strategy ensures only the participated nodes with valid identities can access the consensus process, and the data encryption is applied to avoid EV behaviour analysis based upon plain transaction flows that would otherwise be exposed in the network. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, a public electric power exchange service platform with a PoB consensus mechanism achieves a higher scalability and lower grid load variance while maintaining a high accuracy rate of correct electric power transactions against Sybil attacks and a faster (lower time consumption) authentication process when compared with other blockchain-enabled authentication methods (e.g. FairAccess, Bubbles of trust, and so on) used as the baseline.},

In this study, we first investigate the power grid modernization and the transition toward intelligent power systems. Smart grids introduce more reliable, secure, efficient, and sustainable energy delivery to the consumers by engaging demand side in load-generation balance. Further, we introduce blockchain-based energy trading as a means to expedite the decentralization of interdependent power and energy networks by enabling decentralized transactions and smart contracts.

	abstract = {Data crowdsourcing is a distributed data acquisition method to efficiently collect a sizeable amount of high-quality data from a large network of contributors who participate in data trading activities. However, traditional data crowdsourcing platforms are almost invariably based on a centralized architecture, which tends to give unfair advantages to the platform operator; besides, centralized platforms are obvious targets for cybersecurity attacks and become a single point of failure. Furthermore, a centralized approach with stringent security control also suffers from serious scalability issue. For example, if data owners manage a database with large amounts of valuable data, they have to retrieve data from their database in accordance with certain access policies and encrypt retrieved data for each requester; hence they become bottlenecks in the data trading process when the number of requesters is very large. To address the above issues, we propose a blockchain-based mechanism for fine-grained authorization in data crowdsourcing (BC-FGA-DCrowd). In the BC-FGA-DCrowd scheme, we use a public blockchain to implement cryptocurrencies and payment services as incentive schemes for data trading platform users. With this approach, data owners can employ Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to pre-process the complex encryption workload, and generate the attribute private key for data requester to achieve the fine-grained authorization. In this paper, we also prove that the BC-FGA-DCrowd scheme satisfies the correctness and fairness requirements of data trading, and can effectively withstand malicious activities of internal users and external DDos and Sybil attackers. The approach was tested on a private Ethereum network using Ganache with a local host.},

We focus on benchmarking blockchain strategies applied to distributed methods for sharing records of gene-drug interactions. We expect this type of sharing will expedite personalized medicine. Basic Procedures We generated gene-drug interaction test datasets using the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) resource. We developed three blockchain-based methods to share patient records on gene-drug interactions: Query Index, Index Everything, and Dual-Scenario Indexing. Main Findings We achieved a runtime of about 60 s for importing 4,000 gene-drug interaction records from four sites, and about 0.5 s for a data retrieval query. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible to leverage blockchain as a new platform to share data among institutions.

In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {The tightly regulated energy market has taken notice of blockchain technology as it prepares for an energy business model transition in which providers and consumers will create and sell electricity. Blockchain could provide a secure, low-cost mechanism to record and confirm operating and financial transactions along a decentralized system with no central authority. In addition to the smart grid, the Internet of Energy (IoE), which integrates many kinds of energies, has become a prominent innovation feature in the energy generation and distribution landscape. Given the establishing of a distributed smart grid infrastructure, it follows that IoE leverages the Internet to gather, control, optimize, and organize network energy information from various edge devices. Customers and suppliers use sensors and modern communication systems to collect the required data and forecast demand and supply. The present energy sector began changing towards distributed and decentralized approaches with smart grid energy utilities like electric vehicles, smart grid, and vehicle-to-grid technologies. The founding principles of blockchain, such as secrecy, decentralization, and transparency, have sparked an interest in the energy domain for this technology which provides automatic data interchange, complicated energy trades, improved service control, and distributed energy trading, among other things, by utilizing smart contracts. As decentralized renewable resources and smart grid networks are implemented and exploited, blockchain plays a critical role in developing the IoE market.},

	abstract = {Operators are coming up with new solutions that use grid topology as an innovative response to future mobility requirements and the increasing management costs for wireless access networks. Proximity Radio Access Network (P-RAN), which was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), expands the cellular structure from base station to intelligent terminal equipment through device to device (D2D) technology, which provides a cost-effective deployment solution for the 5G and 6G. The extensive deployment of P-RAN solution should be based on the active participation of a large number of distributed intelligent equipment users. Fair, reasonable and credible incentive solution is the key to realize the sustainable operation of this distributed system. This paper introduces a technical solution that applying blockchain technology to design P-RAN operating and incentive mechanism. Through blockchain technology, the current centralized P-RAN operation and incentive can be achieved in point-to-point way. By utilizing blockchain-based identity authentication and asymmetric key pairs, user and relay can confirm and sign the network usage information in sequence to reduce disputes. The abstract of all transactions related to P-RAN services can be recorded on blockchain immutably as the calculation basis of relay rewards. Through smart contracts and P-RAN incentive policy, relays that provide more and higher quality P-RAN service will be rewarded more, which can help to create positive feedback in this decentralized system. The tokens awarded to relays will be able to exchange through the blockchain network for the increase of the whole ecosystem utility. Blockchain-based P-RAN operation and incentive solution pioneer a way to the future heterogeneous network resource sharing and collaboration for supporting Web3.0 and Metaverse.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of management a residential storage system with distributed generation. With the introduction of a hybrid AC/DC inverter in this system, efficient energy management is realized to achieve the minimization of the cost of the energy balance among purchasing, renewable generation, curtailment and reserve capacity. This cost reduction is achieved by either meeting the load or selling surplus energy, and dispensing a residential demand load controller. To address the dynamic problem and with uncertainties regarding the load, renewable energy, and energy purchase and sale tariffs, a mixed integer linear programming model was developed with adjustable robust programming (ADJ-ROBUST-MILP), and it also involves technical restrictions and criteria for increasing the life cycle of the storage system. The dynamic aspect imparts practical applicability via the permanent correction of the ADJ-ROBUST-MILP solution with a heuristic that acts proactively in the developed dynamics by observing prior conditions. The case studies demonstrate that the mathematical heuristic is able to confer benefit to the energy scheduling of smart home energy management while presenting computational complexity capable of being used in real systems, which is exemplified herein.},

	abstract = {The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less “digital twins” for industrial IOT applications.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers, with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3’s Corda, Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is its role in creating “clean data”: validated, trustable, interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes, and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties), and asset tokens (Primalbase).},

	abstract = {Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96\% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18\% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85\% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.},

	abstract = {Data- and knowledge-driven service-oriented smart maintenance decision-making is becoming a current research topic in complex multi-component systems. In it, the comprehensive data and knowledge from different stakeholders such as users, OEMs, and service providers contribute to determining the optimal decision-making schemes. However, the traditional centralized systems or platforms lead to the reluctant cross-organization knowledge sharing for each stakeholder. Meanwhile, although the promising blockchain technology is fit to solve the centralized sharing problems, it little considers the service-oriented maintenance decision-making (SOMD) processes. Moreover, it also ignores the collaborative sharing relationships that generate requests, induce services and respond knowledge among different stakeholders. Thus, in order to solve these problems, this paper focuses on the SOMD processes, and innovatively proposes a decision-making oriented collaborative knowledge sharing framework and multi-channel distributed blockchain network MKShareNet. The network architecture, lifecycle smart contracts, token reward mechanisms, and collaborative knowledge transaction operation logics are all designed. Finally, the prototype system on complex CNC honing machining tools is implemented and the collaborative sharing is verified. It shows that the proposed MKShareNet and system could effectively implement the sequential and incentive knowledge sharing among different stakeholders for maintenance planning.},
