	abstract = {This conceptual article seeks to integrate blockchain into current theory on the governance of inter-organizational exchanges within business networks. It posits that a blockchain governance structure comprised of administrative, platform, and application level mechanisms represents a significant new antecedent and causal factor determining the extent of the need for the traditional contractual and relational mechanisms of governance. Further, that blockchain delivered governance can perform the functions of transaction coordination and safeguarding which are required in order to substitute for those traditional mechanisms of governance. A discussion points the way towards empirical verification of the framework created, and towards avenues for further theoretical research, and examines the implications of blockchain delivered governance for practitioners. In developing this framework, this article also seeks to make a contribution by placing attention on the need for the building of theory applying to blockchain, and for quantitative measurement of the effects of blockchain on organizations and business networks. This article concludes that the emergence of blockchain technology now provides the means by which automation of the specification, validation, and enforcement of private ordering between exchange participants can be achieved, and that this should stimulate a reevaluation of existing theories of inter-organizational governance.},

It is designed to maintain the quality of sensitive goods during the whole shipment. Centralized supply chain management systems expose the supply chain to corruption, fraud, and tampering. Blockchain has emerged as a new distributed information technology; it represents a new approach in supply chain area, where visibility and transparency of product flows are the principal challenges. This paper describes how the blockchain can be integrated into the supply chain architecture to create a reliable, transparent, authentic and secure system. To reach this goal, we studied the benefits of introducing the blockchain to the supply chain and the challenges encountered in a blockchain-based supply chain management ecosystem. We combined theoretical and real-world application studies to build our theory about the requirements for an efficient blockchain-based supply chain.},

In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that are used for verifying and enforcing the terms of an agreement. Ethereum is an extensively used platform that can be used to execute smart contracts. These can be defined by using high-level languages such as Solidity, Vyper and Bamboo that are compiled into low-level machine instructions, i.e., bytecode. These instructions define a Turing complete language and are often represented by using a readable format that is referred to as opcodes. Here, we present a novel, more comprehensive, study that aims at gaining a precise understanding on how programmers use the linguistic instructions supported by Ethereum. More precisely, the contracts’ source code has been also analysed, in order to understand the high-level control structures and core instructions that are used for smart contract definitions, and how they are reflected on the opcode level. We have gathered ten of thousands of verified Ethereum smart contracts that have been written by using the Solidity language. This study can lay the groundwork for defining new formalisms and new domain specific languages (DSL). These can support the users in the development of decentralised applications (DAPPs).},

The novelty of the study lies specifically in the unprecedented use of constrained sensing devices as trustworthy data sources for a permissionless blockchain. Furthermore, we show how our research results, advancing the State-of-the-Art in the IoT and blockchain interactions, can support the interests of a diverse set of water management stakeholders in a concrete use-case implementation. To assess our contribution and validate our results we use a system architecture comprising constrained IoT devices for measuring water consumption used as direct data-source actors, a public blockchain infrastructure, and smart contracts that represent the interests of different water management stakeholders and regulate the distribution of incentives amongst virtuous farmers. Further validation on the usability of our results is obtained through the real implementation of a complete use case featuring the Ethereum network as a public blockchain and where six different types of IoT platforms are individually assessed for impact on the IoT devices, in terms of energy, processing time, and available memory. The findings show how solutions based on the proposed architecture can be implemented with only 6\% of additional energy budget compared to the normal operations of the IoT devices. Besides showing new means to energy-efficiently integrate IoT data sources in a permissionless blockchain, the validation results make our contribution a strong candidate for use in automated and incentive-based irrigation water management systems as well as a key component in fostering increased sustainability of the whole agricultural sector.},

Based on the combination of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform and G-Cloud solutions, our proposal consists of the design of an e-Participation model that uses a tokenizable system of the actions and processes undertaken by citizens in participatory processes providing incentives to promote greater participation in public affairs. In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.},

This paper presents the design, the prototype implementation and the analysis of a decentralized, real-time, uniform-price double auction energy market. The proposed market is a distributed and decentralized application and its rules may be specified through a smart contract. Market participants interact with the smart contract sending their asks and offers and the distributed application clears the market based on a uniform-price economic dispatch model. We propose and analyze three different implementation approaches on an Ethereum blockchain network. A model representing a physical demonstration project conducted in Seattle, USA, is utilized to simulate the power grid and to provide real-life scenarios for our analysis. We systematically evaluate our three implementation approaches and elucidate several blockchain issues regarding the decentralization of next-generation energy markets. In particular, we identify that certain computation modules may be installed on smart consuming devices in order to increase efficiency, security and decentralization and reduce the overall blockchain overhead cost. Furthermore, we show that in order to fulfill the market’s high demand for step timing, we ought to have the block generation time several magnitudes smaller compared to the auction period.},

If a transaction exceeds the amount of gas allotted by the user (known as gas limit), an out-of-gas exception is raised and its execution is interrupted. One of the main open problems in the analysis of Ethereum smart contracts is the inference of sound bounds on their gas consumption. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first static analysis that is able to infer sound parametric (i.e., non-constant) gas bounds for smart contracts. The inferred bounds can be parametric on the sizes of the input parameters for the functions, but also they can be parametric on the contract state, or blockchain data. Our gas analysis is developed at EVM bytecode level, in which Ethereum gas model is defined. Our analysis is implemented in a tool named Gastap, Gas-Aware Smart contracT Analysis Platform, which takes as input a smart contract and automatically infers sound gas upper-bounds for its public functions. Gastap has been applied over 318,093 functions fetched from the Ethereum blockchain, and succeeded to obtain gas bounds for 90.24\% of them.},

The low cost of access and fast spread speed greatly enriches people’s spiritual life, but it also poses great challenges to the protection of intellectual property rights. Nowadays, although the intellectual property rights of music works have been better valued and protected, there are still some problems that limit the development of the music industry and affect the users’ experience. For example, the copyrights of different music works may be exclusively represented by different companies, resulting in limited choices for users and vicious competition among music operating companies, which affects the users’ experience and is not conducive to the long-term development of the music industry. In order to solve the above problems, we present a decentralized music copyright operation management system based on Blockchain technology. By using the Blockchain’s shared ledger mechanism and smart contracts as the basic framework of the Ethereum platform, we realize decentralized music copyright management. The system not only protects copyright better, but also coordinates the interests of creators, copyright owners, operators and users, which is beneficial to the further development of the music industry, and creates more value and better experience for users.},

We propose blockchain-based management systems (BMSs) as new governance tools to improve traceability, transparency, and decentralization of transactions in the sharing economy. We build a BMS prototype for the management of co-working spaces (CWSs). In particular, we show how a blockchain can be used to track transactions between users (e.g., rent payments), and to advertise or store information about a given space (e.g., building specifications, IP conceived within the space). A large amount of data will be permanently and securely stored on ledger and made available to both institutions and corporations, providing a wide range of new governance tools and services to local authorities of the future.

It is an effective and efficient way of data collection, processing and delivery of results to the users, from the users and for the users. All the entities that make up a Mobile crowd sensing system be it a worker, requester or miner can be represented as a node. All the nodes interact together to make a trustworthy system where there is a limited or no scope of deception. The traditional approach to crowd sensing gives little importance to communication between the nodes and in most cases, it assumes the communication happens through a secure channel and ignores the potential hazards. We propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized and collaborative approach to communicate between the nodes which would help workers/users to interact in real-time and solve conflicts should there be any. To decentralize we use the blockchain technology to overcome single point of failure which is a major issue, as mentioned peer-to-peer link between nodes is more expensive only but it improvise the security and privacy concerns by using the consensus mechanism. With the aim of improving the traditional communication technology between the nodes, we propose a mechanism based on Kafka, blockchain and RSA encryption for continuous exchange of data between the nodes which would help to enhance the security and efficiency of the system.},

Ethereum is currently the largest platform for smart contracts, and anomaly detection is imminent. However, the data related to smart contracts is huge and contains complex objects and relationships. It is impossible to extract high-order attributes and low efficiency using traditional methods. The key to reduce fraud is extracting features from complex smart contracts and effectively identifying abnormal contracts. Therefore, this paper constructs a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Networks (S\_HGTNs) suitable for smart contract anomaly detection to detect financial fraud on the Ethereum platform. For feature representation, this paper first extracts the features to construct a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) for smart contract, and uses the relationship matrix obtained from the meta-path learned in the transformer network as the input of the convolution network, and finally uses the node embedding for classification tasks. The classification results show that this model performs better than the traditional model and the standard deviation is small, which proves the effectiveness and stability of the model.},

A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them.

Even worse, fixing bugs in a deployed smart contract is difficult, so developers must detect security vulnerabilities in a smart contract before deployment. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection efforts heavily rely on fixed rules defined by experts, which are inefficient and inflexible. To overcome the limitations of existing vulnerability detection approaches, we propose a GNN based approach for smart contract vulnerability detection. First, we construct a graph representation for a smart contract function with syntactic and semantic features by combining abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and program dependency graph (PDG). To further strengthen the presentation ability of our approach, we perform program slicing to normalize the graph and eliminate the redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities. Then, we use a Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural-Network model with hybrid attention pooling to identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contract functions. Empirical results show that our approach can achieve 89.2\% precision and 92.9\% recall in smart contract vulnerability detection on our dataset and reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

While some solutions already address traceability issues in supply chain management and manufacturing, customized and volatile industries, in which each product features a unique configuration, are still lacking appropriate models and proofs of concept. In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures. The proposed blockchain architecture is based on a consortium Ethereum network and a Proof of Authority consensus, which delivers a trusted and shared database within an economic processing framework. To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract.

	abstract = {The dynamic, massive, and lightweight properties of the Internet of Things device nodes lead to complicated application environments, and traditional access control mechanisms cannot match the current security requirements of the Internet of Things. Although attribute encryption schemes support more fine-grained access control, their overt access policies can endanger users’ privacy. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an Internet of Things access control mechanism based on blockchain and inner product encryption. First, the mechanism employs blockchain technology to provide distributed and decentralized access control management in the Internet of Things, allowing for dynamic management of the Internet of Things data while avoiding the problem of a single point of failure. And utilizing the tamper-evident feature of blockchain, this system stores the hash value of the ciphertext in the third-party storage on the chain to ensure the integrity of the ciphertext so that the third-party storage can be trusted. Furthermore, malicious user access is prevented by deploying smart contracts on the blockchain, which provide automatic and traceable access control to massive amounts of Internet of Things data. Then, in order to guarantee data security and user privacy for lightweight Internet of Things devices, fine-grained access control and complete hiding of access policies are achieved using the property of vector representation of attributes in inner product encryption. Finally, the experimental findings reveal that the mechanism has high efficiency while providing security and can meet the particular access control requirements of the Internet of Things.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business processes can be seen as smart contracts, as they are oftentimes adopted to express agreements among different organizations. Indeed, they provide mechanisms to formalize the obligations of each involved party. For instance, collaborative business processes can specify when a certain task should be executed, under which conditions a service should be offered to the other participants, and how physical objects and information should be manipulated. In this setting, to prevent misuse of smart contracts and services and information provided, it is paramount to guarantee by design that security requirements are fulfilled. With the rise in popularity of blockchains, several approaches exploiting the trusted smart contract execution environment offered by this technology to enforce collaborative business processes have been proposed. Yet, the complexity of business processes, security requirements, and blockchain applications calls for an engineering approach that guides the design of secure business processes. Such an approach should both take advantage of the possibilities offered by blockchain technology to enforce some security requirements (e.g., non-repudiation), and take into account the limitations blockchain poses for other security requirements (e.g., confidentiality). However, we are not aware of any existing work that aims at addressing such issues following a similar approach. In this article, we propose SecBPMN2BC: a model-driven approach to designing business processes with security requirements that are meant to be deployed on blockchains. SecBPMN2BC consists of: (i) an extension of BPMN 2.0 that allows designing secure smart contracts; (ii) a set of algorithms and their implementation that check incompatible security requirements and help the design of smart contracts; (iii) a workflow that guides the application of the method. The method has been validated with a survey conducted on security and BPMN experts.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are currently en vogue, thanks to the infrastructure provided by the blockchain technology. However, their effective use requires that the textual (legalese) specification of the contract be accompanied by a precise computational definition of the actions leading to its satisfaction or breach, as well as of their admissible sequences. Insofar as contracts can be viewed as prescribing transactional exchanges of well-specified resources among well-specified actors, contract execution can be modelled as following some protocol in a closed world. This suggests a modelling of such executions as interactive processes in reaction systems, where the entities in the background set represent possible allocations of resources to actors and reactions describe changes in such allocations. We use this type of reaction systems and interactive processes as a basis for the modelling of transactions and contracts and explore properties of such processes, highlighting their peculiarities with respect to the original notion of interactive processes in reaction systems. We also discuss several constructions for composition and decomposition of processes, which guarantee equivalence of effects: two interactive processes are equivalent if, starting from the same initial set of allocations, they produce the same final set of allocations.},

The coordination of forecasts requires a powerful incentive alignment approach. This work proposes a smart contract equipped consortium blockchain system that creates an incentive structure that makes coordination with respect to forecasts economically appealing. Distortions of demand information due to uncoordinated forecasting are captured by a bullwhip measure that factors both forecast error and variance. Cooperation under the system is shown to help minimize this bullwhip measure, thus generating new outcomes for the participants that allow for a higher reward. Under a fixed payout structure, the system achieves credibility of continued cooperation, thus promoting an optimally coordinated equilibrium between retailer and supplier.

Recently, machine learning technology has been widely applied in vulnerability detection for smart contracts. However, it implements effective smart contract vulnerability detection still faces a major challenge, that is, there is a problem of insufficient labeled data in the current field. Active learning can label data more efficiently. Nevertheless, classical active learning only uses limited labeled data for model training, contrary to the deep learning of a large amount of data required for model training. Because of the above, we provide a new framework, called ASSBert, that leverages active and semi-supervised bidirectional encoder representation from transformers network, which is dedicated to completing the task of smart contract vulnerability classification with a little amount of labeled code data and a large number of unlabeled code data. In our framework, active learning is responsible for selecting highly uncertain code data from unlabeled sol files and putting them into the training set after manual labeling. Besides, semi-supervised learning is charged to continuously pick a certain number of high-confidence unlabeled code data from unlabeled sol files, and put them into the training dataset behind pseudo-labeling. Intuitively, by combining active learning and semi-supervised learning, we are able to get more valuable data to increase the performance of our detection model. In our experiments, we collect our benchmark dataset included 6 vulnerabilities in about 20829 smart contracts. The result of the experiment demonstrates that our framework is superior to the baseline methods with a little amount of labeled code data and a large number of unlabeled code data.},

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked.},

Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource “scarcity” and on the environment.},

	abstract = {Many of today's companies use Smart Contracts to represent and execute their business processes. Smart contracts are self-executed programs running over blockchain. In this context, composite smart contracts are used to represent collaborative business processes. A composite smart contract is a smart contract that needs to execute other contracts using external calls to achieve its tasks. Composite smart contracts, through the use of external calls and the execution of other smart contracts that might belong to other owners or companies, bring many challenges with regard to security requirements. As a result, special efforts must be done to ensure composite smart contracts security verification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to verify the security and the correctness of the composite smart contracts written in solidity in Ethereum blockchain. This approach is based on the finite state machine models and model checking method for modeling and verifying the composite smart contracts respectively. We consider seven security properties as well as the security issues that depend on the contract context to be checked in the composite smart contract. For this, we provide two different yet complementary types of verification. The first type of verification is applied to all smart contracts with properties called in our approach “standard properties” that represent the generic ones, while the second type considers the context-dependent properties that we called “specific properties” varying from one smart contract to another. Finally, we express all properties using computation tree logic formulae and we use the nuXmv symbolic model checker to verify the model against all properties. This approach is validated using a different set of solidity smart contracts.},

	abstract = {The concept of smart contract represents one of the most attractive uses of blockchain technology and has the advantage of being transparent, immutable, and corruption-free. However, blockchain is a highly resource demanding technology. The ambition of this paper is to propose a new approach for defining lightweight smart contracts, offering a high level of trust even without blockchain, when the underlying operating system can be trusted. Blockchain can be used for a higher degree of trust, for instance when the runtime system cannot be trusted. The approach gives transparency and immutability, and gives protection against corrupted or incorrect smart contract implementations. This is achieved by letting smart contract requirement specifications be separated from the smart contract implementations, provided by special objects, so-called history objects, recording all transactions of the associated contract. The history objects are generated by the runtime system as specially protected objects. Contract partners may interact with the history objects through predefined interfaces. We present a framework which includes an executable, imperative language for writing smart contracts, a functional language for contract specifications by means of invariants over the transaction history of a contract, as well as a verification system. The framework allows compositional and class-wise verification. A history object can provide runtime checking of specified behavioral properties of the contract, and can provide safety, security, and privacy control, as well as trusted transfer of assets. We demonstrate the approach on an auction system.},

	abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) represent today a big communication channel where users spend a lot of time to share personal data. Unfortunately, the big popularity of OSNs can be compared with their big privacy issues. Indeed, several recent scandals have demonstrated their vulnerability. Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the current centralized OSNs. DOSNs do not have a service provider that acts as central authority and users have more control over their information. Several DOSNs have been proposed during the last years. However, the decentralization of the social services requires efficient distributed solutions for protecting the privacy of users. During the last years the blockchain technology has been applied to Social Networks in order to overcome the privacy issues and to offer a real solution to the privacy issues in a decentralized system. However, in these platforms the blockchain is usually used as a storage, and content is public. In this paper, we propose a manageable and auditable access control framework for DOSNs using blockchain technology for the definition of privacy policies. The resource owner uses the public key of the subject to define auditable access control policies using Access Control List (ACL), while the private key associated with the subject’s Ethereum account is used to decrypt the private data once access permission is validated on the blockchain. We provide an evaluation of our approach by exploiting the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet to deploy the smart contracts. Experimental results clearly show that our proposed ACL-based access control outperforms the Attribute-based access control (ABAC) in terms of gas cost. Indeed, a simple ABAC evaluation function requires 280,000 gas, instead our scheme requires 61,648 gas to evaluate ACL rules.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows virtual disintermediation and automatization of property transactions, which might help to design future platforms, intended to facilitate cross-border transactions within the EU and worldwide. To this end, users of these blockchain-based platforms may create the so-called “digital tokens” or “colored coins” that aim to represent rights over different types of “real world” assets. By transferring a digital token, the parties aim to transfer the ownership or other property rights over the asset represented by the token without the intervention of traditional intermediaries, such as real estate conveyancers, land registrars or notaries specializing in real estate. However, this new technological tool raises several questions in the field of private law, such as the legal nature of the token, how the effective transfer of the property rights operates or how ownership rules may be applied in this decentralized environment (e.g. rights and duties of the token holder). Some of the issues at stake have only been tentatively addressed by both lawmakers and academia. In light of this research gap, this paper addresses these controversial issues from both a private law and a comparative perspective, and proposes a model to tokenize the right of usufruct over chattels and real estate, analyzing its legal viability and limitations across six jurisdictions. The paper concludes that private law rules may be adapted to the tokenization of property rights, which may contribute to the establishment of a digital market for the trading of asset-backed tokens worldwide.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts have triggered polarised discussions. They have been applauded as a significant technological achievement, but also criticised as a dumb idea. Their application is rapidly expanding in the financial sector, public sector, supply chain management, and the automobile, real estate, insurance, and health care industries. With the growing use of smart contracts and an increasing variety of smart contracts applications, the debate over the legal implications of this phenomenon has intensified and many legal issues related to smart contracts are being examined. Legal scholars have highlighted potential legal pitfalls, controversies and incompatibilities with existing legal frameworks. Blockchain technology and smart contracts have also been fuelling an interest of legislators, who have begun to recognise regulatory uncertainties and are making the first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to address them. This paper aims to highlight the fervour of the scholarly debate surrounding smart contracts and contrast it with a rather modest response from the legislators thus far. The paper reiterates that smart contracts represent the future. Even though they challenge practitioners, scholars, and legislators, current legislative initiatives indicate that under most legal systems there are no major obstacles for smart contracts and to accommodate smart contracts within the existing legal frameworks we should expect legal evolution rather than revolution.},

	abstract = {Prosumer companies exchanging utility surpluses in Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) is a promising alternative for industrial symbiosis to lower investment risks, take advantage of existing capacity and cut emissions. To incentivize participation in EIPs, a trustful mechanism is needed to negotiate and enforce terms of exchange. In this work, a peer-to-peer market of software agents representing different companies in automated negotiations of utility exchanges within an EIP is proposed. Agents will learn to strategically negotiate terms of exchanges while considering private preferences, necessities, and the public negotiation context of this market. Design details for the market comprising technological enablers such as Internet of Things, Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications are presented. Moreover, the influence of learning context-dependent strategies on negotiation outcomes and market efficiency is analyzed. Results obtained are promising since social welfare and near equilibrium conditions emerge despite the selfish nature of participating companies and individual contextual perceptions of negotiation agents.},

	abstract = {Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being the automated creation of smart contracts. Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract = {The immutable nature of Ethereum transactions, and consequently Ethereum smart-contracts, has stimulated the proliferation of many approaches aiming at detecting defects and security issues before the deployment of smart-contracts on the blockchain. Indeed, the actions performed by smart-contracts instantiated on the blockchain, possibly involving substantial financial value, cannot be undone. Unfortunately, smart-contracts source code is not always available, hence approaches based on static analysis have very often to face the problem of inspecting the compiled Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, retrieved directly from the blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of EVM bytecode (especially in jumps address resolution), the state-of-the-art static analysis-based solutions have poor accuracy in the automated detection of Ethereum smart-contracts programming defects and vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel approach based on symbolic execution of the EVM operands stack that allows to resolve jumps address in the EVM bytecode and to construct a precise Control-Flow Graph (CFG) of compiled smart-contracts. Many static analysis techniques are based on a CFG-based representation of the smart-contract to validate, and would therefore benefit from our approach. We have implemented the CFG reconstruction algorithm in a tool called EtherSolve . Then, we have validated the tool on a large dataset of real-world Ethereum smart-contracts, showing that EtherSolve extracts more precise CFGs, w.r.t. state-of-the-art available approaches. Finally, we have extended EtherSolve with two detectors for two of the most prominent Ethereum smart-contracts vulnerabilities (Reentrancy and Tx.origin). Experimental results show that exploiting the proposed CFG reconstruction static analysis, leads to more accurate vulnerabilities detection, w.r.t. state-of-the-art security tools.

Against this research gap, the paper introduces a DLT-based shared ledger solution in a formal way and compliant with Financial Reporting Standards. We build on the COFRIS accounting ontology (grounded on UFO) and the blockchain ontology developed by De Kruijff \& Weigand that distinguishes between a Datalogical level, an Infological and an Essential (conceptual) level. It is shown how both consensual and enterprise-specific parts of the business exchange transaction can be represented in a concise way, and how this pattern can be implemented using Smart Contracts. It is argued that the proposed Shared Ledger Accounting system increases the quality of the contents from an accounting perspective as well as the quality of the system in terms of auditability and interoperability.},

	abstract = {High administrative costs and associated operational inefficiencies present multiple challenges for pension industries across different countries. Although blockchain is considered a potential solution for these concerns, the pension industry has not fully leveraged this disruptive technology. This paper provides a blueprint for a blockchain-based end-to-end digital transformation of the pension industry. First, we identified the pre-requisites for blockchain adoption in pension. Then, we developed an architectural design of blockchain-based re-designed pension business processes. Subsequently, we elaborated on how smart contracts can make pension transactions in such redesigned processes optimized, automated, and error-free. Finally, we presented how blockchain can be integrated with the existing pension IT systems, using an API layer, to enable seamless onboarding of all pension participants to a single digital platform – a critical ask for any blockchain implementation. We concluded with an elucidation of the potential of such blockchain-based digital transformation of the pension industry in reducing turnaround time, lowering operating expenses, and facilitating the achievement of other pension reform agendas. This architecture of a blockchain-enabled pension network represents a flexible and scalable knowledge construct that can act as a foundation for further investigations by pension regulators or pension industry participants interested in achieving technology-driven pension operations reforms.},

In this paper, we propose a smart contract testing methodology that bestows developers with flexible, practical and customizable strategies to detect vulnerabilities. Our work enforces strong whitebox knowledge to a series of supervised multimodal tasks under static analysis. Each task encapsulates a vulnerability detection branch test and pipelines feature selection, dimension unification, feature fusion, model training and decision-making. We exploit multiple features made up of code and graph embeddings at the single modality level (intramodal settings) and across individual modalities (intermodal settings). We assign each task to either intramodal or intermodal settings, and show how to train state-of-the-art self-attentive bi-LSTM, textCNN, and random forest (RF) models to extract a joint multimodal feature representation per task. We evaluate our framework over 101,082 functions extracted from the SmartEmbed dataset, and rank each multimodal vulnerability mining strategy in terms of detection performance. Extensive experiments show that our work outperforms existing schemes, and the highest performance reaches 99.71\%.},
