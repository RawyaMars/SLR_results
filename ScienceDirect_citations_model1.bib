	abstract = {The health insurance industry requires a secure data management architecture characterized by reliable information processing and fast response. Classical health insurance management system runs on a manually controlled centralized architecture which leverages a vulnerable single point failure and requires frequent human intervention. This makes the model prone to human errors and security attacks. The existing system also lacks the flexibility to choose appropriate health insurance policies for different consumers. To this end, we propose an Ethereum blockchain-based framework, ChainSure, to address this problem. With the power of TOPSIS and smart contracts, ChainSure provides an automated, tamperproof, transparent, scalable system that takes care of all the major functional blocks in a medical insurance environment. We have used the TOPSIS method in this proposed model to help the users to find an insurance policy that best suits their needs. ChainSure works in a decentralized environment and provides an interactive interface for the user. The proposed model is implemented on the Ethereum test network and its performance has been compared empirically with other state-of-art models. ChainSure is found to outperform others in terms of service integrity, latency and cost.},

	abstract = {The emission trading systems (ETSs) have encouraged the more usage of renewable energy, aiming for energy generation. However, the existing ETSs suffer from carbon credit scams, poor monitoring, verification and reporting (MRV), participants’ unwillingness and non-transparent trading. To address these issues, we propose a trustworthy and incentivized emission trading system using hyperledger (a permissioned blockchain) and smart contracts. It assures a transparent trading of carbon credits (CC) with better MRV. It applies three smart contracts viz; CC selling, CC buying and CC trading to achieve reliable and secure transactions of the energy trading with the improved trust. For emission trading, we propose a priority based auction, in which priority to CC sellers is assigned based on their carbon credits, while priority to CC buyers is assigned based on their reputation. This strategy rewards the participants for their efforts towards avoiding the deforestification and the use of renewable energy. In addition, it is incentivized for both CC buyers as well as sellers, and thus, it encourages more number of participants. The proposed system satisfies more than 84.37\% bids with minimum transaction latency (0.41 s) and sufficient throughput (102.42 tps). In addition, multi-criteria analysis using different statistical methods is performed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the proposed systems.},

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are a vital component of applications being built by blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Smart contracts consists of computer code that composed set of rules agreed upon by the involved parties. When these predefined conditions or rules are satisfied by the transactions initiated by parties, the smart contract executes itself to complete the transaction. Normally, while performing transactions with agreements involving multiple parties, a third party have to be involve to verify all the information, which makes it complex and time consuming process. Smart contracts simplify this process by eliminating the third party and automating the process, enabling the stakeholders to perform transactions directly with each other. Smart contract itself is replicated among multiple nodes of a blockchain there by giving benefits of immutability, security and permanence. Most smart contracts are written in Solidity programming language due to its simplicity and conciseness. Attackers are attracted by the popularity of Solidity language and its vulnerability possibilities. For example, in the 2016 year, 60 million US dollars was theft by Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack due to vulnerabilities present in smart contracts. There are few existing tools and papers on this area to find vulnerabilities on smart contracts but taking more time to predict. Thus, this paper presents different Deep learning techniques with satisfactory results to identify smart contract vulnerabilities which are Re-entrancy, Denial of Service (DOS) and Transaction Origin using binary, multi class and multi label classification techniques.},

On the other hand, Oracle provides a means to use an external execution environment for smart contracts, but its functional limitations and additional costs limit the growth of the DApp market to DApp users. To address the gas consumption crisis of DApps, we designed an event-based resource offloading solution that allows DApp developers to run their own compute servers. By adopting our solution, DApp users only pay the constant and minimized amount of gas fee, while the external server pays highly reduced amount of gas fee instead. We describe the solution in detail with a sample DApp model and mathematically demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution compared to an Oracle-based implementation. Furthermore, we conducted empirical experiment of actual DApp using EVM and verified the reduction of the gas consumption.},

Objective We aim at addressing the site availability issue on a hierarchical network by designing an immutable/transparent/source-verifiable quorum mechanism. Methods We developed an approach to combine a hierarchical learning algorithm, a novel Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) consensus protocol, and a design of blockchain smart contracts. We constructed QuorumChain as an example and evaluated the scenarios of site-unavailability during the initialization and/or iteration phases of the modeling process on three healthcare/genomic datasets. Results When one or more sites would become unavailable, HierarchicalChain could not function, whereas QuorumChain improved predictive correctness significantly (the full Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, or AUC, improved from 0.068 to 0.441, all with p-values {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion By constructing a quorum to continue the modeling process, QuorumChain possesses the capability to tackle the situation of sites being unavailable. It inherits the capability of learning on network-of-networks, improves learning continuity, and provides data/software immutability, transparency, and provenance, which can be important in expediting clinical research.},

	abstract = {Smart contract security has drawn extensive attention in recent years because of the enormous economic losses caused by vulnerabilities. Even worse, fixing bugs in a deployed smart contract is difficult, so developers must detect security vulnerabilities in a smart contract before deployment. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection efforts heavily rely on fixed rules defined by experts, which are inefficient and inflexible. To overcome the limitations of existing vulnerability detection approaches, we propose a GNN based approach for smart contract vulnerability detection. First, we construct a graph representation for a smart contract function with syntactic and semantic features by combining abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and program dependency graph (PDG). To further strengthen the presentation ability of our approach, we perform program slicing to normalize the graph and eliminate the redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities. Then, we use a Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural-Network model with hybrid attention pooling to identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contract functions. Empirical results show that our approach can achieve 89.2\% precision and 92.9\% recall in smart contract vulnerability detection on our dataset and reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

	abstract = {With the maturity of the blockchain technology, more and more blockchain digital currencies including the Bitcoin, the Ethereum and the Ripple have been developed. Meanwhile, the security problem of the blockchain digital currency has become increasingly serious. It is necessary to build a provenance model for a large number of blockchain transaction, which can be used to find out which link has trouble and who is responsible once a problem occurs. However, the existing blockchain transaction data analysis methods have low traceback accuracy for data provenance. Therefore, a novel blockchain transaction provenance model with graph attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. The graph attention mechanism is used to identify the traders. Then, a triplet data structure is built to record provenance information and express the relationship between transaction amount and traders. Finally, the smart contract is used to implement the proposed provenance model. The provenance information can be searched through the interface provided by the smart contract when the traceback is required. In addition, the real large-scale Bitcoin transaction dataset Elliptic is used to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. The experiment show that the proposed method achieves state of the art results of the traceback accuracy.},

	abstract = {We consider a newsvendor setting where the newsvendor elicits a demand forecast from an expert to determine the optimal inventory level for a product. Since the interests of both parties might not be aligned, we propose a proper scoring rule to elicit the expert's forecast that is tailored to the decision problem the newsvendor faces. Under the proposed scoring rule, both the newsvendor's expected profit and the expert's expected payment increase as the expert exerts a higher effort when gathering information to formulate a forecast. Trust issues arise in this setting because the ex post payment the expert receives is contingent on the accuracy of the reported forecast, which in turn depends on a future realized outcome that might be only available to the newsvendor. We show that coding the proposed proper scoring rule as a blockchain-based smart contract allows the newsvendor to signal trustworthiness while, at the same time, inducing the expert to devote more effort in information gathering. Following the design science research framework, we conclude the paper by suggesting a design and a fully functional prototype of a blockchain-based smart contract that implements the proposed tailored proper scoring rule.},

This paper demonstrates how a security vulnerability verification in a casino smart contract can be transformed to non-blocking verification. To this end, the contract is first modeled as interacting extended finite state machines (EFSM), with one EFSM for each function. Modeling the security vulnerability as a condition in the EFSM system, non-blocking verification reveals the system to be blocking. Investigating the counterexample produced by the verification shows that a transfer that is refused by its receiver may block the casino so that all remaining funds are forever locked into the contract, thus revealing a severe vulnerability. It is then demonstrated how the same technique can show the absence of this vulnerability, by verifying that the EFSM model of an improved casino contract is indeed non-blocking.},

This model aims to provide economic benefits to market players, ensure the safety and environmental protection of power grid operations, and integrate the ladder-type carbon emission trading mechanism. Then, it divides the electricity market into the electricity sales layer, i.e., active distribution networks (ADNs) and PV systems, and the electricity purchase layer, i.e., EVs. Smart contracts are signed with the agent layer, i.e., charging stations. The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the price and power of PV systems and EVs in the optimal contract, and the revenue of PV systems and EVs can be increased by over 35\%. Moreover, the orderly charging and discharging of EVs is coordinated with the characteristics of the daily power generation and evening load peaks of PV systems. The proposed model can effectively provide an optimal scheduling scheme for peak load shifting and valley filling while reducing the carbon emissions of ADNs.

Since the amount of EV is rising shapely, the EV charging demands is also rapidly generated. However, seeking suitable charging facilities is not easy for EV users, new energy companies run charging station separately for self-interests, and charging pile information is not transparent for drivers. This dilemma is not solved until the merging of blockchain technology. In this paper, a novel EV charging system is proposed for the cooperation of new energy companies and providing convenient charging services for users. In this system, charging information is managed and recorded by the company alliance based on consortium blockchain, which is tamper-resistant and multi-centralized. Meanwhile, a new smart contract is designed to balance the allocation of company’ charging users, so that the profits of different new energy companies could be fairer. To equilibrate the interest of companies and EV users, a Bio-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming model (BOMILP) is proposed as the mathematical logic of smart contracts. Furthermore, we proposed a new algorithm named Limited Neighborhood Search with Memory (LNSM) to support the implementation of smart contracts, which could make the smart contract running faster and has a better performance. At last, the proposed EV charging system and the smart contract are validated through a real case study with the EV charging data in Beijing, China.},

More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.},

	abstract = {With the commercialization of fifth generation mobile networks (5G) and continuous innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing, as a new emerging IoT application, has further deepened our knowledge, utilizing various smart objects distributed throughout the whole industrial system for data collection and processing. To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based crowdsensing model named CrowdLBM with a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed CrowdLBM outperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.},

	abstract = {Blockchains have been booming in recent years. As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give blockchains a user-defined logic. A smart contract is an executable program that can automatically carry out transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. However, some security issues in smart contracts are difficult to fix, and smart contracts also lack quality assessment standards. Therefore, this study proposes a Multiple-Objective Detection Neural Network (MODNN), a more scalable smart contract vulnerability detection tool. MODNN can validate 12 types of vulnerabilities, including 10 recognized threats, and identify more unknown types without the need for specialist or predefined knowledge through implicit features and Multi-Objective detection (MOD) algorithms. It supports the parallel detection of multiple vulnerabilities and has high scalability, eliminating the need to train separate models for each type of vulnerability and reducing significant time and labor costs. This paper also developed a data processing tool called Smart Contract-Crawler (SCC) to address the lack of smart contract vulnerability datasets. MODNN was evaluated using more than 18,000 smart contracts from Ethereum. Experiments showed that MODNN could achieve an average F1 Score of 94.8\%, the current highest compared to several standard machine learning (ML) classification models.},

In view of this, we propose an elliptic curve threshold signature scheme for blockchain (BC-ECTSS) to overcome the above issue.

Blockchain can provide technical solutions for trust issues between manufacturing service providers and demanders, but less research has focused on the stable maintenance of a blockchained shared manufacturing network (BSMN). Industrial knowledge graph and cognitive intelligence play an important role in designing incentive mechanisms for BSMN. Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper designs various incentive models and develops the corresponding smart contracts to encourage different enterprises to participate in the “accounting” operations, to enhance the trust and maintain the operational stability of BSMN. Firstly, the evolution mechanism of BSMN was analyzed. Then, an evolutionary game model between shared manufacturing enterprise nodes was established to deduce the stable state of BSMN. Based on the analysis of the evolutionarily stable state, an incentive model with three strategies to encourage different enterprise nodes to participate in “accounting” operations was determined, and smart contracts of the incentive models were developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive models was verified by simulation experiments.},

	abstract = {Regulatory changes in different countries regarding self-consumption and growing public concern about the environment are encouraging the establishment of community microgrids. These community microgrids integrate a large number of small-scale distributed energy resources and offers a solution to enhance power system reliability and resilience. This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles, mimicking the most typical layout of cities. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid, without requiring interaction with the distributed system operator. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.},

	abstract = {The language barrier is the biggest obstacle for users watching foreign-language videos. Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker's revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.},

However, most early warning systems are centralized and isolated, thus there are potential risks of single evidence bias and decision-making errors. In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organizations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality. It also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases.},

One of the main open problems in the analysis of Ethereum smart contracts is the inference of sound bounds on their gas consumption. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first static analysis that is able to infer sound parametric (i.e., non-constant) gas bounds for smart contracts. The inferred bounds can be parametric on the sizes of the input parameters for the functions, but also they can be parametric on the contract state, or blockchain data. Our gas analysis is developed at EVM bytecode level, in which Ethereum gas model is defined. Our analysis is implemented in a tool named Gastap, Gas-Aware Smart contracT Analysis Platform, which takes as input a smart contract and automatically infers sound gas upper-bounds for its public functions. Gastap has been applied over 318,093 functions fetched from the Ethereum blockchain, and succeeded to obtain gas bounds for 90.24\% of them.},

Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools do not provide mechanisms to cope with the flexibility requirements inherent to open and dynamic collaboration environments. In particular, existing tools adopt a static role binding approach wherein roles are bound to actors upfront when a process instance is created. Also, these tools do not allow participants to collectively make choices regarding alternative sub-processes or branches in the process model, at runtime. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. Furthermore, the paper introduces a model for consensus-based control-flow flexibility, wherein participants in a process can collectively agree on how to steer the business process within the boundaries defined by control-flow agreement policies. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles, control-flow elements, and policy constraints.},

Our study adopts mechanism design and design-driven activities, and specifically employs the Agents Events Data (AED) process mapping method, which is a hybrid approach that combines Business Process Redesign (BPR) and the Resources Events Assets (REA) accounting model. The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and “traditional” SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buy-side demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.},

	abstract = {An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.},

In this study, unlike the existing literature, a blockchain-based solution is developed for local cargo networks. With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts. In addition, shipments equipped with RFID tags are automatically tracked and traceable using UHF-RFID antennas. The IoT data collected in the study are stored on a cloud-based server, which is a cost-effective solution. Smart contracts that enable communication between the parties are written in the Solidity language using the Ganache, Truffle and Metamask platforms.

In addition, there are complex rights retrieval and assignment problems in the medical device supply chain system, and the traditional Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model is no longer suitable for the actual application environment of the supply chain. This article combines the traditional RBAC model and the Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) model for access control management in the medical device supply chain to overcome the limitations abovementioned, taking advantage of the ABAC model’s flexibility to achieve granular and dynamic management of permissions, as also the RBAC model to simplify the permissions management of the entire system. Blockchain technology’s traceability, non-tampering, and decentralization features are essential to eliminate passive and inferior medical equipment sales activities, solving the problem of mutual mistrust and ‘Information Silo’ between the two sides of medical device transactions. The access control model is implemented in the blockchain’s smart contract, providing granular and dynamic authority management for the medical equipment supply chain and guaranteeing the security and privacy of medical device information in the supply chain. Three smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric are designed for device management information, storage of implemented access control models, and implementation of access control policies. Experimental results show that the entire system is stable, ensuring high throughput and high security and promising.},

	abstract = {Energy policy is too often not designed for energy consumers in a low-cost and consumer-friendly manner. This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg game and Blockchain-based framework that enables consumer-centric decarbonization by automating iterative negotiations between policy makers and consumers or generators to reduce carbon emissions. This iterative negotiation is modeled as a Stackelberg game-theoretic problem, and securely facilitated by Blockchain technologies. The policy maker formulates carbon prices and monetary compensation rates to dynamically incentivize the carbon reduction, whereas consumers and generators schedule their power profiles to minimize bills and maximize profits of generation, respectively. The negotiating agreement is yielded by reaching a Stackelberg equilibrium. The exchanged information and controlling functions are realized by using smart contracts of Blockchain technologies. Case studies of GB power systems show that the proposed framework can incentivize 9\% more bill savings for consumers and 45.13\% more energy generation from renewable energy sources. As a consumer-centric decarbonization framework, it can at least reduce carbon emissions by 40\%.},

Cloud storage audit schemes can help data owner (DO) to confirm the integrity of their data, but the existing schemes still have some limitations. On one hand, the existing schemes assume that DO's terminal devices are computationally powerful enough to handle various operations in a timely manner. While in practice, the terminal devices probably are mobile phones, tablets and other devices with low computing power. On the other hand, the existing schemes rely on a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA), but it is not in line with real application scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit (BBPO-PA) scheme for low performance terminal devices. Firstly, we introduced a trusted proxy authorized by DO, which can process and upload DO's encrypted files. Secondly, we applied blockchain in our scheme and utilized smart contracts instead of untrusted TPA to improve the reliability and stability of audit results. Thirdly, we took advantage of an index table to ensure that our scheme can support dynamic data operation. Finally, security analysis revealed that our scheme is provably secure in random oracle model. Meanwhile, performance analysis demonstrated that our scheme is efficient and especially suitable for low performance terminal devices.},

To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market. The incentive for nodes outside the microgrid is removed but it is maintained for the prosumers within the microgrid. Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers’ income and consumers’ cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling. Successful mining is encouraged by rewards accordingly. A case study is introduced where a microgrid model with 27 prosumers is tested with the PoS public blockchain-based pricing scheme.

This paper proposes a new scheme that combines attribute-based access control (ABAC) model with blockchain technology and uses smart contracts for access control judgment. This scheme can realize dynamic, distributed and reliable access control in the open IoT environment. The IoT access control system based on this scheme consists of five functional modules. The information registration point registers information for each device that joins the system. Policy enforcement point (PEP) is responsible for managing agent-devices in the system and processing original access requests from access subjects. Policy decision point (PDP) makes access control right decision through smart contracts. Policy administration point (PAP) is used to manage smart contract information. Policy information point (PIP) is used to manage key attribute information of devices used for access control judgment. The scheme also includes three types of smart contracts, one management contract (MC) is used to manage other contracts in the system, one policy decision contract (PDC) is responsible for obtaining attribute information from PIP and making final access control right decision, and a large number of policy contracts (PCs) which composed of a public policy contract (PPC) and a large number of exclusive policy contracts (EPCs). These PCs are used to implement specific attribute-based access control policies. To demonstrate the application of the scheme, we simulated a scenario of access control in a home IoT environment and verified the feasibility of access control decisions using our proposed scheme through three experiments.},

In this context, composite smart contracts are used to represent collaborative business processes. A composite smart contract is a smart contract that needs to execute other contracts using external calls to achieve its tasks. Composite smart contracts, through the use of external calls and the execution of other smart contracts that might belong to other owners or companies, bring many challenges with regard to security requirements. As a result, special efforts must be done to ensure composite smart contracts security verification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to verify the security and the correctness of the composite smart contracts written in solidity in Ethereum blockchain. This approach is based on the finite state machine models and model checking method for modeling and verifying the composite smart contracts respectively. We consider seven security properties as well as the security issues that depend on the contract context to be checked in the composite smart contract. For this, we provide two different yet complementary types of verification. The first type of verification is applied to all smart contracts with properties called in our approach “standard properties” that represent the generic ones, while the second type considers the context-dependent properties that we called “specific properties” varying from one smart contract to another. Finally, we express all properties using computation tree logic formulae and we use the nuXmv symbolic model checker to verify the model against all properties. This approach is validated using a different set of solidity smart contracts.},

First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens building twin platform.

	abstract = {With the development of communication 5G networks and technologies, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce. The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided.},

	abstract = {We present models that utilize smart contracts and interledger mechanisms to provide decentralized authorization for constrained IoT devices. The models involve different tradeoffs in terms of cost, delay, complexity, and privacy, while exploiting key advantages of smart contracts and multiple blockchains that communicate with interledger mechanisms. These include immutably recording hashes of authorization information and policies in smart contracts, resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes, and cryptographically linking transactions and IoT events recorded on different blockchains using hash-lock and time-lock mechanisms. In the case of two ledgers, an authorization and a payment ledger, the authorization ledger can be a private Ethereum network or a permissioned ledger such as Hyperledger Fabric. For decentralized authorization where a subset of m-out-of-n authorization servers are required, we present two policies for selecting the m servers. The first policy can utilize statistics of the authorization servers such as transaction cost and response time. The second policy selects the first m servers that respond. The proposed models are evaluated on the public Ethereum testnets Rinkeby and Ropsten, and for different implementations on the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned ledger, in terms of execution cost (gas), delay, and reduction of data that needs to be sent to the constrained IoT devices.},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts are computer programs that are deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain to enforce agreements among untrusting parties. Being the most prominent platform that supports smart contracts, Ethereum has been targeted by many attacks and plagued by security incidents. Consequently, many smart contract vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past decade. To detect and prevent such vulnerabilities, different security analysis tools, including static and dynamic analysis tools, have been created, but their performance decreases drastically when codes to be analyzed are constantly being rewritten. In this paper, we propose Eth2Vec, a machine-learning-based static analysis tool that detects smart contract vulnerabilities. Eth2Vec maintains its robustness against code rewrites; i.e., it can detect vulnerabilities even in rewritten codes. Other machine-learning-based static analysis tools require features, which analysts create manually, as inputs. In contrast, Eth2Vec uses a neural network for language processing to automatically learn the features of vulnerable contracts. In doing so, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts by comparing the similarities between the codes of a target contract and those of the learned contracts. We performed experiments with existing open databases, such as Etherscan, and Eth2Vec was able to outperform a recent model based on support vector machine in terms of well-known metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and F1-score.},

A CD model based on extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) mechanism as well as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction, enable end-users to create efficient schemes for the continuous verification and validation of the execution of applications in edge–fog–cloud infrastructures. This scheme also verifies and validates established execution sequences and the integrity of digital assets. CV model converts ETL and DAG into business model, smart contracts in a private blockchain for the automatic and transparent registration of transactions performed by each application in workflows/pipelines created by CD model without altering applications nor edge–fog–cloud workflows. This model ensures that IoT dataflows delivers verifiable information for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes with certainty. A containerized parallelism model solves portability issues and reduces/compensates the overhead produced by CD/CV operations. We developed and implemented a prototype to create CD/CV schemes, which were evaluated in a case study where user mobility information is used to identify interest points, patterns, and maps. The experimental evaluation revealed the efficiency of CD/CV to register the transactions performed in IoT dataflows through edge–fog–cloud in a private blockchain network in comparison with state-of-art solutions.},

The commonly used decentralized bookkeeping mode, blockchain-based trading schemes can now realize uniform clearing of decentralized transactions with the help of smart contracts. However, there are still risks of excessive disclosure of information and privacy leakage caused by incomplete decentralization. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized optimization-based market clearing model, which can be applied on blockchain. The model has three advantages: ① limited access to the consumers’ or generators’ private data, ② convenient calculation methods that can be deployed on the smart contract and ③ pure decentralization to realize transparent on-chain market clearing. Moreover, considering the insufficient throughput of the existing blockchain, a blockchain network, which can process the quotation calculation in parallel with various sub-chains, is also designed to support the proposed market clearing model. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed models is validated and tested on the Ethereum private blockchain.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are self-executing programs running in the blockchain allowing for decentralised storage and execution without a middleman. On-chain execution is expensive, with miners charging fees for distributed execution according to a cost model defined in the protocol. In particular, transactions have a high fixed cost. We present MultiCall, a transaction-batching interpreter for Ethereum that reduces the cost of smart contract executions by gathering multiple users’ transactions into a batch. Our current implementation of MultiCall includes the following features: the ability to emulate Ethereum call and create transactions, both from MultiCall itself and using an identity unique to the user; the ability to cheaply pay ether to other MultiCall users; and the ability to authorise emulated transactions on behalf of multiple users in a single transaction using hash-based authorisation rather than more expensive signatures. This improves upon on a previous version of MultiCall. Our experiments show that MultiCall provides a saving between 57\% and 99\% of the fixed transaction cost compared with the standard approach of sending Ethereum transactions directly. Besides, we also show how to prevent an economic attack exploiting the metatransaction feature, describe a generic protocol for hash-based authorisation of metatransactions, and analyse how to minimise its off-chain computational and storage cost.},

	abstract = {Due to mobile Internet technology's rapid popularization, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can be seen everywhere in our daily lives. While IIoT brings us much convenience, a series of security and scalability issues related to permission operations rise to the surface during device communications. Hence, at present, a reliable and dynamic access control management system for IIoT is in urgent need. Up till now, numerous access control architectures have been proposed for IIoT. However, owing to centralized models and heterogeneous devices, security and scalability requirements still cannot be met. In this paper, we offer a smart contract token-based solution for decentralized access control in IIoT systems. Specifically, there are three smart contracts in our system, including the Token Issue Contract (TIC), User Register Contract (URC), and Manage Contract (MC). These three contracts collaboratively supervise and manage various events in IIoT environments. We also utilize the lightweight and post-quantum encryption algorithm-Nth-degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) to preserve user privacy during the registration process. Subsequently, to evaluate our proposed architecture's performance, we build a prototype platform that connects to the local blockchain. Finally, experiment results show that our scheme has achieved secure and dynamic access control for the IIoT system compared with related research.},

	abstract = {To make up the insufficient computing power of remote medical devices and solve the transmission delay problem, edge computing has been widely studied in academic community. The application of edge computing in E-health makes it more convenient for medical providers to view the patient’ electronic health records (EHRs), which not only improves the work efficiency of medical providers, but also provides patients with more personalized treatments. However,there are some security problems in the E-health system, such as EHRs leakage or tampering. Therefore, attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is widely used in the access control of EHRS. In order to reduce the computing cost of resource-constrained devices and achieve more flexible fine-grained access control, this paper proposes an effective ABE scheme that outsources part of the computing load to the fog nodes, which safely shares data with lower overheads. It also supports users revocation and attribute revocation. In addition, we combine smart contract and blockchain to share more fine-grained EHRs. The security proof and experimental results show that our scheme has higher efficiency to protect the patients’ EHRs privacy.},

	abstract = {A key component of blockchain technology is the ledger, viz., a database that, unlike standard databases, keeps in memory the complete history of past transactions as in a notarial archive for the benefit of any future test. In second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum, the ledger is coupled with smart contracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with agreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The coupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background for very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only focus of first generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin. However, the currently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming constructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited maliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We propose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by formalizing a notion of contract modeled as a finite-state automaton with well-defined computational characteristics derived from encoding in terms of allocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on programming. To complete the work, we use temporal logic as the basis for an abstract query language that is effectively suited to the historical nature of the information kept in the ledger.},

	abstract = {Genomic data repositories are rapidly growing due to the decline in the cost of DNA sequencing. This has increased the demand from stakeholders such as researchers to analyze these datasets to advance areas in biomedical research. Genomic datasets are mostly maintained by third-party direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic companies who operate a business model of collecting DNA data from their customers and selling them to pharmaceutical companies. This puts the privacy of their customers at risk since each individual’s human genome is unique. In addition, customers lose ownership of and access to their genomic data to DTCs and DTCs do not share profits from data sales with them. In this paper, we propose a system based on blockchain technology and homomorphic computation to address the aforementioned problems. We use blockchain transactions and smart contracts to allow genomic data owners (DOs) to have control of their data and sell access to it, and homomorphic computation with secure two-party protocol to enable genomic data users (DUs) to run queries to securely discover DOs of interest. We further optimize the query response time by proposing an approach based on genomic data partitions, binary search trees and bloom filters to reduce the search space. We also propose a blockchain penalty mechanism to encourage parties to behave honestly to avoid malicious behaviors such as uploading fake or non-human genomic data. We conduct our experiments on real genomic datasets and demonstrate that our proposed scheme allows DOs to control access to their data and is feasible and efficient in terms of computation cost, query response time and scalability.},

Due to the pursuit of diverging goals and mutual interdependencies, risks and trust problems between stakeholders occur. Contracts are used to govern these complex collaborations. To track compliance to contract terms, various activities are executed by involved stakeholders. These activities do not add any value to an end-product, cause intransparency, are costly and cause conflicts. Therefore, a combination of asset tracking and blockchain technology is investigated in this paper to address these problems. A plug-and-play framework of interacting applications and a workflow to operate them are proposed. Proof of this concept is provided by developing prototypical applications and by testing them in various practice-based scenarios. Simplified asset tracking throughout supply chains was realized and linked to smart contracts. This resulted in semi-automated compliance tracking and an immutable record of transactions. Therefore, this work provides more insight into combining asset tracking and blockchain for compliance checking in the construction industry. By doing so, further automation of construction processes, increased transparency between stakeholders and a reduction of conflicts can be enabled. However, it remains clear that many other variables impact on transparency and trust; and while technology can make improvements, considerable procedural security and control measures are needed in addition. Therefore, we focus on semi-automation of workflows using distributed ledger technology.},

	abstract = {India's grape farms face many climate risk events during cultivation and sustainability-related challenges during the export once the crop is harvested. So, to support the farmers, the Government of India (GoI) started promoting adaptive capacity resilient infrastructure. To further strengthen GoI initiatives, this paper proposes a novel Grapevoltaics farm inspired by Dynamic Agrivoltaics (DAgVs) concept based on the shared circular business model principles where resources like energy, water, and land are shared. The conceptual modeling and the rationale revealed that DAgVs' role in protecting the grape farms from natural disasters is prominent and tri-production of electricity, grapes, and water (from rainwater harvesting) is possible. However, the DAgVs effectiveness may be influenced by decisions taken by involved stakeholders (grape farmers and solar plant operators) related to resource sharing and support extension in the time of climate risk events raising questions about the resilience in the near term and the sustainability in the long term. So, to counter the resilience and sustainability challenges in grape farms, DAgVs are leveraged with blockchain smart contract technology making it blockchain-enabled Grapevoltaics (BCeDGVs); to understand the feasibility, integrated techno-economic and life cycle assessments are performed. As an illustrative case study, 1 ha of the grape farm is modeled, taking 12 grape-growing states in India as the study regions. The results showed that the solar panels provide resilience support based on the rules of engagement written on blockchain smart contracts. The BCeDGVs has 1295.28–2908.08 kWh/kWp/day solar electricity generation potential across India with a lifetime average of 15,380.65 MWh even after considering the national average photovoltaic degradation rate of 1.9\%. The observed grape yields varied between 2 and 31.25 Mt/ha with an average yield of 45 Mt/ha (table grape) and 40 Mt/ha (wine grape). The harvested rainwater across India varied between 1.23 and 7.32 Ml. The economic assessment revealed that grape farmers and solar photovoltaic plant operators across India under BCeDGVs could have revenues ranging between 56.25 and 225 MRs. and 29.48–66.19 MRs., respectively, suggesting to relook into the feed-in tariffs and crop selling prices given the digitalization scope. The environmental sustainability results suggest that 1.984 ha/MW land-use mitigation and 12–100\% reduction in groundwater dependency are possible while maintaining the minimum and maximum national average global warming potentials (GWPs) as 0.074 and 0.088 kg CO2eq./kg grape, respectively. Overall, the integrated assessments indicate that BCeDGVs reduce the agriculturally generated GWPs and other impacts while providing resilience support and opening a new research direction for symbiotic grape farms and energy networks.},

Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers’ reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task’s context on the worker’s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker’s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers’ predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers’ reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers’ QoI, and reputation change.},

Our approach proposes a semantically-different blockchain architecture, which introduces a new type of nodes whose purpose is to enhance the storage used by smart-contracts, alongside a highly efficient storage model combined with a hybrid compression mechanism. We then perform real-world experiments through our custom native blockchain and evaluate the performance impact of the approach, as well as the gains observed. We also assess an important advantage lying in backwards compatibility with major blockchains today.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of blockchain, the amount of smart contracts has increased very fast, and the safety of smart contracts has come to more extensive notice. Recently, machine learning technology has been widely applied in vulnerability detection for smart contracts. However, it implements effective smart contract vulnerability detection still faces a major challenge, that is, there is a problem of insufficient labeled data in the current field. Active learning can label data more efficiently. Nevertheless, classical active learning only uses limited labeled data for model training, contrary to the deep learning of a large amount of data required for model training. Because of the above, we provide a new framework, called ASSBert, that leverages active and semi-supervised bidirectional encoder representation from transformers network, which is dedicated to completing the task of smart contract vulnerability classification with a little amount of labeled code data and a large number of unlabeled code data. In our framework, active learning is responsible for selecting highly uncertain code data from unlabeled sol files and putting them into the training set after manual labeling. Besides, semi-supervised learning is charged to continuously pick a certain number of high-confidence unlabeled code data from unlabeled sol files, and put them into the training dataset behind pseudo-labeling. Intuitively, by combining active learning and semi-supervised learning, we are able to get more valuable data to increase the performance of our detection model. In our experiments, we collect our benchmark dataset included 6 vulnerabilities in about 20829 smart contracts. The result of the experiment demonstrates that our framework is superior to the baseline methods with a little amount of labeled code data and a large number of unlabeled code data.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing reliance on loot boxes by the video game industry has attracted scrutiny from consumer groups and regulators. For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.},

	abstract = {The rationality and scientific nature of the emission trading mechanism is the key to the effective implementation of environmental and economic policies. As far as China is concerned, there are phenomena such as information asymmetry, low supervision efficiency, and alienation of government and enterprise behaviors caused by the incomplete mechanism of emission trading in the practice of different pilots. The introduction of blockchain technology can innovate the traditional transaction model and form a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction and a trusted emission trading market. To this end, based on the current emission trading mechanism and the characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper couples the core technologies of blockchain with the functional requirements of application scenarios. Then, an innovative application framework is built based on the consortium blockchain Fabric from three aspects: emission trading supervision, secondary trading market construction, as well as emission trading incentive and punishment mechanisms. Technologies such as the consensus mechanism, smart contract, Merkle tree and asymmetric encryption are comprehensively applied in this process. In the construction of the blockchain framework of the secondary market for emission trading, institutional changes and innovations brought about by the blockchain at various levels are analyzed in terms of participants, transaction processes and the transaction scope. At the same time, smart contract functions and algorithms are designed for the purchase, transfer-out and trading of emission rights, and the operation business logic of the smart contract is analyzed. On the whole, this paper explores the application framework of blockchain technology in the field of emission trading at the macro level, and analyzes the application mechanism of the corresponding technologies of blockchain at each coupling point in the framework at the micro level. The collaborative analysis at the two levels shows that blockchain technology and the requirements of emission trading mechanism can be effectively coupled, and the application of blockchain technology can promote the effective supervision of enterprises' emission behavior, making the processes of the purchase, transfer and transaction of emission rights intelligent and automated, and providing technical support for cross-regional emission trading to reduce transaction costs and management complexity. In addition, the issuance of emission credits based on smart contract will be a new incentive for companies to actively participate in transactions. Based on the above analysis, this paper believes that the innovative application of blockchain technology is of great significance in the promotion of the market-based allocation of element of emission trading and the rational allocation of environmental resources. It will lead to a major breakthrough in the traditional trading system in terms of trading modes, forming a value transmission network of environmental resources between the government and polluters.},

	abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties involved, which often leads to “adversarial relationships”, “risk avoidance”, and a “lack of trust” among the different actors. This culture is further compounded by a “linear workflow” that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration.},

We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract = {Context: Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, we present our second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7\% lucid and 72.2\% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3\% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping. Conclusion: iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.},

In this paper, exchange of highly sensitive information in a more transparent and secure way and to avoid the misunderstandings and trust issues between the enterprises a smart contractbased on blockchain technology has been proposed in case of a distributed manufacturingenvironment. Here, we used a public-permission less Ethereum platform to execute the smart contracts in the Blockchain to process the customer orders and to identify the right enterprise. Later, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimal resource sharing and scheduling in a considered sustainable DMS. The objectives of the proposed model consist of simultaneously improvement of the performance measures such as makespan, machine utilization, energy consumption, and reliability. To solve this MILP model, a new Multi-objective-based Hybridized Moth Flame Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HMFEO) is developed and then the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The results obtained from implementing the model using experimental data along with different cases show the efficiency and the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. Moreover, several performance indicators like hyper volume are increased by nearly 15–20 \% that shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm with the NSGA-III.},

In our proposed architectural framework solution, we identify two types of actors: authorized and unauthorized, to limit and control access to the citizens' personal information. Besides, to preserve individuals' privacy, we adopt on-chain and off-chain storage (Interplanetary File Systems IPFS). In our case, smart contracts improve security and privacy in the health passport verification process. Our system implementation describes the proposed solution to grant individual privacy.

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps.},

	abstract = {Context. As self-executing programs on blockchain platforms, smart contracts can build a trusted environment between multi-parties. However, participants who lack programming knowledge usually have difficulties understanding smart contracts by reading the source code. It brings them difficulties and risks when interacting with decentralized applications. Objective. We aim to translate the smart contract source code into natural language descriptions as fine-grained in-line comments to help people better understand, learn and operate smart contracts. Method. We propose an automated translation approach for smart contracts written in Solidity, termed SolcTrans, based on an Syntax Tree (AST) and formal grammar. We have investigated representative Solidity smart contracts, identified the AST parsing paths and core attributes used for translation, and proposed corresponding translation templates for special statements. Then, we leveraged reinforcement learning to train a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar-based syntax synthesizer used to generate comprehensible English sentences as comments. Result. The experimental results show that SolcTrans outperforms four state-of-the-art neural machine translation models under currently available training data and is less affected by lengths of code snippets and translation outputs. We also conducted a human evaluation among 20 volunteers and asked them to score the generated comments. The results demonstrate that SolcTrans performs well on three metrics: Accuracy, Readability, and Instructiveness. Conclusion. Our approach produces high-quality fine-grained comments for smart contract source code under the small training dataset, which creates a paradigm for future studies.},

A flexible authorization model with strict access control policies is promising for electronic health record (EHR) sharing with security. In this paper, a blockchain-based multi-hop permission delegation scheme with controllable delegation depth for EHR sharing has been presented. We use the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for storing the original EHRs. Smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology are implemented for permission delegation. In order to ensure data security, we use attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control. Additionally, blockchain is used to achieve traceability and immutability. We deploy smart contracts so that the delegation depth can be set by delegators. Security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that our solution meets the designed goals. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm and implement the scheme on the Ethereum test chain. Our scheme outperforms the competition in terms of performance, according to the results of our experiments.},

The retailer determines the optimal quantity to purchase and the selling price. The supply chain can be managed through either a traditional online platform or a blockchain. In the former, firms face business risks due to delivery and service and also pay high transaction costs. In the latter, they work on a blockchain platform, remove all risks over the supply chain, and save the transaction costs. However, the blockchain requires initial implementation investments as well as variable costs. Furthermore, the firms gain in terms of visibility, transparency, and security, which are summarized in tokens. We identify the conditions and the stochastic cases in which the blockchain is not worth implementing. Then, we investigate the suitability of a smart wholesale price contract and a smart revenue sharing contract to better coordinate firms’ relationships and negotiations. We highlight all cases in which the use of smart contracts makes blockchain applications more operationally convenient and economically appealing.},

Ethereum is currently the largest platform for smart contracts, and anomaly detection is imminent. However, the data related to smart contracts is huge and contains complex objects and relationships. It is impossible to extract high-order attributes and low efficiency using traditional methods. The key to reduce fraud is extracting features from complex smart contracts and effectively identifying abnormal contracts. Therefore, this paper constructs a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Networks (S\_HGTNs) suitable for smart contract anomaly detection to detect financial fraud on the Ethereum platform. For feature representation, this paper first extracts the features to construct a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) for smart contract, and uses the relationship matrix obtained from the meta-path learned in the transformer network as the input of the convolution network, and finally uses the node embedding for classification tasks. The classification results show that this model performs better than the traditional model and the standard deviation is small, which proves the effectiveness and stability of the model.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts struggle with the major limitation of operating on data that is solely residing on the blockchain network. The need of recruiting third parties, known as oracles, to assist smart contracts has been recognized with the emergence of blockchain technology. Oracles could be deviant and commit ill-intentioned behaviors, or be selfish and hide their actual available resources to gain optimal profit. Current research proposals employ oracles as trusted entities with no robust assessment mechanism, which entails a risk of turning them into centralized points of failure. The need for an effective method to select the most economical and rewarding oracles that are self-interested and act independently is somehow neglected. Thus, this paper proposes a Bayesian Bandit Learning Oracles Reliability (BLOR) mechanism to identify trustless and cost-efficient oracles. Within BLOR, we learn the behavior of oracles by formulating a Bayesian cost-dependent reputation model and utilize reinforcement learning (knowledge gradient algorithm) to guide the learning process. BLOR enables all the blockchain validators to verify the obtained results while running the algorithm at the same time by dealing with the randomness issue within the limited blockchain structure. We implement and experiment with BLOR using Python and the Solidity language on Ethereum. BLOR is benchmarked against several models where it proved to be highly efficient in selecting the most reliable and economical oracles with a fair balance.},

Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business processes can be seen as smart contracts, as they are oftentimes adopted to express agreements among different organizations. Indeed, they provide mechanisms to formalize the obligations of each involved party. For instance, collaborative business processes can specify when a certain task should be executed, under which conditions a service should be offered to the other participants, and how physical objects and information should be manipulated. In this setting, to prevent misuse of smart contracts and services and information provided, it is paramount to guarantee by design that security requirements are fulfilled. With the rise in popularity of blockchains, several approaches exploiting the trusted smart contract execution environment offered by this technology to enforce collaborative business processes have been proposed. Yet, the complexity of business processes, security requirements, and blockchain applications calls for an engineering approach that guides the design of secure business processes. Such an approach should both take advantage of the possibilities offered by blockchain technology to enforce some security requirements (e.g., non-repudiation), and take into account the limitations blockchain poses for other security requirements (e.g., confidentiality). However, we are not aware of any existing work that aims at addressing such issues following a similar approach. In this article, we propose SecBPMN2BC: a model-driven approach to designing business processes with security requirements that are meant to be deployed on blockchains. SecBPMN2BC consists of: (i) an extension of BPMN 2.0 that allows designing secure smart contracts; (ii) a set of algorithms and their implementation that check incompatible security requirements and help the design of smart contracts; (iii) a workflow that guides the application of the method. The method has been validated with a survey conducted on security and BPMN experts.},

	abstract = {The development of 5G technology provides huge potential for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the IoV scenario, the secure exchange of traffic warning data is necessary to guarantee the safety of pedestrians, vehicles, and public transport facilities. However, there remain a series of challenging issues to achieve data secure sharing while ensuring efficiency. Current solutions such as the data outsourcing storage of traditional centralized cloud servers may cause information leakage due to their incomplete credibility. To address these problems mentioned above, this paper proposes an edge-aided searchable data sharing scheme based on blockchain for IoV in a 5G environment. First, the proposed scheme stores the search index of the keyword and the hash value of the data ciphertext on the blockchain to ensure its integrity and authenticity, and the smart contract automatically verifies the search trapdoor. And then, an edge caching mechanism is designed to quickly feedback on users’ retrieval needs based on a cloud-edge collaboration model. In addition, attribute-based searchable encryption is used to ensure that only the users who meet the access attributes and policy can decrypt the encrypted traffic warning data, which can achieve fine-grained access control and keyword search simultaneously. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our scheme is secure and more efficient compared with other schemes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9\% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15\%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50\% in scenarios including grid constraints.},

	abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing, outsourcing a computation has become a common practice. A client, to have greater confidence in computations performed by the cloud, should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. Two approaches are followed to verify the correctness of the results: (1) Proof-based verifiable computing and (2) Replication-based Verifiable Computing. The first approach uses cryptography techniques, whereas the second approach follows game-theoretic methods. Although both approaches are almost perfect solutions to verify the results, they do not discuss fairness in verifiable computing. In this paper, we consider the problem of fairness in verifiable cloud computing, which means that the cloud gets the payment from a client for an outsourced computation if and only if the client receives the correct output of the computation. Most of the existing solutions rely on a trusted third-party to realise fairness. Motivated by the recent advances in blockchain technology and smart contracts, we propose protocols for different verifiable computing techniques using smart contracts. We first present a smart-contract based solution for fair proof-based verifiable computation and show that the overhead of using smart-contract is almost negligible when both client and cloud are honest. Then we show two different solutions depending upon the number of clouds hired to achieve fairness in replication-based verifiable computing. We have designed our protocols in the Blockchain model of cryptography and proved their security under universally composable theory. We also show the financial and transactional cost analysis of proposed contracts by implementing them in solidity and running them on Ethereum Blockchain.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts.},

The matter gets more complicated when a number of devices collaborate to launch a colluding attack (e.g., Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS)) in a network (e.g., Smart home). To handle these attacks, most studies have hitherto proposed authentication protocols that cannot necessarily be implemented in devices, especially during Device-to-Device (D2D) interactions. Tapping into the potential of Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, this work proposes a lightweight authentication mechanism that enables safe D2D interactions in a smart home. The Ethereum blockchain enables the implementation of a decentralized prototype as well as a peer-to-peer distributed ledger system. The work also uses a single server queuing system model and the authentication mechanism to curtail DDoS attacks by controlling the number of service requests in the system. The simulation was conducted twenty times, each with varying number of devices chosen at random (ranging from 1 to 30). Each requester device sends an arbitrary request with a unique resource requirement at a time. This is done to measure the system's consistency across a variety of device capabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol not only prevents colluding attacks, but also outperforms the benchmark protocols in terms of computational cost, message processing, and response times.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things devices generates a huge amount of sensitive data. Machine learning is the standard processing paradigm for intelligently handling the huge amount of data. Unfortunately, the IoT devices have limited resources to handle the performance of big data feature learning with machine learning techniques. IoT devices often compromise the privacy of users and make them vulnerable to numerous cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication protocol based on blockchain technology and the secret computational model of physically unclonable function (denoted by PUF model). The proposed protocol guarantees the users privacy with a decentralized smart contract blockchain with the PUF model. In practice, the proposed protocol guarantees that IoT devices and the miner are authenticated in a faster authentication process compared to current blockchain techniques. In addition, Blockchain and PUF combine to ensure data provenance and data transparency in IoT networks. Blockchain-based smart contracts provide decentralized digital ledgers that are able to withstand data tampering attacks. This ensures the security and privacy of outsourced big data in IoT environments. We also investigated the privacy implications of using IoT devices with various security analysis, and avenues for research to extenuate the privacy concerns in IoT environments.},

	abstract = {Rapid printed circuit boards (PCB) prototyping refers to the pilot production of PCB before mass production for verifying the circuit design. The rapid PCB prototyping service providers are pursuing the mass individualization paradigm. Yet, these providers suffer from low efficiency and high cost in the large-scale small-batched mixed pilot production of rapid PCB prototyping. To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework. A blockchained smart contracts-driven multi-agent system is established at the edge to realize efficient tasks coordination under disturbances. Based on the operation events data and control decisions collected at the edge, a customized deep learning-driven prediction model is established at the cloud for supporting the rescheduling decisions. The blockchained smart contracts (e.g., Stackelberg game solution) at the edge proactively decentralize short-term fine-grained individualized task execution among manufacturing units/machines and make the results available on upper-level deep learning model at the cloud for supporting holistic rescheduling decisions. The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization. Through a simulated case based on data collected from a rapid PCB prototyping service provider in China, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed CEO-BAPC framework are verified.},

	abstract = {Programming errors in Ethereum smart contracts can result in catastrophic financial losses from stolen cryptocurrency. While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation. However, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation, which is nevertheless applicable for practical use.},

Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model’s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.},

However, companies worry that the business information is leaked in the process of horizontal cooperation. This kind of mistrust often leads to the failure of horizontal cooperation. The emergence of blockchain technology has become a great means to resolve trust problem between partners, which ensures data sharing and trust through peer-to-peer, consensus mechanism and encryption technology. In response, this study proposes architecture of blockchain-based urban distribution system for horizontal cooperation that analyzes the components and layers of the urban distribution. Meanwhile, a smart contract, the innovative applications of blockchain, is designed to match the resource of supply and demand to design the distribution routes in the urban distribution system. To achieve the above goal, an open vehicle routing model of urban distribution taking into account environmental pollution factors is developed as the mathematical logic of smart contract, which aims at the lowest total cost including fixed, fuel, penalty, carbon emission and pollutant emission costs. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm is developed to support the implementation of smart contract, and the effectiveness of the smart contract is verified through a real case. This study narrows the knowledge gap in applying blockchain technology to urban distribution, and has brought contributions to the fields of blockchain and urban distribution. Finally, the limitation and future research direction are discussed.},

	abstract = {Blockchain provides a decentralized environment for applications and information systems in various fields. It is an innovative revolution for the traditional Internet. However, without proper regulatory mechanisms, the blockchain technology has gradually become a hotbed of criminal activities, such as Ponzi scheme that brings huge economic losses to people. To maintain the security of the blockchain system, the machine learning technique, which can detect smart Ponzi schemes automatically has recently received extensive attention. However, the existing method has potential target leakage and prediction shift problems when dealing with category features and calculating gradient estimates. Besides, they also ignore the imbalance and repeatability of smart contracts, which often causes the model to overfit. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for detecting smart Ponzi schemes in blockchain. Specifically, we first expand the dataset of smart Ponzi schemes and eliminate the unbalanced dataset via data enhancement. Then, we leverage ordered target statistics (TS) to handle the category features of smart contract without target leakage. Finally, we propose an anti-leakage smart Ponzi schemes detection (Al-SPSD) model based on the idea of ordered boosting. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the competitive methods and is effective and reliable in detecting smart Ponzi schemes. Al-SPSD achieves 96\% F-score and detects about 1,621 active smart Ponzi schemes in Ethereum.},

Traditionally, conformance checking has been performed centrally by a trusted entity, however that may not be applicable in the case of collaborative processes between multiple organizations. Consortium Blockchain has been adopted to overcome the need for a trusted entity and foster transparency, accountability, and workflow. Existing blockchain-based conformance checking frameworks focus on translating BPMN models into smart contracts, however they do not support complex BPMN constructs, which limits their applicability in real-life collaborations. In this paper, distributed, multi-perspective conformance checking framework is proposed. This framework supports complex BPMN constructs such as Timers or Boundary processes running on a Consortium blockchain. The proposed framework includes: (1) A process to extract Process Conformance Rules from BPMN models, and (2) A blockchain-based technique to perform checking of the extracted rules to determine process conformance. Furthermore, it can be used by businesses in both after-the-fact checking or during process execution in a transparent and trusted manner. Evaluation of the framework implemented over Quorum conducted with real-life logs proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detecting various violation types in a traceable and transparent manner.},

	abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health \& safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V\&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V\&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).},

In turn, final customers constantly seek to lower costs whilst maximising quality and reliability. This paper proposes a decentralised business model for multi-service networks using Ethereum blockchain features – gas, transactions, and smart contracts – to execute multiple services at different prices. By employing the Ethereum cryptocurrency token, Ether, to quantify the quality of service and reliability of distinct private Ethereum networks, our model concurrently processes streams of services at different gas prices while differentially delivering reliability and service quality. This multi-service business model has been extensively tested on five concurrent Ethereum networks with various combinations of gas prices, miners, and regular nodes using a Proof of Authority consensus algorithm and throughput as the evaluation metric. It has exhibited linear scalability, providing increased throughput in high-quality Ethereum networks, i.e., composed of more validator nodes. The results also indicate that different mining prices do not impact the network performance, but networks with more miners had limited scalability and an increased level of trustworthiness and reliability.},

	abstract = {The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.},

	abstract = {Industrial applications often require federated cloud services from multiple providers to improve reliability and flexibility. Traditional selection methods through auctions usually involve a centralized auctioneer to coordinate the auction procedure. Blockchain and smart contracts provide a decentralized mechanism to automate the cloud auction process; however, existing solutions fail in the selection of the most suitable providers and the violation detection of the signed auction agreements, which are also known as service-level agreements (SLAs). To tackle these problems, we propose an integrated auction model using Bayesian game theory and blockchain techniques. The proposed model is enhanced with two Bayesian Nash Equilibriums (BNEs); the first BNE enables the selection of cost-effective providers to construct the federated cloud services, while the second BNE ensures consistent and trustworthy monitoring of federated SLAs. Moreover, a timed message submission (TMS) algorithm is proposed to protect the auction privacy during the message submission phase.

	abstract = {In the supply chain ecosystem, trust among transacting parties is a critical component to ensure profitability. However, participating parties act selfishly in their interest resulting in a sub-optimal output for transactions. This makes it difficult for trust to be established and an effective equilibrium to be reached among parties. Therefore, it is essential to ensure coordination among all parties and for all parties to collaborate effectively to avoid this problem. This helps to create a favourable environment and ensures profitability on the supply chain. Previous works have attempted to achieve this by making use of contracting mechanisms to regulate IoT devices and nodes on the network. In these systems, parties are enticed to act in a way so that profit achieved in the supply chain is maximized. However, these contracting mechanisms utilized are centralized and can easily be compromised. Also, these contracts are not enforced by a framework that ensures the effective establishment of trust among parties on the supply chain. Also, equilibrium remains in-established due to the complexity and lack of an effective system to regulate behaviour effectively. In this work, we design a blockchain-adaptive framework that incentivizes participants to work together on the supply chain to establish an equilibrium. We show through a proof of Concept, that the blockchain possesses the necessary attributes needed in establishing a Nash Equilibrium and can be used to coordinate the supply chain in complex scenarios to ensure security, trust, and profit. Using game theory models, we develop novel approaches and prove mathematically that the blockchain is more efficient in establishing a supply chain equilibrium among parties, ensuring fairness among various parties. Additionally, we utilize smart contracts to calculate each participating party’s expected payoff and profit. We also attempt to reduce the level of uncertainties across the supply chain by presenting profit-maximizing parties. Here the transparency provided by the blockchain provides a means to collate information relevant for making effective decisions on the blockchain which proves relevant in multi-complex supply chain networks such as aircraft, and vehicle manufacturing and assembling networks. Here, parties are thus incentivized to make the right decisions. We observe through our test that the blockchain provides all parties with the best payoff that satisfies all parties by incorporating each individual’s decisions on the supply chain, ensuring trust and equilibrium are established. The implementation of our work was achieved using standard blockchain networks. Our results show the cost-efficiency and feasibility of our proposed idea.},

Their management is decentralized without top executive teams and built on automated rules encoded in smart contracts, and their governance works autonomously based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms that support community decision-making. A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building. Our contribution provides conceptual clarity and proposes a framework for future research directions.},

	abstract = {With the advent of mobile crowdsensing, the mobile devices equipped with a variety of sensors (such as accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone etc.) are used to collect sensory data. A data aggregator processes the collected sensor data to deliver various services such as traffic management, health care and environmental monitoring. To ensure the privacy of the data, privacy-preserving aggregation (PPA) has attracted much attention since it can find aggregated statistics on the encrypted data. In this paper, we extend the existing PPA schemes in two directions: (1) Aggregator unforgeability – The aggregator performs the aggregation operation correctly. Although there are some schemes which consider aggregator unforgeability, they rely on cryptographic techniques. (2) Fair payments – The data owners receive the payments for their data contribution if and only if the aggregator receives the data. Contrary to existing works, we achieve the aggregator unforgeability and fair payments by modeling the aggregator as a smart contract running on a public Blockchain network. We design two PPA schemes FairNaivePPA and FairPPA for secure aggregation of MCS data with fair payments. We show the financial and transactional cost analysis of proposed contracts by implementing them in solidity and running them on Ethereum Blockchain.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has revolutionized the ways of processing and storing data in terms of reliability and security. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in transferring the processing hurdle from the client–server to a decentralized and secured platform. Blockchain is deemed to be an efficient technology in a forthcoming era that would beneficiate multifarious industries. An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5\%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5\%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.},

Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done.

We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource “scarcity” and on the environment.},

Such data sets should arguably ensure end-to-end traceability and data integrity in order to release a medicine batch, which is uniquely identified and tracked by its batch number/code. Consequently, auditable computerised systems are crucial on pharmaceutical production lines, since the industry is becoming increasingly regulated for product quality and patient health purposes. This paper describes the EU-funded SPuMoNI project, which aims to ensure the quality of large amounts of data produced by computerised production systems in representative pharmaceutical environments. Our initial results include significant progress in: (i) end-to-end verification taking advantage of blockchain properties and smart contracts to ensure data authenticity, transparency, and immutability; (ii) data quality assessment models to identify data behavioural patterns that can violate industry practices and/or international regulations; and (iii) intelligent agents to collect and manipulate data as well as perform smart decisions. By analysing multiple sensors in medicine production lines, manufacturing work centres, and quality control laboratories, our approach has been initially evaluated using representative industry-grade pharmaceutical manufacturing data sets generated at an IT environment with regulated processes inspected by regulatory and government agencies.},

Many existing strategies to strengthen the resilience of supply chains are facilitated by the use of digital technology. Blockchain, as one of the promising innovative technologies, enables a transparent, secure, and timely data exchange and automation via smart contracts. In this paper, we discuss the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain risk management and, in particular, on supply chain resilience. We identify potential risk-related blockchain application scenarios and examine their impact on the existing resilience strategies. We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient. From our investigations, we derive insights for managers who are interested in practical implementation.},

The literature shows that to relax the pressure on the last mile sector, blockchain technology can be an effective solution both to protect the firm financial aspects and sustainability requirements. To ensure efficiency in the system and success in the implementation of blockchain technology into the last mile delivery sector, it is essential to study the various factors and capabilities of blockchain to handle the existing problems and requirements to analyze the efficiency of this integration. The focus areas of this paper are mainly to identify the impact of applying blockchain technology to support the last mile delivery of goods. The impacted areas focus mainly on the efficiency of the process and its leverage on the costs, both administrative and operational, and level of sustainability achieved. The proposed platform has enabled the enhancement of the integration of blockchain into the last mile delivery. The proposed smart contract system is designed to efficiently assign the orders from the demander to the respective fleet providers with the help of miners.

	abstract = {Traceability has become a critical element in supply chain management, particularly in safety-sensitive sectors like food, pharmaceuticals, etc. Upstream (manufacturers, producers, etc.) and downstream (distributors, wholesalers, etc.) supply chain members need to store and handle traceability-related information for providing proof of regulatory compliance to both state authorities and more demanding customers. More specifically, European Union regulations mandate food producers to trace all raw materials/ingredients used throughout their supply chain operations. Consumers also place high expectations on food supply chains (FSC) with specific emphasis on facets related to safety. However, the complexity of modern FSC networks and their fragmentation act as barriers for the development of sound traceability mechanisms. This paper aims to develop a distributed functional model to provide decentralized and automated FSC traceability based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. For assessing the feasibility of the proposed modeling approach, a food traceability use-case scenario is presented. The applicability of the model is further illustrated by the development of a fully functional smart contract and a local private blockchain. The overall benefits of the proposed model are assessed based on a set of predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The results are of significant value to both practitioners and researchers.},

To this end, blockchain is an emerging distributive technology that guarantees data authenticity and integrity by providing decentralized, immutable, and traceable data storage. However, directly integrating BIM with blockchain risks leaking sensitive data, since a blockchain is a transparent network insofar as shared information (including sensitive data) can be disclosed to all members without access control. Therefore, this paper proposes a confidentiality-minded framework (CMF) for blockchain-based design collaboration. The major innovations are twofold. First, an access control model is developed in the CMF to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive BIM data in a blockchain ledger. Second, new design strategies are developed in CMF to facilitate design coordination within the access-controlled blockchain network. An illustrative design example validates the feasibility and performance of the proposed CMF, which has acceptable latency and storage cost. The results also show that the sensitive BIM data are effectively kept confidential when project members collaborate within the CMF.},

The integration of blockchain technology in farming is gaining attention for its potential to migrate from the centralized and monopolistic model that shapes today’s food value chain. This paper highlights the fact that most of today’s blockchain-based farming frameworks focus on food tracking and traceability. Only rarely does research focus on the design of digital marketplaces to support the trading of agricultural goods between farmers and potentially interested third party stakeholders; equally rarely are performance evaluations performed for the proposed frameworks. The latter is where this paper contributes the most by, not only proposing a novel blockchain-based farming marketplace platform (called “FarMarketplace”), but also a comprehensive methodology to help software solution integrators to better understand and measure how a given configuration setting of such a platform can influence the overall quality of service performance in the long run.},

Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.},

	abstract = {VANETS (IoVs), banks, and healthcare records are the sensitive information of vehicles, clients, and patients that is stored and maintained electronically, which has historically been a popular target for privacy leakage. To address growing issues about privacy leakage in these scenarios, federated learning has been frequently accepted as a privacy-preserving framework that enables multiple users to collectively develop a global model. To preserve the privacy of the training data, the server and participants share only model parameters. However, since participants have access to modified model parameters, this solution is still prone to poisoning and label-flipping attacks. Recent research showed that the federated learning framework is highly susceptible to attacks, with poisoning and label flipping being the most powerful, as well as secluded attacks, in which attackers can poison the parameters of the global model to gain access to the clients’ confidential information or degrade the global model’s performance. To address these attacks, a decentralized framework for securing the global models in federated learning (SecurePrivChain) is proposed in this study. A permissioned private Ethereum blockchain and encryption mechanisms were adopted in the framework to hide global parameters and preserve the privacy of a client’s data as well as achieve client’s authentication. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using metrics such as computed cost, transaction latency, loss, and cost analysis based on Ethereum gas consumption. The performance of the scheme was compared with other benchmark models which are based on different encryption mechanisms. These included RSA and algamal using publicly available MNIST, banks, vehicles, and hospital datasets. Numerical results show that the proposed framework has good performance. A formal security analysis is done to show how the system can meet its goal of protecting privacy.},

	abstract = {The desire of prosumers to participate in the markets has led to the setting up of Decentralized Local Electricity Markets (DLEM). These markets are usually confined to a small geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Such markets have very low liquidity for participants to trade, so price discovery becomes a cumbersome process. To solve the issue of market liquidity, this paper introduces a DLEM model where market participants can trade with a Liquidity Pool (LP) created by Energy Storage Units (ESU). The market model provides iteration-free price discovery by using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol, which automatically updates energy price in the LP based on demand–supply balance. The efficiency of AMM is further improved using the concept of concentrated liquidity by restricting the trading range. A network loss compensation method is applied to ensure DLEM transactions do not affect the power contracts already committed. Simulation studies are conducted on IEEE 33 bus and 123 bus distribution networks for various energy demand scenarios to show operation of the proposed market model.},

As the next generation of core technology after the Internet, blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods. Meanwhile, the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems. The main objective of this study is to develop a “vaccine blockchain” system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies. This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines.},

	abstract = {The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the cloud posed technical challenges for the design of compliance solutions. In particular, the accountability principle in the GDPR requires cloud providers to demonstrate their compliance, which implies that a GDPR compliance solution should maintain tamper-proof evidence for the massive data processing activities in cloud services. Additionally, the transparency of a compliance solution is essential for improving the trust of cloud users. Most of the existing solutions implemented their compliance logic as smart contracts on a blockchain to utilize its immutable transaction history for accountability and to gain user trust through its transparency. However, this widely adopted pattern in the solutions imposed the throughput constraint of blockchains on the implementation of compliance logic. In order to address this, we first conduct a requirement analysis of the GDPR accountability principle. After the analysis, we introduce a domain model of the principle and propose a modularized architecture to support the accountability in the cloud. Then, we present a prototype implementation of the architecture, in which a blockchain-based technique is used to provide immutability and data integrity for event records (e.g., data processing activities of cloud providers), while the compliance logic is not affected by the overhead of blockchains. Finally, we evaluate the prototype using benchmarks and analyses to investigate the throughput, resource consumption, and scalability of the architecture.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are becoming increasingly popular in the last years. They collect reviews concerning several types of items (e.g., shops, professionals, services, songs or videos) in order to rank them according to a given criterion, and to suggest the most relevant ones to their users. However, most of the currently used RSs exhibit two main drawbacks: they are based on a centralized control model and they do not provide reward mechanisms to encourage the participation of users. To deal with these challenges, the architectures of current RSs could be enhanced through blockchain technology, thus providing novel solutions to decentralize them. As a matter of fact, the blockchain technology could be successfully adopted in this context because smart contracts would allow the decentralization of system control, while cryptocurrency and tokens could be used to implement the reward mechanism. In the light of the above considerations, this manuscript presents a decentralized rating framework aimed to support the users of RSs based on blockchain technology, providing a token-based reward mechanism that remunerates users submitting their reviews to incentivize their participation. Moreover, the proposed system provides a flexible strategy to rank items, allowing users to choose among different functions to combine reviews to obtain item ranking. The performance and the cost of using the proposed system have been evaluated on the Ropsten Ethereum test network. For instance, our experiments have shown that the median time required to store a batch of 35 ratings is about 47 s, while the average time required to obtain the score of an item having 6000 ratings is less than 2.5 s.},

Additionally, the diverse range of directions in technology, gives a lot of options to the applicants to choose from.

Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform for different applications. Based on the need to an effective crowdfunding platform for developing smart nation and the inherent features of blockchain technology, we propose a global crowdfunding platform called BitFund. Investors and developers can act as different nodes of the network. The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached. The experimental results show that the proposed model yields better results as compared to other generic algorithms for crowdfunding.},

To tackle these challenges, we present a cost-efficient and blockchain-based secure framework for building a community of farmers and crowdsourcing the data generated by them to help the farmers’ community. Apart from ensuring privacy and security of data, a revenue model is also incorporated to provide incentives to farmers. These incentives would act as a motivating factor for the farmers to willingly participate in the process.

	abstract = {Deep learning, for image data processing, has been widely used to solve a variety of problems related to medical practices. However, researchers are constantly struggling to introduce ever efficient classification models. Recent studies show that deep learning can perform better and generalize well when trained using a large amount of data. Organizations such as hospitals, testing labs, research centers, etc. can share their data and collaboratively build a better learning model. Every organization wants to retain the privacy of their data, while on the other hand, these organizations want accurate and efficient learning models for various applications. The concern for privacy in medical data limits the sharing of data among multiple organizations due to some ethical and legal issues. To retain privacy and enable data sharing, we present a unique method that combines locally learned deep learning models over the blockchain to improve the prediction of lung cancer in health-care systems by filling the defined gap. There are several challenges involved in sharing that data while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we identify and address such challenges. The contribution of our work is four-fold: (i) We propose a method to secure medical data by only sharing the weights of the trained deep learning model via smart contract. (ii) To deal with different sized computed tomography (CT) images from various sources, we adopted the Bat algorithm and data augmentation to reduce the noise and overfitting for the global learning model. (iii) We distribute the local deep learning model wights to the blockchain decentralized network to train a global model. iv) We propose a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to estimate the region of interest (ROI) in theCT images. An extensive empirical study has been conducted to verify the significance of our proposed method for better prediction of cancer in the early stage. Experimental results of the proposed model can show that our proposed technique can detect the lung cancer nodules and also achieve better performance.},

It is crucial that we improve our energy management due to the ever-growing imbalance in demand-supply. The new wave in the energy sector is characterized by the three D's of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. For a sustainable life, it is necessary that energy is tapped from alternative sources that are renewable to leave a minimal carbon footprint. To integrate different sources with the main power grid, we require two-way communication among them. This makes it indispensable that consumers are empowered to protect their privacy and make them the sole owners of their data. A good access control scheme would ensure security of data, and an efficient trading platform would ensure judicious use of the resources. Here, we propose a framework URJA with an access control scheme and an energy trading platform based on blockchain for a smart grid.

	abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has exposed the privacy of positive patients to the public, which will lead to violations of users’ rights and even threaten their lives. A privacy-preserving scheme involving virus-infected positive patients is proposed by us. The traditional ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has the features of enhanced plaintext security and fine-grained access control. However, the encryption process requires the high computational performance of the device, which puts a high strain on resource-limited devices. After semi-honest users successfully decrypt the data, they will get the real private data, which will cause serious privacy leakage problems. Traditional cloud-based data management architectures are extremely vulnerable in the face of various cyberattacks. To address the above challenges, a verifiable ABE scheme based on blockchain and local differential privacy is proposed, using LDP to perturb the original data locally to a certain extent to resist collusion attacks, outsourcing encryption and decryption to corresponding service providers to reduce the pressure on mobile terminals, and deploying smart contracts in combination with blockchain for fair execution by all parties to solve the problem of returning wrong search results in a semi-honest cloud server. Detailed security proofs are performed through the defined security goals, which shows that the proposed scheme is indeed privacy-protective. The experimental results show that the scheme is optimized in terms of data accuracy, computational overhead, storage performance, and fairness. In terms of efficiency, it greatly reduces the local load, enhances personal privacy protection, and has high practicality as well as reliability. As far as we know, it is the first case of applying the combination of LDP technology and blockchain to a tracing system, which not only mitigates poisoning attacks on user data, but also improves the accuracy of the data, thus making it easier to identify infected contacts and making a useful contribution to health prevention and control efforts.},

	abstract = {Although blockchains are systems that are intended to survive on their own, they still may need human intervention like other Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) architectures. The reasons for this intervention are twofold: management of blockchain nodes and governance of blockchain. The second focuses on sustaining blockchain unlike the first one concerning with operation of individual nodes. Proposed blockchain governance models so far include cumbersome processes in which deciding and deployment of changes rely on the involvement of multiple actors. They have been criticized from various aspects such as reducing the decentralized nature of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a novel on-chain governance model exploiting both policy-based management and decentralized identity technologies. Since it allows controlling the behavior of the system via higher level expressions that are easy to understand, the policy based management concept will fit in well with blockchain ecosystems having stakeholders from different knowledge levels. This model is not only more effective regarding existing off-chain governance models but also is simpler and more user friendly than other on-chain governance models. Besides, the emerging decentralized identity concept has the potential for solving many problems related to decision-making process of blockchain governance. By employing this concept, our approach fortifies decentralization, security and fairness while providing well-directed governance. The smart contract based modular design of our framework opens the door for adoption of its components by other governance models as well.},

A decentralised, automated and secured financial platform is needed to enable all parties to control and track financial transactions, with no unauthorised changes allowed. The new technology, blockchain, enables data to be recorded, has no network participant with dominant power and manages data using specific functions, in line with smart contracts. The present study is the first to develop a framework proposing blockchain technology utilisation in IPD projects. The framework would enable core project team members to automatically execute all financial transactions, through coding the three main transactions of IPD projects: reimbursed costs, profit and cost saving, as functions of the IPD smart contract. To demonstrate the proposed framework's applicability, a “proof of concept” is developed and validated through an IPD case project. The practicality of the built-up hyperledger network (IBM® Blockchain Cloud Beta 2) and the advantages of the proposed smart contract functions are examined. The user-friendliness of the proposed financial system and its efficiency in automating all transactions are demonstrated. No deficiency is found in the blockchain network components. The study's findings, applied in a favourable external context, would facilitate IPD adoption and use across the AEC industry by providing a workable solution to existing financial barriers. The findings extend the horizon for further research on exploring blockchain's capabilities to solve comparable deficiencies to those affecting the AEC industry.},

	abstract = {Secure and scalable dynamic data interaction is significant to improve the level of medical collaboration and facilitate patients’ medical treatment. The consortium blockchain provides integrity and traceability management for medical data through preset authorized access and consensus mechanisms. However, how to realize the secure sharing of data among patients in the heterogeneous consortium blockchains, enabling users to own medical data ownership, and to share medical data securely and dynamically between different medical institutions is still challenging. To this end, we propose a cross-chain based access control model for medical data sharing, which model is patient-centered and solves the contradiction between medical data sharing and user privacy. Then, a dynamic access control strategy based on identity and role is designed. The strategy is written by smart contracts and can provide security for medical data access. Finally, in order to reduce the cost of storage on the blockchain, we adopted (InterPlanetary File System) IPFS as the storage system for medical data. Experimental results show that our model can complete the autonomous and secure authorization of medical data in milliseconds, and can realize the secure sharing of medical data onto heterogeneous consortium blockchains.},

Design/methodology/approach The analysis focuses on mapping the acceptance drivers of the blockchain technology by visualizing the users perception constructs through Blockchain hashtags. More than 5000 relevant tweets per day were collected between December 15, 2020, and January 15, 2021. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney tests were applied over the frequency of the characteristics and the emotions' measurements to validate the research hypotheses. Findings The results prove that users show more interest in security, shareability, and decentralization characteristics. Therefore, the blockchain technology usefulness is rather perceived in the informational domain, and the blockchain ease of use is further expressed in smart contracts as a use case. Blockchain benefits are more discussed than the drawbacks among Twitter users. Besides, positive feelings with strong emotions of trust and joy dominate among users. In summary, the results show significant awareness of users towards blockchain technology. Originality To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first study that explores the affective technology acceptance model with user-generated content analysis.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city, prevalent pub/sub (publish/subscribe) streaming systems have been increasingly employed as upstream middleware layer in multi-tenant edge clouds, and feed large volume of data gathered from IoT devices of different tenants into downstream systems (e.g., data analytics and warehouse). A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain. Our security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that BPS outperforms the state-of-the-art pub/sub streaming system Kafka in security with minimal performance overhead.},

However, such innovations may face greater resistance and implementation challenges in some sectors more than others. Here, we conduct 24 interviews with fishers, aquaculturists, restaurants, and industry experts around existing blockchain applications seeking to enhance seafood traceability and trackability in Australia. We combine innovation resistance theory, principal-agent theory, and the theory of planned behaviour to reveal how institutional norms and socio-cultural dynamics are deterring blockchain adoption. For example, the seafood industry exhibits limited digitization and automation, and an oligopoly of wholesalers with the power and networks to control the supply chain – against a backdrop of food fraud claims. Results suggest blockchain could threaten the competitive advantage of wholesalers, since it would reverse existing asymmetries around trade, price, and provenance information. Furthermore, despite favouring the decentralisation and information sharing that blockchain provides, other supply chain actors were hesitant to adopt it through fear of jeopardising relationships with these wholesalers upon which their business models rely. We emphasise that blockchain will only drive transformative change if the most influential supply chain actors see value in using it.},

The model distinguishes three basic elements: digital management, transaction business process and smart contract which determine the process optimization and the efficiency of implementing financial innovations in project supply chain.

In this regard, we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability, effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes. Furthermore, we implement a system prototype named BZDIMS that includes a challenge-response protocol, which allows users to selectively disclose their ownership of attributes to service providers to protect users’ behavior privacy. Performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacy protection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.},

The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are witnessing increased utilization throughout the world as an alternative to fossil–fueled vehicles. The extensive deployment of EVs can bring challenges to the grid if not properly integrated. Such challenges, however, could be exploited as opportunities if the huge unused capacity of the battery storage in millions of EVs are utilized for ancillary services to the grid and peer–to–peer (PtP) energy trade. Given that there is at least one human user per vehicle, human input must be considered to improve the scheduling process. To that end, this paper presents a new algorithm for bidirectional smart charging of EVs considering user preferences, PtP energy trade, and provision of ancillary services to the grid. The preferences of an EV user as input to the model are embedded into the scheduling process enabling the model to be adaptive to various conditions. Optimization slack variables are utilized for optimal management of EV battery SOC and energy allocation for multiple services. New indices are developed and introduced for quantification of the EV participation in ancillary services and PtP transactions. Real–world data has been collected and utilized for model specification and simulation to make the assumptions more realistic. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are validated using numerical studies. The results indicate that incorporating users’ preferences into the scheduling process would improve the aggregated revenue generated by the EV scheduling model which in turn could offset the charging costs by up to 100\%. Further, an increase of about 90\% in peer-to-peer energy transactions among EVs and 11\% in ancillary services provision to the grid are achieved through the developed user-centric smart charging model.},

In contrast, cyberattackers can be deterred from attacking AML-compliant permissioned DeFi. These results have important implications for trust as a construct within the context of blockchain-based sharing economy and institutional roles played by decentralized governance and smart contract auditors in creating a “trustless” state-space without forfeiting cybersecurity of a blockchain-based sharing economy.

Such changes however do not sufficiently account for circumstances of hardship, or black-swan events such as COVID-19, whereby the relative losers of trading arrangements should continue to receive outcomes which are not only efficient, but also fair and resilient. We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities. Evaluation and feedback from the company is also considered.},

	abstract = {Interim payment provisions in construction projects are susceptible to unfair practices. In construction project participants with varying financial capacities belonging to different organizations are bound by contractual relationships. Due to this type of project organizational structure, project participants do not completely trust each other which prevents the adoption of existing centralized automated frameworks for interim payment. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed blockchain-based framework that does not require to be trusted for automatically enforcing the terms and conditions related to interim payments and sharing payment records at project-level transparently and securely. A logic to automatically initiate, validate, and disburse interim payments according to general contract conditions for interim payments is formalized in this paper. A blockchain-based data model that enables selective-transparency in payment records is proposed. This data model facilitates the sharing of sensitive financial information privately between two contracting parties and non-sensitive payment-related information publicly among all project participants. The proposed blockchain-based framework is supported by a key management strategy to facilitate different security properties such as confidentiality and authenticity of data and users. Considering the non-technical nature of construction project participants, the proposed key management strategy is designed to dynamically generate cryptographic keys from publicly sharable parameters so that storage and management overheads are reduced. Security properties such as immutability, data confidentiality, user integrity, performance, and cost of deployment of the proposed blockchain framework are validated and recommendations for executing the proposed framework with a high level of security are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {With the development of 5G(5th generation mobile networks) technology, smart cities are an inevitable trend in modern city development. Among them, smart city services are the foundation of 5G-enabled smart cities. As an emerging and informational city service model, crowdsourcing has been widely used in our daily life. However, in the existing crowdsourcing systems, the requesters and the workers are usually required to use the crowdsourcing platform as the trust center, and the payment depends on the third-party central payment institutions, which have a massive security risk. Once these centers are attacked or do evil, it will bring higher losses to the crowdsourcing parties. These problems will negatively affect the further development of 5G-enabled smart cities. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-empowered and decentralized trusted service mechanism for the crowdsourcing system in 5G-enabled smart cities. In the proposed mechanism, the crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages: initialization, task submission, task publication, task reception, scheme submission, scheme arbitration, payment, task rollback, and service compensation. The smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage, and the payment is completed by blockchain without the involvement of third-party central institutions. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum and compare it with the existing crowdsourcing system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and applicability of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.},

Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Existing platforms for collaborative BIM design have a centralized system architecture, which suffers cybersecurity risks of design data manipulation and denial of access, leading to a loss of data traceability, a decline in design productivity, and project delays. Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.},

	abstract = {The blockchain-based access control mechanism (BACM) is gradually becoming an essential paradigm for solving dynamic and trusted access control problems in the open network environment. However, since the current open network environment has such features as dynamic variability and the uncertainty of user identity, most of the existing BACM cannot solve the access control problems in the current open network environment in a dynamic, flexible, proactive, efficient, and fine-grained approach. In this paper, we propose a novel BACM scheme to address such problems. Specifically, we first design a new, proactive, and fine-grained access control model, by utilizing the dynamicity and fine-grain of the attribute-based access control model, flexibility shown by the trust evaluation mechanism in evaluating the trust level of users, and proactivity shown by the game evaluation mechanism in curbing malicious users who suddenly launch malicious access requests. Second, based on the above access control model, we propose a dynamic, flexible, and proactive BACM for the current open network environment, exploiting the trustworthiness and transparency that the smart contract and the transaction mechanism in blockchain technology show during program execution. Further, a double sliding storage window is built, guaranteeing accurate data acquisition by BACM while efficiently allowing it to acquire time-sensitive data during the permission management process. Meanwhile, a pre-authorization concept is introduced to improve the efficiency and flexibility of BACM in processing access control problems. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed BACM scheme satisfies the simple security issue and the simple availability issue. Experiments on a real user trust record dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed BACM scheme in evaluating and deciding on access requests and the superiorities over most existing schemes in dynamicity, fine granularity, flexibility, and proactivity.},

In this work, a blockchain-based smart solution is presented for demand-side management of residential buildings in a neighborhood to improve Peaks to Average Ratios (PAR) of power load, reduce energy consumption, and increase the thermal comfort of occupants by modeling heating, illumination, and appliance systems. For real-time power and temperature monitoring of the neighborhood, a transient numerical physical model has been developed. The simulator has been validated with data measured from a building in Northern Italy. Then, a neighborhood with 2,000 households has been modeled for different occupancy patterns, initial values, and boundary conditions. Two different control scenarios, namely basic and smart, have been considered. In the basic scenario, everything is managed by occupants except the boiler, which is controlled by the indoor temperature of the home. Instead, in the smart scenario, a blockchain-based network has been introduced for buildings to exchange a parameter called the Probability of the Next Hour (PNH). Ethereum Solidity has been deployed for smart contract development in the blockchain. The results show that using blockchain-connected smart controllers aimed at demand-side management can improve PAR, comfort level, and energy efficiency of buildings, which can bring about CO2 reduction on an urban and even global scale.},

	abstract = {Context Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms. Objective Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organizations by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model. Method This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. The decision model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problems in software production. Results We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort. Conclusion We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of captured knowledge regarding Decentralized Autonomous Organization Platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

In this paper, we combine the concept of blockchain with attribute-based signcryption to provide a secure data sharing in the cloud environment. The proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements of the cloud computing such as confidentiality and unforgeability. Further, the smart contract solves the problem of cloud storage such as returning wrong results as in the traditional cloud server.

Thereby is the development of a holistic and data-continuous traceability system, which provides transparency of records for the entire manufacturing flow from raw materials to the final product, one of the main challenges. While some solutions already address traceability issues in supply chain management and manufacturing, customized and volatile industries, in which each product features a unique configuration, are still lacking appropriate models and proofs of concept. In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures. The proposed blockchain architecture is based on a consortium Ethereum network and a Proof of Authority consensus, which delivers a trusted and shared database within an economic processing framework. To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract. A user-friendly front-end application simplifies the querying of the recorded traceability data and visualizes existing dependencies.},

IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.},

	abstract = {The introduction of a review system in e-commerce platforms results in an effective business model. The effects of positive/negative reviews on the success of a product are well studied in the literature. Therefore, for the vendors, it is crucial to obtain positive reviews of their products. This fact opens fraudulent scenarios. Indeed, some vendors can pay an incentive to the buyers to obtain, in exchange, a fake positive review. This fake-review system (FRS) is so widespread that vendors rely on ad-hoc companies that, through intermediaries, find buyers available to release fake reviews. In this paper, we propose a game-theory-based strategy to discourage the above fraudulent business model, and an effective way to implement this strategy leveraging an Ethereum smart contract. Specifically, the contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we formalize the current business model as a sequential game, and we identify sufficient conditions making FRS advantageous. Second, we propose to introduce in the review system a new mechanism, thanks to which, the corresponding sequential game requires conditions necessary to make advantageous FRS that are strictly less convenient than the previous ones. We implemented the solution and evaluate the cost of the smart contract execution.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been envisaged to commence an era of decentralised applications and services (DApps) without the need for a trusted intermediary. Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated, peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services’ performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback mechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the ecosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem by introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding light on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are currently en vogue, thanks to the infrastructure provided by the blockchain technology. However, their effective use requires that the textual (legalese) specification of the contract be accompanied by a precise computational definition of the actions leading to its satisfaction or breach, as well as of their admissible sequences. Insofar as contracts can be viewed as prescribing transactional exchanges of well-specified resources among well-specified actors, contract execution can be modelled as following some protocol in a closed world. This suggests a modelling of such executions as interactive processes in reaction systems, where the entities in the background set represent possible allocations of resources to actors and reactions describe changes in such allocations. We use this type of reaction systems and interactive processes as a basis for the modelling of transactions and contracts and explore properties of such processes, highlighting their peculiarities with respect to the original notion of interactive processes in reaction systems. We also discuss several constructions for composition and decomposition of processes, which guarantee equivalence of effects: two interactive processes are equivalent if, starting from the same initial set of allocations, they produce the same final set of allocations.},

Then, the comprehensive evaluation value (CEV) was calculated for each type of subjects. On this basis, the transaction strategy was optimized with the goal of maximizing the matching satisfaction of the two sides of the transaction. After that, the blockchain technology was introduced to the power matching decision-making process.

	abstract = {Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem.},

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes.

	abstract = {As a disruptive technology, the blockchain is continuously finding novel application contexts, bringing new opportunities and radical changes. In this paper, we use blockchain as a communication infrastructure to support multi-party business processes. In particular, through smart contracts specifically generated by the mentioned business process, it is possible to derive a trustable infrastructure enabling the interaction among parties. Moreover, the emergence of different blockchain technologies, satisfying different characteristics, gives the possibility to support the same business process dealing with different non-functional needs. In this paper, we propose a novel engineering methodology supported by a practical framework called Multi-Chain. It permits to derive, using a model-driven strategy, a blockchain-based infrastructure, that can be deployed over a specific blockchain technology (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric). The objective is to permit the single definition and multiple deployments of the business process, to deliver the same functionalities, but satisfying different non-functional needs. In such a way, organisations willing to cooperate can select the multi-party business process and the blockchain technology they would like to use to satisfy their needs. Using Multi-Chain, they will be able to automatically derive from a Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) choreography diagram a blockchain infrastructure ready to be used. This overcomes the need to get acquainted with many details of the specific technology.},

	abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.},

Therefore, according to the I4.0 manufacturing requirements of node scalability, trusted delivery and standard information modeling in the turnkey process, the paper proposes a reference information architecture of blockchain-driven turnkey project to establish a turnkey service system with AAS as the delivery core: (1) Take RAMI4.0 and I4.0 component as the engineering construction framework and supporting technology, by analyzing the bottleneck of blockchain in solving the I4.0 workshop, integrating the open blockchain architecture interoperability characteristics of BC-Based smart contract and Tangle-Based extensible IIoT-node, and establish complete solution to turnkey project information architecture under the I4.0 workshop; (2) Combined with the current turnkey project, this paper proposes and studies the AAS modeling method supporting blockchain verification and the delivery constraint mechanism based on smart contract, and designs the blockchain-based architecture, operation and implementation process with AAS as the delivery core; (3) Through the development and integration of key technologies, an experimental development and operation case of the turnkey project of the I4.0 workshop customized production line is given, which provides theoretical and technical references for more SMEs to quickly integrate into the turnkey project system.},

Using blockchain technology (BT) network system for optimization, a smart contract is used to build a risk management system of NPO, so that public opinion can be traced through the smart ledger using risk association tree technology. First, BT, NPO, and related theories of risk management are introduced. Second, the network situation of public opinion dissemination in the blockchain environment is discussed. Finally, a BT-based risk management model of the NPO is implemented, and experiments are conducted to verify the effect of the model. Furthermore, the theoretical framework of NPO credibility model detection is optimized according to the public opinion risk prediction model. The research results reveal that the three experimental schemes reached the peak density of the number of public opinion disseminators in the third step, and the highest values were 0.1335, 0.1318, and 0.1296, respectively. Moreover, the density of public opinion dissemination in the three experimental schemes reached a stable state of 0.087, 0.088, and 0.0898, respectively after 48 steps. Under BT, the designed three experimental schemes can reasonably conduct the risk prediction and credibility detection of NPO.

	abstract = {Data outsourcing has become a popular application. Searchable encryption (SE) can provide data retrievability as well as keep data privacy. In the threat model of SE schemes, the cloud server is usually assumed to be Honest-But-Curious, but this may not be true in reality. The blockchain-based SE makes malicious cloud servers dare not to deviate from the protocol, and search results are validated by miners. However, rational miners would skip the validation step and accept the block directly to save computational resources. This situation is called the Verifier’s Dilemma which will make the blockchain-based SE scheme not real verifiable. Therefore, this paper proposes a verifiable blockchain-based public-key encryption scheme that outsources the verification to the TrueBit network. This design makes our scheme achieves effective verifiability which will minimize the computational cost of miners. Furthermore, our scheme also establishes a fair payment protocol between the multiple data owners and data users. Also, the data owner can revoke the permission of the document he/she shared before. We also present security proofs and analysis of the proposed scheme. Performance evaluation presents the overheads of performing search operations on the cloud server and conducting transactions on smart contracts in Ethereum.

The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts’ opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance.

This paper presents a decentralized cooperative DR framework to manage the daily energy exchanges within a community of Smart-Buildings, in the presence of local Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The proposed algorithm taps into the flexibility of the participants to let them decide of a day-ahead community power profile, and subsequently ensures the forecast tracking during the next day. In practice, the algorithm is fully decentralized by the Blockchain technology, that enables a trusted communication medium among the participants and enforces autonomous monitoring and billing via Smart-Contracts. With such an energy management framework, participating Smart-Buildings can together aim at a common objective, such as carbon-free resources usage or aggregated grid services, without depending on a centralized aggregator/utility. Simulations on realistic Swiss building models demonstrate that nearly all the renewable production resources could be harnessed locally through the presented framework, compared to selfish individual optimization. Under a quadratic cost of grid electricity, the considered community profile could dramatically be flattened, hence avoiding costly peaks at the grid interface. A scalability analysis shows that, considering the current public Ethereum Blockchain, the framework could handle a community size of up to 100 Smart-Buildings.},

There are some problems in distributed energy trading, such as high transaction frequency, small transaction volume, high operation cost, lack of information supervision and so on. The openness, transparency, tamper-proof and automatic execution of smart contracts of blockchain technology are consistent with the transaction demand of distributed energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent transaction model of distributed energy based on blockchain. First, the peer to peer transaction mode and transaction process are analysed. Second, a multi-agent dynamic Stackelberg game is launched. It takes distributed generation owners, energy storage companies and a grid corporation as leaders to conduct power bidding. Third, with consumers as followers, the time of use tariff bidding strategy was solved. The obtained results reveal that distributed energy resources are essential in the energy supply of carbon neutrality, which also determines the complementary relationship between a grid corporation and distributed generation owners. The two agents work together to exert effectiveness for the new power system. There is a large space for energy storage companies to improve, and consumers show a trend of off-peak power consumption.},

OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.},

For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9\%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.},

	abstract = {With the development of international trade, the core position of port transportation progressively emerges. However, most current port supply chain systems adopt a centralized data management mode. Each operator in the supply chain has its platform and data set, which is prone to form information islands and can create trust issues, resulting in the inefficient overall operation of the supply chain. To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, a port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain (Fabric-PSChain) is designed and implemented. In the proposed system, four smart contracts are developed by taking advantage of the blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-free, distributed consensus, combined with the Role-Based Access Control Policy (RBACP), realizing the functions of access control policy formulation, enterprise list query, cargo order uploading, and order query. At the same time, the regulator node is added to the Fabric-PSchain system to enhance the credibility and security of data and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Experimental results show that the Fabric-PSChain system has vital confidentiality and data sharing that can speed up the operation of the port supply chain business and has significant application value for the shipping logistics industry.},

	abstract = {The use of cryptocurrencies offers attractive business opportunities, in the context of financial services, smart contracts and token-based business models. The objective of this study is to provide a value-based understanding of what drives people to use cryptocurrencies for value exchange. Based on the users’ perceived value of the technology, as logic of decision making, we explore the role of perceived financial value and the perceived emotional value in the intention to use the technology. The unified technology adoption theory provides the potential drivers of these value concepts, which are extended accounting for sustainability. Furthermore, to capture users’ evolving experience with blockchain technologies, we propose the concept of the cryptocurrency knowledge path, capturing the scope and depth of users’ knowledge on the applicability of cryptocurrencies, as potential influence on the value concepts in the decision to actively use cryptocurrencies. For the analysis, a structural model is set up and estimated using partial least square analysis (PLS-SEM). We identify a positive effect of both value concepts, financial and emotional value, on the intention to use cryptocurrencies. However, interestingly, we find that the emotional value assessment is fully mediated through the knowledge path. Furthermore, we find that environmental sustainability considerations are fully mediated through either of the two value concepts. These results provide guidance for a customer-centric, sustainable design and marketing of crypto-projects.},

	abstract = {The capital required to maintain infrastructure in good repair falls short globally. This is commonly referred to as the “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.},

	abstract = {The voluminous amount of data generated by individuals’ mobile sensors and wearable devices is considered of a great value for the benefits of patients and clinical research. Recent advances incorporating data mining and cloud computing have leveraged the great potential of these data. However, the introduction of such technologies in the process of mobile crowd sensed data mining and analytics could potentially lead to security and privacy concerns. Individuals and organizations are not able to share and collectively run computations on their private data captured by different sensors to infer any processes of common interest. Although solutions such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) were laid decades ago, they are still perceived for theoretical interest only, so far. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap between privacy-preserving data mining and its practice. To do so, we introduce a blockchain-based privacy-preserving SVM classification (BPPSVC) between mutually distrustful data owners. In BPPSVC, blockchain technology along with smart contracts underlay more realistic assumptions about the adversarial model. Our main focus is on investigating the immutability, security and the bookkeeping properties of the blockchain in preserving the privacy of an SVM classifier over horizontally distributed IoT data. To this end, we first propose the system architecture, adversary model and design goals of BPPSVC, then we describe the design details. Our security analysis indicates that the proposed system is secure and it provides fairness and protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. We finally show the efficiency and feasibility of BPPSVC through rigorous experimental results.},

	abstract = {Multi-party systems are important for business processes but can be complex. Blockchain facilitates trust in multi-party systems by providing transparency, decentralised control, and immutable transaction history, to improve security and accountability between parties. The use of cryptographic hashes and the continual validation of the shared ledger in a blockchain system provides parties with data integrity for historical transactions and process integrity for smart contract execution. However, in the design of a broader system combining a blockchain with off-chain components, it is not always clear how system-level integrity is supported. This paper proposes two modelling schemes to better understand blockchain's support for integrity in multi-party blockchain-based systems. The schemes model interactions between components in an architecture as security protocols, for analysis by standard techniques and tools. We first illustrate how blockchain-based systems can be abstractly modelled directly as security protocols. Then we show how blockchain-specific issues such as consensus-based ‘forking’ (also known as ‘orphan blocks’ or ‘uncle blocks’) can be encoded. This allows transaction reordering behaviour to manifest in the model, and allows design mitigation for that problem to be checked. We illustrate our approach with analyses of three design alternatives for possible enhancements to a multi-party system for sharing trade certificates.},

This has driven innovation towards the affirmation of decentralized systems, in line with the Self Sovereign Identity paradigm. User control over the consumption and disclosure of their data is a key topic of such drive. In this paper we show how it is possible to apply this increasingly popular concept to a traditionally centralized and opaque digital process: Access Control systems. To this aim we expand the XACML standard for Attribute Based Access Control systems with the novel concept of private attributes, i.e. attributes whose values should not be disclosed while still contributing to a policy evaluation result after user consent. Basing our proposal on blockchain systems, we show how to leverage smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs to allow for transparent policies evaluation without disclosing the value of such sensible attributes. Beside formalizing our goals, presenting the system architecture, and discussing its advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional model, we provide a reference example to show our proposal innovative capabilities and provide a prototype experimental evaluation to prove its feasibility.},

	abstract = {The emergence of on-demand service provisioning by Federated Cloud Providers (FCPs) to Cloud Users (CU) has fuelled significant innovations in cloud provisioning models. Owing to the massive traffic, massive CU resource requests are sent to FCPs, and appropriate service recommendations are sent by FCPs. Currently, the Fourth-Generation (4G)-Long Term Evolution (LTE) network faces bottlenecks that affect end-user throughput and latency. Moreover, the data is exchanged among heterogeneous stakeholders, and thus trust is a prime concern. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Blockchain (BC)-leveraged rank-based recommender scheme, FedRec, to expedite secure and trusted Cloud Service Provisioning (CSP) to the CU through the FCP at the backdrop of base 5G communication service. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a BC-integrated request-response broker model is formulated between the CU, Cloud Brokers (BR), and the FCP, where a CU service request is forwarded through the BR to different FCPs. For service requests, Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is supported by 5G-enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service. In the next phase, a weighted matching recommender model is proposed at the FCP sites based on a novel Ranking-Based Recommender (RBR) model based on the CU requests. In the final phase, based on the matching recommendations between the CU and the FCP, Smart Contracts (SC) are executed, and resource provisioning data is stored in the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) that expedite the block validations. The proposed scheme FedRec is compared in terms of SC evaluation and formal verification. In simulation, FedRec achieves a reduction of 27.55\% in chain storage and a transaction throughput of 43.5074 Mbps at 150 blocks. For the IPFS, we have achieved a bandwidth improvement of 17.91\%. In the RBR models, the maximum obtained hit ratio is 0.9314 ​at 200 million CU requests, showing an improvement of 1.2\% in average servicing latency over non-RBR models and a maximization trade-off of QoE index of 2.7688 at the flow request 1.088 and at granted service price of USD 1.559 million to FCP for provided services. The obtained results indicate the viability of the proposed scheme against traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Supervising the product's integrity and procedures in a multi-participant supply chain environment is a noteworthy issue. In recent years blockchain technology (BT) has made an appearance as a paramount model, as it bestows secure tracking, benchmark, and trust formation between stakeholders in a cost-efficient solution. To control the foregoing concerns, data analytics is indispensable on blockchain-based secure data and hence elevates the significance of surfacing technology Machine Learning (ML). The reliability of data and its distribution are very pivotal in ML to enhance the accuracy of results. In this paper, a blockchain-based secured information sharing method called Lebesgue IntegrableConsensus and Interpolated Gaussian Learning-based (LIC-IGL) authentication to provide pharmaceutical data integrity and security is proposed. The LIC-IGL method is split into two sections. First, validation of block is performed by applying the Lebesgue Integrable Consensus model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing the Adaptive Support Vector Machine Authentication model via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, distinct products are provided between and within the blocks, therefore, ensuring secured pharmaceutical product sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed and existing methods is compared with certain parameters such as latency, authentication accuracy, and false positive rate with respect to distinct numbers of products. The results acquired from the experiments exhibit a superior execution of the proposed method upon comparison with the state-of-the-art blockchain-based authentication methods and it shows enhanced simulated results with good authentication accuracy, minimizing the latency and false positive rate.},

In particular, we model the cheating decisions of a platform as chance-constrained programming and develop a Monte Carlo simulation method based on exploited optimality properties to solve it. Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the system reduces platforms’ motivation to cheat to an acceptable level.

	abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-enabled Stackelberg game model is proposed for the Quality-of-Service Optimized Link State Routing (QoS-OLSR) protocol in urban VANET. While QoS-OLSR protocols introduce game models, Stackelberg in specific, to select stable relays, the information exchanged by nodes and the selection process cannot be trusted. The introduction of Blockchain to VANET arose as a means for adding trust. However, existing works integrating blockchain do not fully exploit its capabilities in hosting verified reputations, selecting relays, or sharing monetary incentives to motivate cooperation of relays. Therefore, the proposed Stackelberg game model integrates off-chain QoS-OLSR protocol and designed on-chain smart contracts, which consists of two managers: Node Reputation Manager (NRM) and Relay Selection Game Manager (RSGM) to select relays. The proposed game model has three stages: 1) the role identification, 2) the off-chain follower incentive selection, and 3) the on-chain leader profit maximization. The first stage is for nodes identify their role in the game model; leader or follower. Then, the second stage allows followers (nodes) to calculate incentives for leaders (relays) based on off-chain exchanged QoS-OLSR messages including QoS and reputation. NRM allows verifying the reputations within the messages of nodes. The calculated incentives are deposited to RSGM as followers’ strategies. The third stage, executed on-chain in RSGM, generates the set of accepted followers for a leader reliably and forwards the deposited incentives to leaders. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate that the proposed game model outperforms in terms of leaders’ utility and followers’ payments while keeping the percentage of relays constant compared to the benchmark model. Furthermore, cost analysis confirms the feasibility and cost-efficiency of such a model.},

Now, Blockchain proves to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services. Applications are being explored in healthcare (patient records), government (land registries) and electronics (Internet of Things). The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation. The characteristics of Industry 4.0 meets the blockchain-based system and the model can aid these changes.},

The framework benefits from the blockchain’s inherent advantages, such as distributed storage, consensus mechanism, and avoidance of single-point of failure while addressing typical challenges of employing blockchain technology in smart grids, such as the limitation of computation power and the high bandwidth requirements for data exchange. In the first layer of the proposed architecture, the security state of the system is determined based on the state opinion of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), using a consensus mechanism. Then, in the second layer, Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) use the first layer opinion to preserve the proper WAMS operation when some of the PMUs are compromised. In this setting and by utilizing a co-simulation testbed, we show the effectiveness of using smart contracts whereby PMUs and PDCs can reliably communicate and aggregate smart grid measurements while time synchronization and fault identification functionalities are appropriately maintained. We also evaluate several deployment scenarios and provide corresponding recommendations for the security enhancement of WAMS. Finally, we detail a fortification strategy that the Power System Operator (PSO) can use to harden the blockchain network, based on an adversarial model.},

These platforms enable people to create business value through participating in structured, financially incentivized but essentially voluntary relationships, and by engaging their human creative freedom to serve each other and co-create business value. For example, Haier Group manufactures large home appliances in China by an ecosystem made up of over four thousand mostly small teams making things and trading with each other by way of self-organized, self-negotiated lateral relationships that are smart-contract enabled, with no vertical middle managers. The case will be of interest to scholars because of the unique philosophy and practice, and the success of the approach at promoting both human development on a wide scale, and dramatic marketplace and business success of the ecosystem. The authors are scholars of business ecosystems. They report that this case was not understandable to them through the logic of their previous study of business ecosystems, a logic of strategy and organization design that presumes a limited, knowable, and closed model of each person and a management philosophy of control. In contrast, Haier Group presumes an unlimited, unknowable, and open image of each person, and a management philosophy of augmented personal creativity and platform-enabled coevolution with others. The authors provide a new term adapted from biology, human ecosystem, to highlight human values on which business ecosystems can vary, with important consequences for human development as well as business performance as traditionally measured.

	abstract = {The management of construction projects requires adequate techniques to support the continual exchange of information across disciplines. Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation. The proposed approach gives stakeholders more confidence when sharing their BIM data, reduces costs, and improves risk contingencies in construction projects. The paper provides a cost analysis to evidence the implications of using Blockchain for BIM data provenance through an experimental framework supported by an Ethereum public test network. A front-end web page has also been created to facilitate interaction with smart contracts and to monitor the BIM data provenance process.},

	abstract = {As the complexity of emergencies continues to increase, responding to them often exceeds the capabilities of any single public agency, multi-agent collaborative participation is an inevitable tendency in the development of emergency management. In the collaborative emergency response, it is important to support various responders with a unified platform to assist in decision-making, distribution of resources, and coordination of emergency operation. In recent years, blockchain has provided strong support for the innovation of emergency management mechanisms with its technical advantages such as distributed storage, decentralization, consensus algorithms, tamper-proof, traceability, and smart contract. This study firstly reviews the development of blockchain and its application in emergency management. Secondly, the connotation and key dilemmas of the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism are expounded from two aspects of the multi-agent participation and the construction of a collaborative mechanism. Then, the possibility of using blockchain to facilitate the innovation of multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism is analyzed from the aspects of emergency management information sharing, resource storage and distribution, the rights and obligations of multiple subjects, supervision, reward and punishment. Finally, a conceptual model of a multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism based on alliance chain and public chain is proposed. The application of blockchain provides a new perspective and motivation for the innovation of emergency management system. This study provides a new method for improving the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism, and is an important supplement and innovation to existing emergency management studies.},

This paper attempts to improve the intelligence, real-timeliness, and security of the direct transaction between DE generation companies (DEGCs) and users, and reduce the default frequency of distributed power (DP) transactions. For these purposes, a P2P DE transaction model for the IIoT was proposed based on blockchain. Firstly, a blockchain-based distributed energy peer-to-peer transaction framework is constructed, which is more suitable for generalized energy transactions based on typical transaction scenarios of the IIoT. Using credit value evaluation and smart contracts to ensure the transparency, openness, and non-tampering of credit scores. On this basis, the energy currency reward mechanism is used to promote the trustworthiness of transaction nodes and maintain transaction security. Finally, the P2P direct transaction based on credit value was designed to improve the transaction efficiency and security. Through case analysis, the DE transaction model for the IIoT, which is based on the credit value of the blockchain, supports fast and frequent energy transactions, as it overcomes the confirmation delays of energy blockchain transactions. The proposed model improves the efficiency of DE transactions in the IIoT, effectively suppresses default frequency, and maintains the order of DE market in the IIoT.},

As such, a disruption can wreak havoc to a supply chain network, rendering the ability of a firm to respond to these disruptions with appropriate recovery strategies paramount. In this paper, we analyze such recovery strategies in a supply chain network. The specific model we develop aims at predicting a disruption that may occur in a context where smart contracts have been implemented based on blockchain technology. Within this setting, we suggest appropriate measures to be undertaken by an organization to mitigate the disruption and avoid negative performance outcomes as much as possible. If the disruption cannot be avoided, the proposed genetic algorithm-based approach focuses on adopting re-active measures to manage the post-disruption reality. As such, we effectively integrate both pre- and post-disruption scenarios to offer wholistic decision-support in an integrated fashion, extending prior work which mostly developed guidance only for either pre- or post-disruption responses. Specifically, we study the performance of a complex multi-echelon supply chain network, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, under various conditions. The insights derived discern the effect of mitigation measures during a disruption, offering valuable guidance for decision makers.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid development of cloud computing for many years, data security and trusted computing are still the main challenges in current cloud computing applications. In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter’s secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a “block-and-response” mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme.},

	abstract = {Cold chains are effective in maintaining food quality and reducing food losses, especially for long-distance international food commerce. Several recent reports have demonstrated that frozen foods are serving as carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus from one place to another without any human-to-human contact. This finding highlights significant difficulties facing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and reveal a transmission mechanism that may have substantially worsened the global pandemic. Traditional food cold chain management practices do not include specific procedures related to SARS-CoV-2-related environmental control and information warnings; therefore, such procedures are urgently needed to allow food to be safely transported without transmitting SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a conjoint analysis of COVID-19 and food cold chain systems was performed, and the results of this analysis were used to develop an improved food cold chain management system utilizing internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. First, 45 COVID-19-related food cold chain incidents in China, primarily involving frozen meat and frozen aquatic products, were summarized. Critical food cold chain control points related to COVID-19 were analyzed, including temperature and cold chain requirements. A conceptual system structure to improve food cold chain management, including information sensing, chain linking and credible tracing, was proposed. Finally, a prototype system, which consisted of cold chain environment monitoring equipment, a cold chain blockchain platform, and a food chain management system, was developed. The system includes: 1) a defining characteristic of the newly developed food cold chain system presented here is the use of IoT technology to enhance real-time environmental information sensing capacity; 2) a hybrid data storage mechanism consisting of off-chain and on-chain systems was applied to enhance data security, and smart contracts were used to establish warning levels for food cold chain incidents; and 3) a hypothetical food cold chain failure scenario demonstration in which information collection, intelligent decision making, and cold chain tracing were integrated and automatically generated for decision-making. By integrating existing technologies and approaches, our study provides a novel solution to improve traditional food cold chain management and thus meet the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our system has been shown to be effective, subsequent studies are still required to develop precise risk evaluation models for SARs-CoV-2 in food cold chains and more precisely control the entire process. By ensuring food safety and reliable traceability, our system could also contribute to the formulation of appropriate mechanisms for international cooperation and minimize the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international food commerce.},

	abstract = {Today massive amounts of data are generated from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors that can be streamed in real-time and utilized for building valuable services. As the demand for data sharing has increased, a new business model of data marketplace has emerged that allows individuals to sell their data to buyers for monetary gain. However, these data marketplaces are prone to various threats such as unauthorized data redistribution/reselling, tampering of data, dishonest data ownership claims, and trade of bogus data. The existing solutions related to data ownership traceability are unable to address the above issues due to ambiguous data ownership, undisclosed data reselling, and dispersal of data ownership across multiple marketplaces. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain framework, TrailChain, that uses watermarking to generate a trusted trade trail for tracking the data ownership spanning across multiple decentralized marketplaces. Our solution includes mechanisms for detecting any unauthorized data reselling within and across marketplaces. We also propose a fair resell payment sharing scheme that ensures the resell revenue is shared with the data owners over authorized reselling. We present a prototype implementation of the system using Ethereum. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate TrailChain’s feasibility by benchmarking performance metrics including execution gas costs, execution time, latency and throughput.},

However, miners are uncertain about the exact income and the exact cost of executing transactions. Thus, they are not able to make informed decisions of which transactions to select and execute in order to maximise their profits. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty that miners perceive about the income and the cost of executing transactions and the impact of this uncertainty on the profit miners can gain. To achieve this aim, we design a simulation model, collect the input data for the model, implement the model and run an experiment on the model. Our simulation results show that the uncertainty miners perceive about the cost of executing transactions has a significant impact on the block profit. On the contrary, our results do not show a significant impact of the income uncertainty on the block profit.},

The integration of distributed energy resources in China with blockchain technology may break the existing pattern where the production, transportation, distribution and sales of energy are centralized. This paper first summarizes the current status of distributed energy resources in China and blockchain technology, and then uses the Michael Porter five forces model to analyze the competitiveness of distributed energy resources. The rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of alternatives, bargaining power of suppliers, and bargaining power of buyers in energy industry are presented and analyzed. Based on the competitiveness analysis, the SWOT model is used to analyze the joint development model of “blockchain technology + distributed energy resources”, and the feasibility of blockchain technology applied to distributed energy resources systems is revealed.

	abstract = {Context: Process views support the paradigm of Business Process Outsourcing, in which providers perform business processes on behalf of their clients. A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views. Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent. Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture. Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration. Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.},

As the market players, prosumers in the local distribution network are considered in two groups, producers (sellers) and consumers (buyers). Using smart contracts, all sellers and buyers in the proposed market can engage in bilateral energy token transactions (P2P) with each other under an agreed price and with the retail market at a certain price. Furthermore, the local consumers can participate in price-based DR programs and shift their consuming load to the periods with high local generation. Demurrage mechanism is applied to avoid energy token accumulation and enhance attraction for local transactions. With demurrage in place, the redemption value of energy-backed tokens reduces with time. A fully decentralized approach called the primal-dual sub-gradient method is developed to clear this fully decentralized energy market in the presence of DR programs and demurrage. The proposed market-clearing scheme guarantees the global and feasible solution without requiring the players' private information. Numerical studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy token market and the decentralized approach for its clearing.},

The present day predictions for the influence of IoT are highly monumental. This is because data of any form is found to be predominant to the IoT paradigm, therefore serving different applications like smart home, smart city, healthcare, smart grid, smart farms, manufacturing, and so on. Hence, several heterogeneous sensors are said in existence to estimate different types of parameters and found to be useful for different users. In this paper, a secured image sharing method called a Blockchain Chaotic and Paillier Map-based Authentication (BC-PMA) to provide image data integrity and security by deploying a cloud computing environment is proposed. The BC-PMA method is split into three sections. First, registration of corresponding classes of images in the cloud server via blockchain is presented by employing the Cat Map Registration model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing Paillier Map-based Authentication where validation is ensured via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, unique and separate classes of images are provided with the respective, therefore ensuring secured classes of image sharing between users in the cloud environment. The results have been analyzed against traditional blockchain-based methods and validated with enhanced simulated results, that good authentication accuracy, minimizing the false positive rate, block generation time, and size considerably. Experimental Result shows that the Authentication Accuracy of the proposed BC-PMA method is improved by 23\%, and minimizes the False Positive Rate and Computational Cost by 32\% and 22\% when compared to the Existing Method.},

An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved. Finally, we implement the protocols, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.},

	abstract = {The large integration of variable renewable energy sources brings new challenges to system operations due to their volatile nature. In this context, demand response programs appear as an important alternative to match the instantaneous supply and demand of energy by changing the electric use of end-users. The traditional load control schemes of demand response are the direct and indirect control. While the direct schemes assure coordination and fail in scalability, the indirect schemes assure scalability, but they could fail in coordination. To face some of the challenges, this paper defines a framework and mathematical formulation for the interactions between a demand aggregator and its end-users, based on flexibility bands. It allows the aggregator to communicate and control a higher number of end-users at the same time that the end-users can make local decisions regarding their consumption. The flexibility band is a control signal, composed of an upper and a lower consumption bound, so that end consumers can consume electricity in the way they want as long as they stay within these bounds. The band features can be linked to contractual arrangements allowing the creation of new products for electricity markets. The simulations consider an aggregator interacting with 10000 end-users. The end-users present different types of flexible loads, such as thermal, deferrable, and non-interruptible loads. The results indicate that this scheme is capable of achieving scalability and coordination, and it has the potential to provide new services such as adjusting the flexibility bands after the first response from end-users.},

Under the open workshop architecture, intelligent workshop, as an important part of intelligent system, has acute problems such as safe sharing of manufacturing data and opaque monitoring of manufacturing process. This paper proposes the architecture of I4.0 workshop reference manufacturing system based on blockchain. Combined with I4.0 component and blockchain technology, this paper focuses on the mechanism and key implementation technologies of workshop manufacturing chain from three aspects: standardized information modeling, distributed control and trusted autonomous execution. By studying the autonomous trusted trigger mechanism of smart contract and the distributed storage method of manufacturing data in workshop manufacturing system, integrating workshop service system, a system operation mechanism of manufacturing data security and manufacturing process trusted trigger is established. In addition, based on the standardized modeling method of I4.0 components, the Asset Administration Shell-Blockchain process data verification model is designed, and the standardized blockchain verification model is established from the equipment layer to support the system architecture. Finally, the implementation of the prototype verification system is analyzed by selecting representative verification sources.},

Aiming at the problem that the leakage of electricity consumption information threatens the privacy security of users and the leakage of electricity trading plan destroys the fairness of the DAM, a privacy protection scheme for electricity transactions in microgrid DAM based on consortium blockchain is proposed. Firstly, the scheme is based on the ElGamal algorithm that generates anonymous identities for users involved in transactions, preventing leakage of electricity consumption information and allowing the real identity of the fraudster to be traced in the event of fraudulent transactions. Secondly, a certificateless signcryption (CLS) algorithm is improved to realize the encryption and authentication of the user's electricity trading plan, which enhances the efficiency of the scheme. Finally, the scheme realizes decentralized trading of users in the microgrid in the DAM through the consortium blockchain and smart contracts, ensuring transaction security and improving transaction efficiency. The scheme is proved to have high security under different types of attacks by stochastic prediction machine model. Moreover, by calculating the computation time for different kinds of operations in the two stages of signcryption and unsigncryption, it is concluded that the computation cost of this scheme is lower than that of other schemes of the same type has higher efficiency.},

With the introduction of a hybrid AC/DC inverter in this system, efficient energy management is realized to achieve the minimization of the cost of the energy balance among purchasing, renewable generation, curtailment and reserve capacity. This cost reduction is achieved by either meeting the load or selling surplus energy, and dispensing a residential demand load controller. To address the dynamic problem and with uncertainties regarding the load, renewable energy, and energy purchase and sale tariffs, a mixed integer linear programming model was developed with adjustable robust programming (ADJ-ROBUST-MILP), and it also involves technical restrictions and criteria for increasing the life cycle of the storage system. The dynamic aspect imparts practical applicability via the permanent correction of the ADJ-ROBUST-MILP solution with a heuristic that acts proactively in the developed dynamics by observing prior conditions. The case studies demonstrate that the mathematical heuristic is able to confer benefit to the energy scheduling of smart home energy management while presenting computational complexity capable of being used in real systems, which is exemplified herein.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain technology) can play significant roles in improving supply chain management and sustainability. Blockchain technology can support responsible sourcing and ensure compliance with environmental standards by boosting traceability and transparency in sustainable supply chains. Nevertheless, blockchain technology has not been widely applied in this field due to the lack of familiarity of managers with its intrinsic characteristics. This study investigates the performance improvement, arising from the blockchain implementation, to address the problem of managerial conservatism and this technology adoption. Accordingly, an analytical approach is proposed to identify blockchain technology adoption enablers and analyze their impact on supply chain performance. At first, the main enablers, derived from the literature review, are explored using network theory. The existing causal relationships between enablers are extracted based on a multi-expertise team members’ agreement. Then, the fuzzy inference system is employed to determine the weights of relationships between the identified enablers and supply chain performance-related targets. After modeling the extracted causal relationships using the fuzzy cognitive map model, a scenario is defined for each enabler, and its impact on improving supply chain performance is estimated by implementing the hybrid learning algorithm. Finally, the obtained outputs are used to prioritize the blockchain technology adoption enablers using the fuzzy data envelopment analysis model. The result of this study implies that the blockchain technology can have a significant impact on mineral supply chain performance by creating smart contracts and enhancing environmental sustainability, traceability, and transparency.},

	abstract = {With peer-to-peer software technologies based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts, automated negotiation of client-server relationships for enterprise networking and project-oriented fractal organizations can now be readily implemented. To this aim, the distributed (emergent) schedule of client-server contracts must be a Nash equilibrium from which any agent finds no incentive to deviate. Also, to respond effectively to unplanned events and disturbances, the renegotiating process of all concerned client-server contracts must pursue a new Nash equilibrium solution in the face of incomplete information by each individual agent. In this work, distributed multi-project (re)scheduling is formulated as a repeated-negotiation game in a multi-agent setting where each agent resorts to decoupled learning rules for deciding the terms and conditions in each contract settlement. After a finite number of stages of the negotiation game, a new emergent schedule close to a Nash equilibrium is found. An agent-based simulation framework is proposed to implement the repeated negotiation game based on bilateral client-server contracts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study of a project-oriented fractal company in the pharmaceutical industry. Simulation results obtained highlight that repeated negotiations and decoupled learning are key for approaching a Nash equilibrium and welfare solutions to a (re)scheduling problem.},

Although multi-party cooperation detection methods can be applied to improve efficiency, common crowdsourcing models are difficult to guarantee the privacy of code and identity. We design a code and identity privacy vulnerability crowdsourcing detection system ConGradetect. The system is built on a blockchain and solves code privacy issues, identity privacy issues, and reward preemption issues during the crowdsourcing detection process of vulnerabilities. In ConGradetect, users have a dynamic fake identity, which ensures that the identity of the user is not exposed, thereby avoiding the problem of information exposure caused by data accumulation. In the meantime, ConGradetect uses a local code granulation tool to perform off-line code cutting for task publishers, and uses proxy re-encryption to allocate task code blocks to ensure that the complete original code is only known to the code owner. When the task is received, a trusted key conversion is performed using smart contract. Further, we propose a method for anonymous verification of the binding relationship between task and user to prevent reward preemption and ensure that task performers can obtain corresponding legal benefits. Finally, we run the system on the Ethereum blockchain and test its performance. After testing, the feasibility of ConGradetect is proved.},

	abstract = {Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96\% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18\% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85\% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.},

	abstract = {Blockchain cloud manufacturing is an emerging service-oriented paradigm that takes many advantages to cloud manufacturing. Previous researchers have studied from eradicating third party trust problem among service providers and customers by decentralized data record and involving smart contract. However, the existing paradigm still suffers from third party trust problem among service-related participants and cloud manufacturing provider since service is solely managed by cloud manufacturing provider without supervision and service related participants cannot know whether composed service provision which indeed is NP-hard problem is optimal. In this paper, the architecture of blockchain cloud manufacturing system is proposed with adoption of several cloud manufacturing providers and vote mechanism to vote for optimal composed service provision on candidate composed service scheme firstly calculated by one cloud manufacturing provider. According to customer satisfaction-based service match and quality control, a system framework of composed service performance evaluation is desifned to incorporate the vote mechanism. Firstly, customer satisfaction dimensions as evaluation dimensions are extracted from customer text reviews based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and sub-dimensions under each customer satisfaction dimension are set up based on professional field knowledge. Secondly, overall customer satisfaction rating of reviews and sentiment of reviews towards customer satisfaction dimensions are analysed by three score scheme, bag of words (BOW) and support vector machine (SVM) classification. Thirdly, the sentiment effect and category of customer satisfaction dimension on overall customer satisfaction are identified with the application of neural network and Kano model. Fourthly, in consideration of category characteristic, overall performance of customer satisfaction dimension is measured as distance and using proposed Logit-SVM method. Service selection standard according to value of customer satisfaction is set up. Finally, one empirical study is presented to verify the feasibility of proposed system framework, and proposed model is further discussed.},

Although many research works have been devoted to solving the problem of entity authentication for cross-domain communication, the problem of “incomplete cross-domain” widely exists in existing works. Existing solutions based on some common underlying cryptography foundations greatly limit the application of such cross-domain authentication schemes. In order to solve the problem of “incomplete cross-domain”, this paper proposes a thoroughly cross-domain authentication scheme based on blockchain technology, which can be used by participants from different domains that adopt totally different settings. Our security analysis demonstrates that the scheme is provably secure in the standard model and the experimental results show the efficiency of our scheme.},

	abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.},

The design of threshold traceability of anonymous transactions allows network members to trace transactions back to the sender without violating the decentralized property of blockchain. In AttriChain, the spontaneous tracing of misbehaviors in the network distributes the power of identity governance to multiple independent tracing members instead of depending on single-point management. It significantly increases user privacy and autonomy in a permissioned network and facilitates auditing at the same time. We define the functionality and the protocol of AttriChain in the universal composable model. We also provide an implementation of an AttriChain prototype for performance analysis.},

In this paper, we use a Markov state machine to model selfish and stubborn mining in an imperfect Ethereum network with natural forks. The security threshold against selfish mining, which indicates how difficult an attacker could gain more than he deserves, decreases to 23.8\% in an uncle block rate of 11\%. Two advanced selfish mining strategies, trail stubborn mining and equal fork combined with trail stubborn mining, are also analyzed with different uncle block rates in this paper. In different feasible regions, strategies that bring about the optimal reward vary from each other.

However, providing blockchain-based solutions compatible with energy trading is not an easy task, where real-world feasibility for business model, blockchain configuration, and physic limitations is rather to be investigated. In this work, a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain is leveraged to implement real-world applications for energy trading in a smart community. A near-real-time bilateral trading scheme, directly negotiated on a peer-to-peer basis without any intermediary, is designed for achieving supply–demand balance within power network limits. Thenceforward, the specific process of the HF blockchain establishment and the smart contract creation for system initialization, registration, negotiation, trading, balancing and settlement, are detailed demonstrated. In addition, the benchmark is presented to test the performance metrics of execution time, latency, throughput for feasibility and scalability analyses in real-world application. The results illustrate the proposed HF-assisted energy trading platform corroborates the feasibility for the future scalable P2P trading.},

However, there are some issues still waiting to be solved, e.g. privacy of energy data, asynchrony of households’ desire and incomplete understanding of its operation features, etc. These issues may hinder its further application and development. To address these requirements, a research to analyze the characteristics of a typical peer-to-peer energy sharing community model is carried out. The model is built on the basis of the proof of credit consensus in blockchain technology and Shapley value in game theory. A two-level hierarchical incentive mechanism is proposed to motivate participants to obey the energy smart contract and involve in electricity peak-shifting. A series of indexes are applied to evaluate the operation performance of the proposed model, from the aspects of the economy, technique, environment and market efficiency. The validity of the incentive mechanism and the proposed model are verified, and the impacts of important factors, i.e. community scale and prosumer ratio, on the proposed model are assessed. This work would provide reference to the constructors of future peer-to-peer energy market about arranging the optimal appliance scale and distributed energy resources ratio to make it become more friendly, efficient and economical.},

	abstract = {Intuitive context-aware algorithms called "Next Basket recommender systems" improve consumers' decision-making by offering suggestions for potential products they might like to buy next based on their past behaviour. Even though it is now well-known, this field is still young. Many different industries, such as e-commerce and healthcare, employ recommender systems. Even though these datasets frequently contain sensitive data, most recommender systems place a greater emphasis on the models' accuracy than on their security and privacy. We investigate this concept in the context of the sequential recommendation job known as Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), whose objective is to provide a user with a selection of goods based on their purchasing behaviour. A recent state-of-the-art technology is blockchain. Blockchain creates a trusted environment without the involvement of a third party, thus ensuring privacy and security. It is designed in such a way that it is enough in itself to create trust. In this paper, we propose and assimilate an authentic blockchain privacy system for a fortified user recommendation system for the Next Basket Recommendation. With next basket proposals based on blockchain for safe transactions and distributed context-based processing, this suggested system enables the development of decentralized RSs. Through the use of atomic swaps on the blockchain, this effort aims to provide viable solutions that can lead to fair procedures. It places a focus on effective data deletion procedures that preserve user privacy and transfers the issue of decremental learning to the Next Basket system, a more secure and wise recommendation. By incorporating blockchain into recommender systems (RSs), which contain smart contracts in the main blockchain-based RS protocol, it is feasible to create safe trust-based systems with the benefit of multi-party computation backed by blockchain. Additionally, it aids in protecting user information since blockchain enables the secure processing of customer data in online portals.},

This research aims to explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology (BCT) in marine plastic debris management. A case study on three pioneer recycling organizations is conducted based on secondary data. The study found that BCT can be applied to solve some of the existing challenges of marine plastic debris management. A digital token system and identity recognition mechanism based on BCT can increase the public awareness for marine plastic debris governance. The derived digital wallets and distributed ledgers can effectively replace paper documents and cash transactions in the traditional recycling chain, and minimize global impact on local economies, thus improve efficiency and safety. Also, the traceability and high transparency of blockchain and the application of smart contracts can effectively build a global recycling network. In addition, the application of BCT can greatly improve the transparency of recycling value chains, and make them more accepting of supervision from society and consumers. This research is one of the first studies on BCT in marine plastic debris management and explores worldwide pioneering companies. In practice, this study can help companies analyse the defects in their own waste disposal models and help practitioners make decisions to adopt BCT. In academia, as one of the early exploratory studies on the application of BCT to the treatment of marine plastic debris, this study provides further empirical reference on BCT based business models and recycling chains, and can guide future research in this field.},

Big data market can carry out efficient data trading, which provides a way to share data and further enhances the utility of data. However, to realize effective data trading in big data market, several challenges need to be resolved. The first one is to verify the data availability for a data consumer. The second is privacy of a data provider who is unwilling to reveal his real identity to the data consumer. The third is the payment fairness between a data provider and a data consumer with atomic exchange. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new blockchain-based fair data trading protocol in big data market. The proposed protocol integrates ring signature, double-authentication-preventing signature and similarity learning to guarantee the availability of trading data, privacy of data providers and fairness between data providers and data consumers. We show the proposed protocol achieves the desirable security properties that a secure data trading protocol should have. The implementation results with Solidity smart contract demonstrate the validity of the proposed blockchain-based fair data trading protocol.},

This paper proposes a master-slave chain based trusted cross-domain authentication mechanism in IoT to improve the efficiency and credibility of authentication. In this system, a master-slave blockchain architecture supporting distributed cross-domain authentication is designed. Then, an improved Byzantine Fault Tolerance based on reputation value model (RIBFT)is proposed for trusted authentication and data traceability. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively improve the efficiency and credibility of authentication for IoT devices.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46\% uniqueness and 2.38\% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

Semi-structured interviews with industry experts are employed to elaborate on promising practices for the industry to efficiently promote blockchain adoption and meaningful research directions for scholars.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows virtual disintermediation and automatization of property transactions, which might help to design future platforms, intended to facilitate cross-border transactions within the EU and worldwide. To this end, users of these blockchain-based platforms may create the so-called “digital tokens” or “colored coins” that aim to represent rights over different types of “real world” assets. By transferring a digital token, the parties aim to transfer the ownership or other property rights over the asset represented by the token without the intervention of traditional intermediaries, such as real estate conveyancers, land registrars or notaries specializing in real estate. However, this new technological tool raises several questions in the field of private law, such as the legal nature of the token, how the effective transfer of the property rights operates or how ownership rules may be applied in this decentralized environment (e.g. rights and duties of the token holder). Some of the issues at stake have only been tentatively addressed by both lawmakers and academia. In light of this research gap, this paper addresses these controversial issues from both a private law and a comparative perspective, and proposes a model to tokenize the right of usufruct over chattels and real estate, analyzing its legal viability and limitations across six jurisdictions. The paper concludes that private law rules may be adapted to the tokenization of property rights, which may contribute to the establishment of a digital market for the trading of asset-backed tokens worldwide.},

	abstract = {Forecasting precise water usage corresponding to various beneficial usages is important for optimal and sustainable planning and management of water resources. Due to rapid population growth, there is an urgent need for devising water saving solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based incentivized edge computing framework for water saving using soft computing methodologies. The framework facilitates decision makers in creating awareness among people about water savings in a easily understandable scientific way. Our incentivized blockchain based model uses edge computing at the house nodes of the network to predict the actual usage of a particular household in the locality based on several factors such as number of people, average income of family, profession of the members and previous water demands. By using Feed Forward Networks and Mixture Density Networks, we predict the water usage in terms of input factors and historical usage respectively, thus incorporating machine computing into the framework. With the two values from these methods, a comparison is made with the actual amount of water used by the householders. This research proposes deployment of the smart contract on the blockchain network for efficient and accurate reward distribution. Incentives and rewards are given in the blockchain network to houses with lesser consumption and penalties are imposed when usage crosses predicted and historic usage. The model ensures that accurate incentives are provided to the people in order to motivate them to avoid wastage of water. Results show that the methods used in our work perform better than other relevant networks on a self-synthesized dataset. The proposed methods converge well and show higher spatio-temporal accuracy.},

However, this has also presented new challenges and requirements for cybersecurity, data analytics, and computational complexity for Data-Driven Fault-Tolerant Controllers (DD-FTC) in smart factories. To address these issues, a Blockchain-Based Data-Driven Fault-Tolerant Control (BB-DD-FTC) framework for smart factories is proposed in this paper. Blockchain ensures the integrity of data logs via its immutable ledger and decentralized architecture. Moreover, the blockchain smart contract functionality, embedded with a Data-Driven Intrusion Detection System (DD-IDS), and reconfiguration conditions, realizes DD-FTC and undertakes the mitigation response in case of cyber-attacks. The DD-IDS mechanism utilizes the principal component analysis technique and observer models, trained via neural networks, to detect an attack and identify the compromised component. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) industrial benchmark process is considered a case study to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. Two kinds of integrity attacks are applied to the sensors of the TE process with simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in mitigating the adversarial effect of the applied attacks on the overall system performance. As feedback delays can negatively impact performance, a detailed delay analysis is performed using network calculus. The security advantages and limitations of the proposed method are finally highlighted in the performed security analysis. The results are encouraging for the wider adoption of the control-over-the-blockchain concept.},

Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users’ privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.},

	abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is considered to be one of the most suitable schemes for cryptographic access control in the big data environment. But it still faces many challenges to be applied in the Internet of Things (IoT). ABE is implemented based on bilinear pairing, which is considered to be an expensive operation. However, there are lots of IoT devices with constrained resources. Proxy re-encryption methods based on the cloud are proposed to reduce computing overhead on the user side, but an untrusted cloud may give incorrect computing results to mislead users. To solve this problem, an access control scheme with lightweight decryption based on ABE and blockchain technologies is proposed. We assume that the cloud is untrusted, and guarantee the accuracy of proxy re-encryption calculation based on blockchain. In addition, how to encourage users to obtain authorization through blockchain and record access behavior on the blockchain is a problem worthy of attention. This paper proposes a user credibility incentive mechanism, which calculates the user’s credibility according to the user’s access behavior and gives a reputation score, so as to dynamically adjust the endorsement protocol.

	abstract = {The high energy consumption of HPC systems is an obstacle for ever-growing systems. Unfortunately, energy consumption does not decrease linearly with reduced workload; therefore, energy conservation techniques have been deployed on various levels which steer the overall system. While the overall saving of energy is useful, the price of energy is not necessarily proportional to the consumption. Particularly with renewable energies, there are occasions in which the price is significantly lower. The potential of saving energy costs when using smart contracts with energy providers is lacking research. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the potential savings when applying cost-aware schedulers to data center workloads while considering power contracts that allow for dynamic (hourly) pricing. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) the theoretic assessment of cost savings; (2) the development of a simulator to replay batch scheduler traces which supports flexible energy cost models and various cost-aware scheduling algorithms. This allows to approximate the energy costs savings of data centers for various scenarios including off-peak and hourly budgeted energy prices as provided by the energy spot market. An evaluation is conducted with four annual job traces from the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ). The theoretic analysis indicates a cost savings for 4–8\% when shutting down unused client nodes, and 6–20\% with hourly cost models and optimal scheduling. The experimental validation of a practicable scheduler increases the accuracy against the theoretical best case analysis. As expected, a cost-efficient scheduling algorithm that is fed with the information about future energy costs shifts the jobs to the timeslots where the job execution is cheaper and reduces the energy expenditure, yet increases the waiting times of pending jobs. However, the expected savings for this effort are not justifiable compared to the simple strategy of turning off the unused nodes. Additionally, we compare the cost savings to the total costs of ownership showing that smaller systems with on-demand provisioning yield better cost efficiency.},

This paper presents a novel semantic differential transaction (SDT) approach to minimizing information redundancy in the nascent field of BIM and blockchain integration. Whereas the conventional thinking is to store an entire BIM model or its signature code in blockchain, SDT captures local model changes as SDT records and assembles them into a BIM change contract (BCC). In this way, the version history of a BIM project becomes a chain of timestamped BCCs, and stakeholders can promptly synchronize BIM changes in blockchain. We test our approach in two pilot cases. The results show that SDT captures, in near real time, sequential and simultaneous BIM changes at {\textless}0.02\% of the Industry Foundation Classes file size. We also prove model restoration from the lightweight BCCs in a small-scale BIM project. In addressing the fundamental issue of information redundancy in BIM and blockchain integration, this research can help the industry advance beyond the rhetoric to develop operable blockchain BIM systems.},

	abstract = {Business Process Management provides concepts for enterprises to design, document and execute their business processes. Involved artefacts establish the basis for a profound enhancement of processes, like performance improvements or a substantiate assignment of employees (resources) to tasks. These artefacts comprise process models for documentation purposes or Workflow Management Systems for executing processes. Those concepts are adopted well within single companies but are barely implemented for inter-organizational processes reasoned in a lack of trust between participating business partners. For instance, questions like who the host of the workflow engine is and thus have sovereignty over the process execution remains open. Besides expensive third parties, we believe that Blockchain Technology bears potential to solve the lack of trust due to automated consensus finding. We present a Blockchain-based process engine guaranteeing a tamper-proof execution, which is both, highly scalable regarding the size of process models as well as capable of considering employees captured in the organizational perspective of the process model. Comparable approaches suffer from lack of trustworthiness either, are not applicable for large process models, or do not include organizational concerns.},
