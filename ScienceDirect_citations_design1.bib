	abstract = {The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.},

	abstract = {The Energy Community Platform (ECP) is a modular system conceived to promote a conscious use of energy by the users inside local energy communities. It is composed of two integrated subsystems: the Energy Community Data Platform (ECDP), a middleware platform designed to support the collection and the analysis of big data about the energy consumption inside local energy communities, and the Energy Community Tokenization Platform (ECTP), which focuses on tokenizing processed source data to enable incentives through smart contracts hosted on a decentralized infrastructure possibly governed by multiple authorities. We illustrate the overall design of our system, conceived considering some real-world projects (dealing with different types of local energy community, different amounts and nature of incoming data, and different types of users), analyzing in detail the key aspects of the two subsystems. In particular, the ECDP acquires data of a different nature in a heterogeneous format from multiple sources and supports a data integration workflow and a data lake workflow, designed for different uses of the data. We motivate our technological choices and present the alternatives taken into account, both in terms of software and of architectural design. On the other hand, the ECTP operates a tokenization process via smart contracts to promote good behaviors of users within the local energy community. The peculiarity of this platform is to allow external parties to audit the correct behavior of the whole tokenization process while protecting the confidentiality of the data and the performance of the platform. The main strengths of the presented system are flexibility and scalability (guaranteed by its modular architecture), which allow its applicability to any type of local energy community.},

	abstract = {The emission trading systems (ETSs) have encouraged the more usage of renewable energy, aiming for energy generation. However, the existing ETSs suffer from carbon credit scams, poor monitoring, verification and reporting (MRV), participants’ unwillingness and non-transparent trading. To address these issues, we propose a trustworthy and incentivized emission trading system using hyperledger (a permissioned blockchain) and smart contracts. It assures a transparent trading of carbon credits (CC) with better MRV. It applies three smart contracts viz; CC selling, CC buying and CC trading to achieve reliable and secure transactions of the energy trading with the improved trust. For emission trading, we propose a priority based auction, in which priority to CC sellers is assigned based on their carbon credits, while priority to CC buyers is assigned based on their reputation. This strategy rewards the participants for their efforts towards avoiding the deforestification and the use of renewable energy. In addition, it is incentivized for both CC buyers as well as sellers, and thus, it encourages more number of participants. The proposed system satisfies more than 84.37\% bids with minimum transaction latency (0.41 s) and sufficient throughput (102.42 tps). In addition, multi-criteria analysis using different statistical methods is performed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the proposed systems.},

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper.},

Smart contracts extend the capabilities of the Blockchain, but the strict gas policy of the EVM limits the implementation of various DApps. On the other hand, Oracle provides a means to use an external execution environment for smart contracts, but its functional limitations and additional costs limit the growth of the DApp market to DApp users. To address the gas consumption crisis of DApps, we designed an event-based resource offloading solution that allows DApp developers to run their own compute servers. By adopting our solution, DApp users only pay the constant and minimized amount of gas fee, while the external server pays highly reduced amount of gas fee instead. We describe the solution in detail with a sample DApp model and mathematically demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution compared to an Oracle-based implementation. Furthermore, we conducted empirical experiment of actual DApp using EVM and verified the reduction of the gas consumption.},

Objective We aim at addressing the site availability issue on a hierarchical network by designing an immutable/transparent/source-verifiable quorum mechanism. Methods We developed an approach to combine a hierarchical learning algorithm, a novel Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) consensus protocol, and a design of blockchain smart contracts. We constructed QuorumChain as an example and evaluated the scenarios of site-unavailability during the initialization and/or iteration phases of the modeling process on three healthcare/genomic datasets. Results When one or more sites would become unavailable, HierarchicalChain could not function, whereas QuorumChain improved predictive correctness significantly (the full Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, or AUC, improved from 0.068 to 0.441, all with p-values {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion By constructing a quorum to continue the modeling process, QuorumChain possesses the capability to tackle the situation of sites being unavailable. It inherits the capability of learning on network-of-networks, improves learning continuity, and provides data/software immutability, transparency, and provenance, which can be important in expediting clinical research.},

	abstract = {Smart contract security has drawn extensive attention in recent years because of the enormous economic losses caused by vulnerabilities. Even worse, fixing bugs in a deployed smart contract is difficult, so developers must detect security vulnerabilities in a smart contract before deployment. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection efforts heavily rely on fixed rules defined by experts, which are inefficient and inflexible. To overcome the limitations of existing vulnerability detection approaches, we propose a GNN based approach for smart contract vulnerability detection. First, we construct a graph representation for a smart contract function with syntactic and semantic features by combining abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and program dependency graph (PDG). To further strengthen the presentation ability of our approach, we perform program slicing to normalize the graph and eliminate the redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities. Then, we use a Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural-Network model with hybrid attention pooling to identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contract functions. Empirical results show that our approach can achieve 89.2\% precision and 92.9\% recall in smart contract vulnerability detection on our dataset and reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

	abstract = {A fair contract signing scheme ensures that contract signing participants can fairly exchange the digital signatures of the contract, which has a wide range of applications on the Internet. Verifiable Encrypted Signature (VES) can be used as a fair exchange mechanism for digital signatures, in which it requires a centralized Trusted Third Party (TTP) as an adjudicator. However, there are many security challenges with the centralized TTP. For example, it may disclose the contents of the contract, collude with others, or even occurs a service interruption. To address those problems, in this paper, we propose a two-party fair contract signing scheme based on Ethereum smart contract, which allows participants to fairly perform the contract signing procedures on the blockchain. Specifically, we propose a modified VES scheme in which no centralized adjudicator is needed. Then we design the fair contract signing scheme based on the modified VES scheme. We leverage the Ethereum smart contract technology to ensure fairness, which has the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability, autonomy, efficiency, and tampering resistant. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is secure and feasible.},

	abstract = {The advent of fog computing as an extension of cloud-enabling technology has moved from the hub of the internet framework to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled control and management of drone-based data. The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03\% and increase the performance up to 73.11\%, thus decreasing the cost of drone-ledger preservation down to 30.13\% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29\% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .},

Relying on the blockchain only leads to problems such as increase in application response time, chain size, and a high computational cost due to the increase in data storage in blockchain and thus increase the service costs to end users. Additionally, the blockchain lacks to scalability of data because of the inability to store large-sized data and accommodate the grows of ride-sharing data. To overcome these problems, a novel decentralized ride-sharing system that exploits blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is proposed. The goal of the proposed system is to move all ride-sharing data outside the blockchain and replacing it with a small hash. The blockchain manages the application state and users. In addition, it automates processes through smart contracts. While the IPFS stores data for blockchain in immutable and integral way. Wherefore, the proposed ride-sharing system integrates IPFS with blockchain for RSSs to retain the provided assurance by the blockchain and provide efficient service to end users. Experimental results proved the applicability and efficiency of RSS based on blockchain and IPFS which provides efficient storage of ride-sharing data, immutable history, and generally better efficiency in a decentralized manner.},

	abstract = {In order to have transactions executed and recorded on blockchains such as the Ethereum Mainnet, fees expressed in crypto-currency units of the blockchain must be paid. One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max–min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max–min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low transaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm.},

	abstract = {We consider a newsvendor setting where the newsvendor elicits a demand forecast from an expert to determine the optimal inventory level for a product. Since the interests of both parties might not be aligned, we propose a proper scoring rule to elicit the expert's forecast that is tailored to the decision problem the newsvendor faces. Under the proposed scoring rule, both the newsvendor's expected profit and the expert's expected payment increase as the expert exerts a higher effort when gathering information to formulate a forecast. Trust issues arise in this setting because the ex post payment the expert receives is contingent on the accuracy of the reported forecast, which in turn depends on a future realized outcome that might be only available to the newsvendor. We show that coding the proposed proper scoring rule as a blockchain-based smart contract allows the newsvendor to signal trustworthiness while, at the same time, inducing the expert to devote more effort in information gathering. Following the design science research framework, we conclude the paper by suggesting a design and a fully functional prototype of a blockchain-based smart contract that implements the proposed tailored proper scoring rule.},

	abstract = {The problem of efficient energy consumption in buildings is becoming increasingly prominent with the rapid development of the global economy. The application of distributed energy introduces new solutions for energy conservation in buildings. Hence, residents can use and store clean energy to reduce the amount of electricity they buy from the grid, thereby reducing energy consumption. However, the traditional centralised aggregator approach has many disadvantages, including malicious node attacks, difficult dispatching, high transmission consumption and high operation cost. The day-ahead smart contract has been innovatively designed in this paper to enable the collaborative decision of participants on the day-ahead dispatch plan and subsequently ensure the forecast monitoring during the next day. In addition, the intraday smart contract can autonomously realise multilateral transactions based on reputation value and billing autonomously. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach can reduce the cost of distributed energy dispatching.},

	abstract = {With the concerns of environment protection, electric vehicle (EV) is regarded as a promising transportation tool for green cities project. Since the amount of EV is rising shapely, the EV charging demands is also rapidly generated. However, seeking suitable charging facilities is not easy for EV users, new energy companies run charging station separately for self-interests, and charging pile information is not transparent for drivers. This dilemma is not solved until the merging of blockchain technology. In this paper, a novel EV charging system is proposed for the cooperation of new energy companies and providing convenient charging services for users. In this system, charging information is managed and recorded by the company alliance based on consortium blockchain, which is tamper-resistant and multi-centralized. Meanwhile, a new smart contract is designed to balance the allocation of company’ charging users, so that the profits of different new energy companies could be fairer. To equilibrate the interest of companies and EV users, a Bio-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming model (BOMILP) is proposed as the mathematical logic of smart contracts. Furthermore, we proposed a new algorithm named Limited Neighborhood Search with Memory (LNSM) to support the implementation of smart contracts, which could make the smart contract running faster and has a better performance. At last, the proposed EV charging system and the smart contract are validated through a real case study with the EV charging data in Beijing, China.},

In this paper, we first design a token-based access control mechanism for smart contracts with dynamic adjustment of the access control rules (ACRs), which guarantees that only authorized users can trigger and execute specific smart contracts. We then propose an intrusion detection mechanism for smart contracts to detect attacks against smart contracts in an effective and real-time way. Based on these mechanisms, we propose an access control and intrusion detection framework, dubbed ACID, to resist various attacks while remaining all characteristics and functionalities of the underlying blockchain-based SATCOM system.

	abstract = {The current Distribution Grid Automation (DGA) Systems are being heavily dependent on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for its proper operation. The DGA architectures are predominantly centralized and usually deployed on a dedicated hardware. This increases the risk of blackouts under a coordinated cyber-physical attack. The compromise of the dedicated hardware that hosts the central coordinator of the DGA automation results in a blackout. Though many countermeasures have already been proposed for tackling different types cyber and physical attacks on the ICT infrastructure, very few measures have been proposed to ensure the availability of the grid operation functions, even when it is compromised. This study proposes an automatic, distributed approach based on Blockchain and Smart Contract that ensures the availability of the core DGA functions even if the central coordinator that operates the grid is compromised. This is done by virtualizing and migrating/re-initialising these functions from the dedicated hardware that was compromised to another. Additionally, a Multi-Attribute Decision Making based method is incorporated into the Smart Contract that helps in selection of the optimal hardware that can host the function considering its limitations (hardware and software). Finally, a proof of concept implementation of the proposed solution is presented that utilizes the Calvin IoT (Internet of Things) platform, Flow programming tool and Hyperledger fabric and its performance is evaluated.},

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, more and more applications are developed for running on a distributed ledger technology, namely dApps. The business logic of dApps is usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii) assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants. On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption perspective. An experiment involving 2186 smart contracts demonstrates that the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code segments that need optimizations.},

Many web service providers also provide some options for users to control the data. However, it is still a challenge to investigate how they enforce these actions. There is a need to deploy additional measures to secure the data access. Focused on this challenge, in this work, we design a scheme that uses smart contract and blockchain to provide a secure data sharing and access environment. In our scheme, there are three major parties and each of them has its own key pair for encrypting and signing the data. We also develop four main smart contracts for different parties, and discuss what kinds of data should be immutable and placed on-chain. In the evaluation, we explore the performance of our scheme under different platforms such as Ethereum with EtHash, Ethereum with Clique, and Hyperledger. With the analysis of several potential attacks, our results indicate the viability and effectiveness of our scheme.},

	abstract = {Context: A large number of Ethereum smart contracts have been deployed on blockchain to manage assets. Unfortunately, due to the immutable nature of blockchain, smart contracts cannot be modified after deployment, even if vulnerabilities have been exposed to attackers. Therefore, it is critical to efficiently and thoroughly test smart contracts. Greybox fuzzing is a prosperous technique for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. However, most existing fuzzers have a common drawback in that they cannot efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. Objective: The goal of this paper is to solve the problem of how to efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. After solving this problem, fuzz testing can execute more code, and there is a higher probability of executing vulnerabilities. Method: We propose an approach for addressing this problem. Specifically, we design an input parameter analysis strategy to selectively mutate a subset of input parameters to reduce invalid mutations. Also, to accelerate the processing of satisfying branch constraints, we design an accelerated multi-objective search strategy to reduce the waste of resources. Result: We implemented this approach in a tool called Effuzz and applied it to real-world smart contracts. Experiments show that Effuzz finds more vulnerabilities and is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art fuzzers. Conclusion: In this paper, we present an approach to efficiently satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints. Our approach addresses two main problems, i.e., how to select the subset of input parameters for mutation with considering the characteristic of Ethereum smart contracts, and how to accelerate the search to satisfy hard-to-cover branch constraints without generating excessive ineffective test cases that waste resources. The experimental results show that our approach is effective.},

Blockchain can provide technical solutions for trust issues between manufacturing service providers and demanders, but less research has focused on the stable maintenance of a blockchained shared manufacturing network (BSMN). Industrial knowledge graph and cognitive intelligence play an important role in designing incentive mechanisms for BSMN. Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper designs various incentive models and develops the corresponding smart contracts to encourage different enterprises to participate in the “accounting” operations, to enhance the trust and maintain the operational stability of BSMN. Firstly, the evolution mechanism of BSMN was analyzed. Then, an evolutionary game model between shared manufacturing enterprise nodes was established to deduce the stable state of BSMN. Based on the analysis of the evolutionarily stable state, an incentive model with three strategies to encourage different enterprise nodes to participate in “accounting” operations was determined, and smart contracts of the incentive models were developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive models was verified by simulation experiments.},

Existing research efforts tend to focus on pre-tests or are not capable of dynamically protecting the deployed contracts without impacting on the availability of the contracts. Thus in this paper, we propose and implement a high-availability and unified input Filter-based Secure Framework for Ethereum smart Contract (hereafter referred to as FSFC). FSFC is designed to allow the deployed smart contracts to continue running normally even when faced with potential attacks (due to vulnerability exploitation). Specifically, the proposed approach allows one to dynamically identify and discard bad inputs before getting processed. In other words, the owner can protect the contract by deploying filters through FSFC, regardless of the vulnerability discovered in the deployed contract, and without suspending the contract service. We also evaluate the security of FSFC. Then, using integer vulnerability as a case study, we demonstrate how FSFC can be deployed and evaluate its utility using real-world smart contracts with known integer vulnerability. For example, a comparative summary demonstrates that in comparison to the plain Geth, FSFC only incurs minimal additional overhead for the miners and less than 2\% extra gas consumption for normal users.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.},

	abstract = {The language barrier is the biggest obstacle for users watching foreign-language videos. Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker's revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.},

Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.},

	abstract = {Devices and edges of the Internet of Things (IoT) are working together to broaden the sensing capability of the IoT. The protection of personal sensory information privacy in the smart home has gotten more attention. To enable secure data sharing under the scenario of the smart home, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been applied widely. As a general rule, the sophisticated calculation of ABE is difficult under resource-constrained devices. The appearance of edge computing alleviates this dilemma, where an edge server (ES) is responsible for computing all heavy cryptographic operations and uploading massive device data to a cloud. Nevertheless, the ES and the cloud may be attacked artificially in reality. Accordingly, to check the correctness of the ES data and the integrity of the cloud data, we design a lightweight dual auditing scheme, where the first adopts the aggregation of data blocks and signatures to check the integrity of the cloud data, and the second constructs an efficient Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof to verify the correctness of the ES data in a lightweight way. To prevent collusion attacks, the legitimacy of the data user is authenticated by a smart contract. The simulation experiment shows that our multiple auditing scheme is relatively efficient.},

	abstract = {The crowd's power, combined with the sensing capabilities of smart mobile de-vices, has resulted in the emergence of a revolutionary data acquisition paradigm known as Mobile Crowdsensing. In exchange for rewards, mobile users collect and share location-specific data values. However, most existing crowdsensing systems built on traditional centralized architectures are highly prone to attacks, intrusions, single point of failure, manipulations, and low reliability. Recently, decentralized blockchain technologies are being applied in mobile crowdsensing systems to ensure workers' privacy, data privacy, and the quality of sensed data at a low service fee. By leveraging blockchain technology, this paper inherits the advantages of the public blockchain without the need for any trusted third-parties. We propose a smart contract-based privacy-preserving data aggregation and quality assessment protocol to infer reliable aggregated results and estimate data quality, wherein, we design a fair quality-driven incentive mechanism to distribute rewards based on the data quality. The protocol ensures a secure, cost-optimal, and reliable aggregation and estimation of the sensed data quality on the public blockchain without disclosing the sensed data's and participants' privacy. We adopt Interplanetary File Systems to offset the blockchain's expensive storage costs. Experiments were conducted using real-world datasets which were implemented on a full-stack on-chain and off-chain decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate our design is highly efficient in achieving privacy-preserving data aggregation and significantly reduces on-chain computation costs.},

	abstract = {This paper explores and demonstrates the innovation potential of blockchain and smart contracts for supply chain finance (SCF) based on cross-border beef supply chains from Australia to China. Our study adopts mechanism design and design-driven activities, and specifically employs the Agents Events Data (AED) process mapping method, which is a hybrid approach that combines Business Process Redesign (BPR) and the Resources Events Assets (REA) accounting model. The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and “traditional” SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buy-side demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of E-commerce, more and more people are used to shopping online, in which the reputation scores of sellers play an important role in helping consumers purchase satisfactory products. However, in the existing E-commerce environments, the reputation scores of users (including sellers and buyers) are centrally computed and stored on a centralized cloud server, which might make errors or even engage in fraud and forgery. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system (BC-DRS) in the E-commerce environment, i.e., online shopping. In this system, the product information including product descriptions and comments is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the corresponding address is returned, and the returned address and the reputation scores of users are stored on the blockchain. The reputation evaluation is implemented by designing and deploying a smart contract on the blockchain. Different from the traditional centralized reputation systems (CRSs), the proposed BC-DRS can protect the product information and users reputation scores from intentional and unintentional modifications, since it is very hard to change any data stored in the blockchain and IPFS. Also, as the reputation scores of users are computed and updated by all the ratings of their transactions weighted by the practical transaction factors, it is effective to resist the common attacks, i.e., unfair rating and collusion. In addition, this system also contains a monetary incentive mechanism for the evaluation, which is helpful to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed BC-DRS is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed BC-DRS has desirable usability and reliability.},

	abstract = {An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.},

In this study, unlike the existing literature, a blockchain-based solution is developed for local cargo networks. With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts. In addition, shipments equipped with RFID tags are automatically tracked and traceable using UHF-RFID antennas. The IoT data collected in the study are stored on a cloud-based server, which is a cost-effective solution. Smart contracts that enable communication between the parties are written in the Solidity language using the Ganache, Truffle and Metamask platforms.

In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures.

Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.},

In addition, there are complex rights retrieval and assignment problems in the medical device supply chain system, and the traditional Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model is no longer suitable for the actual application environment of the supply chain. This article combines the traditional RBAC model and the Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) model for access control management in the medical device supply chain to overcome the limitations abovementioned, taking advantage of the ABAC model’s flexibility to achieve granular and dynamic management of permissions, as also the RBAC model to simplify the permissions management of the entire system. Blockchain technology’s traceability, non-tampering, and decentralization features are essential to eliminate passive and inferior medical equipment sales activities, solving the problem of mutual mistrust and ‘Information Silo’ between the two sides of medical device transactions. The access control model is implemented in the blockchain’s smart contract, providing granular and dynamic authority management for the medical equipment supply chain and guaranteeing the security and privacy of medical device information in the supply chain. Three smart contracts on Hyperledger Fabric are designed for device management information, storage of implemented access control models, and implementation of access control policies. Experimental results show that the entire system is stable, ensuring high throughput and high security and promising.},

This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg game and Blockchain-based framework that enables consumer-centric decarbonization by automating iterative negotiations between policy makers and consumers or generators to reduce carbon emissions. This iterative negotiation is modeled as a Stackelberg game-theoretic problem, and securely facilitated by Blockchain technologies. The policy maker formulates carbon prices and monetary compensation rates to dynamically incentivize the carbon reduction, whereas consumers and generators schedule their power profiles to minimize bills and maximize profits of generation, respectively. The negotiating agreement is yielded by reaching a Stackelberg equilibrium. The exchanged information and controlling functions are realized by using smart contracts of Blockchain technologies. Case studies of GB power systems show that the proposed framework can incentivize 9\% more bill savings for consumers and 45.13\% more energy generation from renewable energy sources. As a consumer-centric decarbonization framework, it can at least reduce carbon emissions by 40\%.},

This research, guided by the design science approach, aimed to develop a blockchain-enabled framework for assuring the effectiveness of on-site safety inspection of tower cranes (OSITC). First, a literature review was conducted to identify OSITC challenges and blockchain potential. Then, a blockchain-based conceptual framework was provided, with two major components: smart contracts and the consensus process, being discussed. Finally, using the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, a prototype system was developed to instantiate and test the proposed framework. The findings suggest that the blockchain can protect the OSITC’s effectiveness by allowing safety inspections to be automatically executed via smart contracts and providing relevant stakeholders with trustworthy inspection records via consensus algorithms. This study provides a novel solution for tower crane safety management to construction researchers and practitioners, inspiring more discussions about blockchain technology.},

This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance. The response times for each key step of smart contract in the proposed scheme is between 0.41 s and 0.91 s.},

Cloud storage audit schemes can help data owner (DO) to confirm the integrity of their data, but the existing schemes still have some limitations. On one hand, the existing schemes assume that DO's terminal devices are computationally powerful enough to handle various operations in a timely manner. While in practice, the terminal devices probably are mobile phones, tablets and other devices with low computing power. On the other hand, the existing schemes rely on a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA), but it is not in line with real application scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit (BBPO-PA) scheme for low performance terminal devices. Firstly, we introduced a trusted proxy authorized by DO, which can process and upload DO's encrypted files. Secondly, we applied blockchain in our scheme and utilized smart contracts instead of untrusted TPA to improve the reliability and stability of audit results. Thirdly, we took advantage of an index table to ensure that our scheme can support dynamic data operation. Finally, security analysis revealed that our scheme is provably secure in random oracle model. Meanwhile, performance analysis demonstrated that our scheme is efficient and especially suitable for low performance terminal devices.},

	abstract = {With the development of communication 5G networks and technologies, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce. The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is a public, permissionless blockchain, with Ether as cryptocurrency, and with Turing-complete smart contracts to implement arbitrarily complex distributed applications. Correct operation of Ethereum relies on appropriately rewarding participating nodes (called miners) for the resources used to run the blockchain. In Ethereum the Used Gas determines the reward miners receive for executing a smart contract. If the Used Gas is proportional to the cost of executing a smart contract, irrespective of the platform used, then all miners are incentivized identically. In this paper we propose OpBench, a platform-independent benchmark framework for Ethereum, as a lightweight approach to determine if for operational code (opcodes) the rewarded Used Gas is proportional to the invested CPU time. We implement OpBench for PyEthApp (in Python), Go-Ethereum (in GoLang) and Parity (in Rust). From the experiments we conclude that Used Gas is not always proportional to the required CPU, with up to an order of magnitude difference between opcodes. We also conclude that for most opcodes Parity performs the best of the three clients and that preference for Linux or Windows depends on the chosen Ethereum client software.},

The commonly used decentralized bookkeeping mode, blockchain-based trading schemes can now realize uniform clearing of decentralized transactions with the help of smart contracts. However, there are still risks of excessive disclosure of information and privacy leakage caused by incomplete decentralization. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized optimization-based market clearing model, which can be applied on blockchain. The model has three advantages: ① limited access to the consumers’ or generators’ private data, ② convenient calculation methods that can be deployed on the smart contract and ③ pure decentralization to realize transparent on-chain market clearing. Moreover, considering the insufficient throughput of the existing blockchain, a blockchain network, which can process the quotation calculation in parallel with various sub-chains, is also designed to support the proposed market clearing model. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed models is validated and tested on the Ethereum private blockchain.},

	abstract = {User-centric data sharing is essential to encourage citizens' active participation in the digital economy. One key to smart cities, a form of digital economy, is the promotion of public use of citizen data. Nevertheless, it is not easy to utilize data without citizens’ consent. In this study, we take a technological approach to these issues. User-managed access (UMA) is a well-known framework for delegating resource access rights to others on the Internet. In UMA, authorization mechanisms are designed to be centralized so that resource owners can centrally manage access rights for various resources stored in different domains. However, the lack of transparency in the authorization mechanism is a barrier to its implementation in large-scale systems such as smart cities. In this study, we developed a blockchain-based cross-domain authorization architecture that enables a resource-sharing ecosystem in which organizations that wish to utilize data can freely trade with each other. The proposed architecture solves the transparency problem that conventional authorization systems have had by designing the authorization mechanism on blockchain technology. We implemented the proposed architecture as smart contracts and evaluated its processing performance. The resultant time required for delegating access rights and accessing resources was less than 500 ms. Furthermore, we found that the fluctuation in the processing time overhead was small. Based on these results, we conclude that performance degradation with the proposed architecture is minor.},

	abstract = {Every organization relies on a designed contract to manage the rules that guide and coordinate the activities within each organization. However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain’s features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable. We enhance this with a unique contract consolidation scheme to avoid redundancy. We utilize our proposed scheme to develop a uniquely transparent and fair workflow within organizations such as recruitment and employment leveraging blockchain-based oracle nodes. We extend this work to outsourced and sub-outsourced projects on the blockchain where an arbitration scheme is developed in multi-arbitration and multi-contracting scenarios. We also consider in our case in ex-facto situations. We tested our proposed blockchain-based idea over existing blockchain networks. Our results prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed idea.},

Such changes however do not sufficiently account for circumstances of hardship, or black-swan events such as COVID-19, whereby the relative losers of trading arrangements should continue to receive outcomes which are not only efficient, but also fair and resilient. We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities. Evaluation and feedback from the company is also considered.},

	abstract = {Existing platforms for collaborative BIM design have a centralized system architecture, which suffers cybersecurity risks of design data manipulation and denial of access, leading to a loss of data traceability, a decline in design productivity, and project delays. Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.},

The framework design was based on the engineering requirements of a distribution-scale market, including participant needs, expected market transactions, and the cybersecurity constructs required to support a fair, secure, and efficient market operation. It leverages the existing blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control management (including identification, authentication, and authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management (decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to blockchain-based transactive energy systems.

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing reliance on loot boxes by the video game industry has attracted scrutiny from consumer groups and regulators. For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.},

	abstract = {Cloud storage plays an important role in today’s cloud ecosystem. Increasingly clients tend to outsource their data to the cloud. In spite of its copious advantages, integrity has always been a significant issue. The audit method is commonly used to ensure integrity in cloud scenarios. However, traditional auditing schemes expect a third-party auditor (TPA), which is not always available in the real world. Also, the former scheme implies a limited pay-as-you-go service, as it requires the client to pay for the service in advance. In this paper, we aim to address the aforementioned drawback by adopting blockchain to replace TPA and designing a blockchain-based fair payment smart contract for public cloud storage auditing. In our system, data owner and cloud service provider (CSP) will run a blockchain-based smart contract. The contract ensures that the CSP is required to submit data possession proof regularly. The CSP gets paid only if the verification is passed; otherwise, it gets no remuneration but has to pay the penalties. To reduce the number of interactions in the execution of contract, we present the notion of non-interactive public provable data possession and design a blockchain-based smart contract for public cloud storage auditing based on this primitive.},

	abstract = {A smart contract is a computer program, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract. About 10\% of the security vulnerabilities in smart contracts are caused by misuse of codes without comments. Therefore, there is a need to design effective automatic code comment generation methods for smart contracts. In this study, we propose an information retrieval-based code comment generation method CCGIR for smart contracts. Since code clones are common in smart contract development, CCGIR finds the most similar code in the code repository and reuses its comment through an information retrieval approach from three aspects: semantic similarity, lexical similarity, and syntactic similarity of smart contract codes. We select a corpus, which contains 57,676 unique pairs of {\textless}method, comment{\textgreater} from 40,932 real-world smart contracts, as our experimental subject. Then we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that CCGIR can outperform nine state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three performance measures. Moreover, we perform a human study to further verify that CCGIR can generate higher quality comments. Finally, we find CCGIR can achieve promising performance on the other two code comment generation tasks (i.e., code comment generation for Java and code comment generation for Python). Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed method, we recommend researchers can use our proposed method as the baseline when evaluating their proposed novel code comment generation methods.},

Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control. Furthermore, the proposed medical blockchain can resist the potential Internet attack simulated by the formal verification. Thus, no leakage of patient identity occurs, and the tradeoff could be eliminated effectively without the modification of current hospital devices according to the simulation results.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has the characteristics of limited resources and wide range of points. Aiming at the problems of policy centralization and single point of failure in traditional access control schemes, a distributed access control method based on adaptive trust evaluation and smart contract is proposed to provide fine-grained, flexible and scalable authorization for IoT devices with limited resources. Firstly, a modular access control architecture with integrated blockchain is proposed to achieve hierarchical management of IoT devices. Secondly, an IoT trust evaluation model called AITTE based on adaptive fusion weights is designed to effectively improve the identification of illegal access requests from malicious nodes. Finally, an attribute-based access control model using smart contract called AACSC which is built, which consists of attribute set contract (ASC), registration contract (RC), state judgment contract (SJC), authority permission management contract (AMC), and access control contract (ACC). As experimental results show, the scheme can effectively solve the problem of access security in resource-constrained IoT environments. Moreover, it also ensures the reliability and efficiency of the access control implementation process.},

	abstract = {The rationality and scientific nature of the emission trading mechanism is the key to the effective implementation of environmental and economic policies. As far as China is concerned, there are phenomena such as information asymmetry, low supervision efficiency, and alienation of government and enterprise behaviors caused by the incomplete mechanism of emission trading in the practice of different pilots. The introduction of blockchain technology can innovate the traditional transaction model and form a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction and a trusted emission trading market. To this end, based on the current emission trading mechanism and the characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper couples the core technologies of blockchain with the functional requirements of application scenarios. Then, an innovative application framework is built based on the consortium blockchain Fabric from three aspects: emission trading supervision, secondary trading market construction, as well as emission trading incentive and punishment mechanisms. Technologies such as the consensus mechanism, smart contract, Merkle tree and asymmetric encryption are comprehensively applied in this process. In the construction of the blockchain framework of the secondary market for emission trading, institutional changes and innovations brought about by the blockchain at various levels are analyzed in terms of participants, transaction processes and the transaction scope. At the same time, smart contract functions and algorithms are designed for the purchase, transfer-out and trading of emission rights, and the operation business logic of the smart contract is analyzed. On the whole, this paper explores the application framework of blockchain technology in the field of emission trading at the macro level, and analyzes the application mechanism of the corresponding technologies of blockchain at each coupling point in the framework at the micro level. The collaborative analysis at the two levels shows that blockchain technology and the requirements of emission trading mechanism can be effectively coupled, and the application of blockchain technology can promote the effective supervision of enterprises' emission behavior, making the processes of the purchase, transfer and transaction of emission rights intelligent and automated, and providing technical support for cross-regional emission trading to reduce transaction costs and management complexity. In addition, the issuance of emission credits based on smart contract will be a new incentive for companies to actively participate in transactions. Based on the above analysis, this paper believes that the innovative application of blockchain technology is of great significance in the promotion of the market-based allocation of element of emission trading and the rational allocation of environmental resources. It will lead to a major breakthrough in the traditional trading system in terms of trading modes, forming a value transmission network of environmental resources between the government and polluters.},

	abstract = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security.},

	abstract = {Due to the uncertainty of the value of big data, it is difficult to directly give a reasonable price for big data. Auction is an effective method of distributing goods to the bidder with the highest valuation. Hence, the use of auction strategy can not only guarantee the interests of data sellers, but also conform to market principles. However, existing data auction mechanisms are centralized. It is hard to build trust among sellers, buyers and auctioneers. An open and anonymous online environment may cause entities involved in data auctions to collude to manipulate the results of data auctions. This will cause the price of auction data to fail to reach a fair and truthful level. Therefore, the first anti-collusion data auction mechanism based on smart contract is proposed. Through a well-designed anti-collusion data auction algorithm, mutual distrust and rational buyers and sellers safely participate in the data auction without a trusted third party. The data auction mechanism designed in the smart contract can effectively prevent collusion and realize the fairness and truthfulness of data auction. The webpack in the Truffle Boxes is used to implement the data auction mechanism, and the anti-collusion property of the mechanism has been verified. The source code of the smart contract has been uploaded to GitHub.},

Additionally, the government suggested a mobile application to control the health passport authenticity.

In this work, the main contribution is integrating a private Blockchain-based digital health passport to ensure high protection of sensitive information, security and privacy among all the actors (Government, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health, verifiers) that comply with the CNDP (National Commission for the Control of Personal Data Protection) and the Moroccan Law 09–08. In our proposed architectural framework solution, we identify two types of actors: authorized and unauthorized, to limit and control access to the citizens' personal information. Besides, to preserve individuals' privacy, we adopt on-chain and off-chain storage (Interplanetary File Systems IPFS). In our case, smart contracts improve security and privacy in the health passport verification process. Our system implementation describes the proposed solution to grant individual privacy.

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps.},

Firstly, the trusted distributed environment blockchain is adopted to replace the third-party server. In order to avoid the leakage of personal information, users register an anonymous identity on the blockchain. In addition, in order to solve the problem of user’s location privacy leakage caused by mutual deceiving behavior among users in distributed structure, a dummy location algorithm based on two-attribute decision is designed on smart contract. In this algorithm, the distance between each location and the user location and the historical query probability of each location are obtained by calculating the peripheral location. Then, different thresholds are set for each location and a cyclic filtering is carried out. As a result, an anonymous set is obtained that effectively protects the user’s location. Finally, the simulation experiment proves that the method can not only improve the efficiency of protecting user’s location privacy, but also has lower time and computation overhead.},

	abstract = {Access control is essential for the IoT environment to ensure that only approved and trusted parties are able to configure devices, access sensor information, and command actuators to execute activities. The IoT ecosystem is subject to various access control complications due to the limited latency between IoT devices and the Internet, low energy requirements of IoT devices, the distributed framework, ad-hoc networks, and an exceptionally large number of heterogeneous IoT devices that need to be managed. The motivation for this proposed work is to resolve the incurring challenges of IoT associated with management and access control security. Each IoT domain implementation has particular features and needs separate access control policies to be considered in order to design a secure solution. This research work aims to resolve the intricacy of policies management, forged policies, dissemination, tracking of access control policies, automation, and central management of IoT nodes and provides a trackable and auditable access control policy management system that prevents forged policy dissemination by applying Software Defined Network (SDN) and blockchain technology in an IoT environment. Integration of SDN and blockchain provides a robust solution for IoT environment security. Recently, smart contracts have become one of blockchain technology’s most promising applications. The integration of smart contracts with blockchain technology provides the capability of designing tamper-proof and independently verifiable policies. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable solution for implementing immutable, verifiable, adaptive, and automated access control policies for IoT devices together with a successful proof of concept that demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of throughput and resource access delay between the blockchain component and the controller as well as from node to node. The number of nodes in the IoT network and the number of resource access requests were independently and systematically increased during the evaluations. The results illustrate that the resource access delay and throughput were affected neither linearly nor exponentially; hence, the proposed solution shows no significant degradation in performance with an increase in the number of nodes and/or requests.},

	abstract = {Designing a secure and efficient authentication protocol is crucial and challenging in the mobility network. Due to the seamless roaming of mobile users over multiple foreign agents and the broadcast nature of the communication channel, the mobile networks are often exposed to several network attacks. To achieve perfect authentication and secure communication among mobility entities like MU (Mobile User), FA (Foreign Agent) and HA (Home Agent), the researchers have proposed numerous authentication protocols in the past. However, the existing protocols for the mobility environments are insufficient to address the fundamental security concerns and an adversary can impersonate the mobile user at anytime. Thus, we propose Mobile-Chain, a secure blockchain-based authentication system for mobility environments. The proposed Mobile-Chain is designed to protect user privacy and guarantees provable security like authentication, anonymity, untraceability, confidentiality, data integrity, and decentralization. The implementation of the security framework has been done on the ethereum blockchain platform using smart contracts written in a solidity programming language. The security analysis reveals that Mobile-Chain is robust against various security threats to which mobility networks are vulnerable. Besides, the authentication framework has been measured through a formal security verification tool known as Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Application (AVISPA). Notably, the performance evaluation of the proposed protocol proves that it maintains performance gain, computationally efficient, and implementable in resource-limited wireless and mobility environments.},

That is, blockchain provides a trustworthy and decentralized data infrastructure for AI, and AI helps blockchain perform tasks requiring intelligence. Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business processes can be seen as smart contracts, as they are oftentimes adopted to express agreements among different organizations. Indeed, they provide mechanisms to formalize the obligations of each involved party. For instance, collaborative business processes can specify when a certain task should be executed, under which conditions a service should be offered to the other participants, and how physical objects and information should be manipulated. In this setting, to prevent misuse of smart contracts and services and information provided, it is paramount to guarantee by design that security requirements are fulfilled. With the rise in popularity of blockchains, several approaches exploiting the trusted smart contract execution environment offered by this technology to enforce collaborative business processes have been proposed. Yet, the complexity of business processes, security requirements, and blockchain applications calls for an engineering approach that guides the design of secure business processes. Such an approach should both take advantage of the possibilities offered by blockchain technology to enforce some security requirements (e.g., non-repudiation), and take into account the limitations blockchain poses for other security requirements (e.g., confidentiality). However, we are not aware of any existing work that aims at addressing such issues following a similar approach. In this article, we propose SecBPMN2BC: a model-driven approach to designing business processes with security requirements that are meant to be deployed on blockchains. SecBPMN2BC consists of: (i) an extension of BPMN 2.0 that allows designing secure smart contracts; (ii) a set of algorithms and their implementation that check incompatible security requirements and help the design of smart contracts; (iii) a workflow that guides the application of the method. The method has been validated with a survey conducted on security and BPMN experts.},

	abstract = {The development of 5G technology provides huge potential for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the IoV scenario, the secure exchange of traffic warning data is necessary to guarantee the safety of pedestrians, vehicles, and public transport facilities. However, there remain a series of challenging issues to achieve data secure sharing while ensuring efficiency. Current solutions such as the data outsourcing storage of traditional centralized cloud servers may cause information leakage due to their incomplete credibility. To address these problems mentioned above, this paper proposes an edge-aided searchable data sharing scheme based on blockchain for IoV in a 5G environment. First, the proposed scheme stores the search index of the keyword and the hash value of the data ciphertext on the blockchain to ensure its integrity and authenticity, and the smart contract automatically verifies the search trapdoor. And then, an edge caching mechanism is designed to quickly feedback on users’ retrieval needs based on a cloud-edge collaboration model. In addition, attribute-based searchable encryption is used to ensure that only the users who meet the access attributes and policy can decrypt the encrypted traffic warning data, which can achieve fine-grained access control and keyword search simultaneously. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our scheme is secure and more efficient compared with other schemes.},

	abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing, outsourcing a computation has become a common practice. A client, to have greater confidence in computations performed by the cloud, should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. Two approaches are followed to verify the correctness of the results: (1) Proof-based verifiable computing and (2) Replication-based Verifiable Computing. The first approach uses cryptography techniques, whereas the second approach follows game-theoretic methods. Although both approaches are almost perfect solutions to verify the results, they do not discuss fairness in verifiable computing. In this paper, we consider the problem of fairness in verifiable cloud computing, which means that the cloud gets the payment from a client for an outsourced computation if and only if the client receives the correct output of the computation. Most of the existing solutions rely on a trusted third-party to realise fairness. Motivated by the recent advances in blockchain technology and smart contracts, we propose protocols for different verifiable computing techniques using smart contracts. We first present a smart-contract based solution for fair proof-based verifiable computation and show that the overhead of using smart-contract is almost negligible when both client and cloud are honest. Then we show two different solutions depending upon the number of clouds hired to achieve fairness in replication-based verifiable computing. We have designed our protocols in the Blockchain model of cryptography and proved their security under universally composable theory. We also show the financial and transactional cost analysis of proposed contracts by implementing them in solidity and running them on Ethereum Blockchain.},

In this paper, we first propose a privilege-based data access structure and incorporates it into an attribute-based encryption mechanism to handle the management and sharing of big data sets. Our proposed privilege-based data access structure makes managing healthcare records using mobile healthcare devices efficient and feasible for large numbers of users. We then propose a novel distributed multilevel EMR (d-EMR) management scheme, which uses blockchain to address security concerns and enables selective sharing of medical records among staff members that belong to different levels of a hierarchical institution. We deploy smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain and utilize a distributed storage system to alleviate the dependence on the record-generating institutions to manage and share patient records. To preserve privacy of patient records, our smart contract is designed to allow patients to verify attributes prior to granting access rights. We provide extensive security, privacy, and evaluation analyses to show that our proposed scheme is both efficient and practical.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that enables transactional consensus among untrusted nodes. Due to the independence between blockchains, it is tough to complete asset exchange tasks between diverse chains. Facing this problem, multiple cross-chain exchange schemes were proposed, but they have not been widely used due to various defects in terms of compatibility, flexibility, security, and practicability. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive cross-chain exchange system called Practical AgentChain. Various coins can be mapped to the corresponding tokens on Practical AgentChain for trading. One or multiple trading operators can spontaneously form a service deposit pool on existing blockchains and register a trading group for profit using the well-designed smart contract called Agent Contract. All the trading groups competitively provide cross-chain exchange services. Clients with exchange currency requirements can freely select an appropriate trading group to request services, such as mapping assets to tokens or withdraw tokens. The choice of the trading group is made according to the group’s deposit and the group members’ reputation recorded on the Agent Contract. This system also incorporates Town crier as the reliable Data Oracle system for obtaining the status of cross-chain transactions and combines a matching exchange protocol to ensure the fairness of on-chain token exchange. In addition, we design an impartial service arbitration mechanism and a deposit allocation scheme to ensure the reliability of the system. Through security analysis, our system can resist re-use attacks, denial-of-service attacks and resolve service availability issues. We modify the Town crier adaptively and combine it with Ethereum to implement the simulation. The experimental results show that Practical AgentChain is efficient and low-cost. Besides, our system can be deployed on any existing blockchain that supports smart contracts since the system’s architecture is highly portable.},

	abstract = {Electronic auction (e-auction) has become one of the most popular approaches to allocate resources or services in contemporary society because of removing physical limitations of traditional auctions. The rapid expansion of e-auction enhances work efficiency but incurs some new and distinctive challenges such as low-robustness, data privacy, and lack of trust. To address the above concerns, various auction designs have been proposed by researchers from the academic and industrial circles. However, most of them fail in simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e. auctioneer-free), privacy-preserving (i.e. bids privacy), collusion-resistance, and secure-channel free. In this paper, we present an effective smart contract-based verifiable privacy-preserving sealed-bid reverse auction scheme, which not only has no need for trusted third parties, but also achieves robustness and privacy protection of losing bids even in the face of overwhelming collusion. In this scheme, the central auctioneer is replaced with some carefully designed smart contracts for decentralization, while zero-knowledge proof and anonymous veto networks are used to avoid the secret communication channel, support the public verifiability and detect the malicious behaviors of bidders. More practically, the complexity of the designed scheme is independent of the number of bidders. Finally, we implement a prototype of our design based on a locally simulated Ethereum test network. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the scheme is the high efficiency and practicality.},

The rapid PCB prototyping service providers are pursuing the mass individualization paradigm. Yet, these providers suffer from low efficiency and high cost in the large-scale small-batched mixed pilot production of rapid PCB prototyping. To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework. A blockchained smart contracts-driven multi-agent system is established at the edge to realize efficient tasks coordination under disturbances. Based on the operation events data and control decisions collected at the edge, a customized deep learning-driven prediction model is established at the cloud for supporting the rescheduling decisions. The blockchained smart contracts (e.g., Stackelberg game solution) at the edge proactively decentralize short-term fine-grained individualized task execution among manufacturing units/machines and make the results available on upper-level deep learning model at the cloud for supporting holistic rescheduling decisions. The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization. Through a simulated case based on data collected from a rapid PCB prototyping service provider in China, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed CEO-BAPC framework are verified.},

	abstract = {The development of cloud computing and the Internet of things (IOT) attracts more and more enterprises to outsource the data from their Industrial Internet of things (IIOT) to cloud servers in order to save operating costs and improve efficiency. However, in this environment, protecting the security and privacy of data storage is an important challenge for IIOT and cloud server provider (CSP). Data auditing could allow data owner discover malicious behaviors of CSP which destroy their outsourced data. The public auditing authorizes the trusted third part auditor (TPA) to audit the owner’s outsourced data and frees owner from regular tasks. However, the public auditing using TPA is considered a centralized auditing, and the TPA is assumed totally honest, but it is difficult to find a reliable auditing organization. In this paper, a novel decentralized auditing smart contract in Ethereum is proposed. By replacing the TPA with a designed smart contract, a decentralized auditing scheme (Dredas) is proposed, where anyone can obtain the auditing result from Ethereum without worrying about semi-honest TPA. Compared with traditional auditing, apart from being able to perform traditional auditing functions, Dredas has three important benefits over previous work. First, the random values of challenge are more secure. Dredas chooses the current blockchain nonce as a random seed to prevent any party forging random values. Secondly, in order to achieve a safe, regular, proactive auditing, the protocol writes the auditing rules into the blockchain, and uses the number blocks on the Ethereum as the security timestamp. Finally, data owner, user and CSP must pay some ether for smart contract as deposit. This way not only inhibits the malicious behavior of these three parties, but also makes it more reasonable in real life. We implement Dredas to show that the computation costs are reasonable and efficient.},

We proposed a blockchain-based framework along with the use of an affiliated technology, i.e., smart contracts, to derive the feasible benefits of the supply chain process design. Through the illustrative design of an integrated process, we provide an achievable use case of the disintermediation of business processes via a conceptual, shared information ledger. This ledger not only facilitates the sharing of tracking information but also promotes a network for multilateral collaboration among supply chain members. The pursuit of transparency and accountability across supply chain processes can potentially influence decentralization and automation. A comparative analysis of the current and proposed frameworks is conducted to support the core reasoning of this study. Additionally, future implications on managerial practice and academic research are explored to provide pervasive suggestions for similar attempts in different sectors.

	abstract = {A smart contract is an electronic transaction protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and execution of the terms of an underlying legal contract designed to fulfil common contractual conditions comprising payments, legal obligations, and enforcement without third parties. Thus, by following the traditional perception, smart contracts target to reduce transaction costs including arbitration and enforcement costs by realising trackable and irreversible transactions by using blockchain technology for distributed databases. However, the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating the entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organisational business-processes that are characteristic for smart supply chains. A closer look to existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to supply chain management, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 solutions. The author participated in several EU projects related to transnational entrepreneurial networks and smart supply chains. Thus, the paper discusses the research question of how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable entrepreneurial activities in smart supply chains. The research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies, which took place in the context of the EU projects with a focus on the Baltic Sea Region.},

Although blockchain is considered a potential solution for these concerns, the pension industry has not fully leveraged this disruptive technology. This paper provides a blueprint for a blockchain-based end-to-end digital transformation of the pension industry. First, we identified the pre-requisites for blockchain adoption in pension. Then, we developed an architectural design of blockchain-based re-designed pension business processes. Subsequently, we elaborated on how smart contracts can make pension transactions in such redesigned processes optimized, automated, and error-free. Finally, we presented how blockchain can be integrated with the existing pension IT systems, using an API layer, to enable seamless onboarding of all pension participants to a single digital platform – a critical ask for any blockchain implementation. We concluded with an elucidation of the potential of such blockchain-based digital transformation of the pension industry in reducing turnaround time, lowering operating expenses, and facilitating the achievement of other pension reform agendas. This architecture of a blockchain-enabled pension network represents a flexible and scalable knowledge construct that can act as a foundation for further investigations by pension regulators or pension industry participants interested in achieving technology-driven pension operations reforms.},

Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model’s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.},

	abstract = {Efficient tracking of shipments is critical in managing global trade and logistics activities. The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain. The Smart contracts were implemented in Solidity language and tested using Remix IDE environment, the code has been made publicly available for academic, research and practice community.},

However, companies worry that the business information is leaked in the process of horizontal cooperation. This kind of mistrust often leads to the failure of horizontal cooperation. The emergence of blockchain technology has become a great means to resolve trust problem between partners, which ensures data sharing and trust through peer-to-peer, consensus mechanism and encryption technology. In response, this study proposes architecture of blockchain-based urban distribution system for horizontal cooperation that analyzes the components and layers of the urban distribution. Meanwhile, a smart contract, the innovative applications of blockchain, is designed to match the resource of supply and demand to design the distribution routes in the urban distribution system. To achieve the above goal, an open vehicle routing model of urban distribution taking into account environmental pollution factors is developed as the mathematical logic of smart contract, which aims at the lowest total cost including fixed, fuel, penalty, carbon emission and pollutant emission costs. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm is developed to support the implementation of smart contract, and the effectiveness of the smart contract is verified through a real case. This study narrows the knowledge gap in applying blockchain technology to urban distribution, and has brought contributions to the fields of blockchain and urban distribution. Finally, the limitation and future research direction are discussed.},

A decentralised low carbon incentive mechanism is formulated targeting on specific prosumption behaviours.

Conventionally, centralized/distributed database-based traceability platforms are adopted by many drug companies to control drug quality and improve transparency levels. However, it is still challenging to link drug stakeholders into an information-sharing chain due to the potential data manipulations and interest conflicts. In this context, this paper proposes a unified five-layer Blockchain and Internet of Things-based smart tracking and tracing (BIoT3, in short) platform to provide a decentralized traceability solution in the drug supply chain. Following the five-layer blockchain platform architecture, a practical roadmap is provided for the drug industry to achieve blockchain design, development, application, and evaluation. Moreover, three core enabling components are presented: IoT-based drug identity management, on-chain \& off-chain mechanism, smart contract-enabled drug services. According to the real data from collaborating companies, the feasibility and efficiency of the BIoT3 platform have been verified using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The case study demonstrates that it not only gains useful insights into transaction sizes configuration for optimal blockchain performance, but also provides a feasible blockchain-based solution for drug traceability and visibility.},

In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.},

This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process.

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, which allows energy consumers/producers to directly trade with each other, is one of the new paradigms driven by the decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization of the energy supply chain. Additionally, the rise of blockchain technology suggests unprecedented socio-economic benefits for energy systems, especially when coupled with P2P energy trading. Despite such future prospects in energy systems, three key challenges might hinder the full integration of P2P energy trading and blockchain. First, it is quite complicated to design a decentralized P2P market that keeps a fair balance between economic efficiency and information privacy. Secondly, with the proliferation of storage devices, new P2P market designs are needed to account for their inter-temporal dependencies. Thirdly, a practical implementation of blockchain technology for P2P trading is required, which can facilitate efficient trading in a secured and fraud-resilient way, while eliminating any intermediaries’ costs. In this paper, we develop a new decentralized P2P energy trading platform to address all the aforementioned challenges. Our platform consists of two key layers: market and blockchain. The market layer features a parallel and short-term pool-structured auction and is cleared using a novel decentralized Ant-Colony Optimization method. This market arrangement guarantees a near-optimally efficient market solution, preserves players’ privacy, and allows inter-temporal market products trading. The blockchain layer offers a high level of automation, security, and fast real-time settlements through smart contract implementation. Finally, using real-world data, we simulate the functionality of the platform regarding energy trading, market clearing, smart contract operations, and blockchain-based settlements.},

	abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health \& safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V\&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V\&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).},

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to all kinds of equipment in industrial production, whether it is machine equipment in factories or engine in automobiles and airplanes, on which sensors are installed and connected to wireless network terminals to collect and share data. At present, because IIoT system is an open, distributed and heterogeneous system, it is a great challenge to implement trusted communication in IIoT. Blockchain technology has become a new way to solve the cooperative trust issues of industrial Internet of Things. Using blockchain, a tamper-proof system can be built, which can be used as an audit tool for hardware products of industrial Internet of Things from chip to whole equipment. Blockchain improve productivity and operational efficiency of IIoT through smart contract, allowing machines to manage themselves. To apply blockchain technology in IIoT, one of the main issues is to solve the security and efficiency problems of consensus protocols. In this paper, a reputation scheme is proposed to encourage normal nodes and abnormal nodes both to participate in network collaboration in a good way. In order to guide the behavior, a credit based incentive approach is proposed. The reward and punishment factor is designed in the revenue payment function of reputation. The effectiveness is that the cooperative behavior is rewarded, and the non cooperative behavior is punished. The main advantage of our scheme is that our reputation based incentive module can be implemented on state-of-the-art PoX protocols, which is called PoRX,and can make PoX protocols achieve better consensus states. Therefore, it would benefit the applications of IIoT with blockchain. A prototype has been implemented and the experimental results shows that our scheme can effectively encourage the cooperative behavior of the nodes in IIoT, that can benefit the network.},

Recent advancements in mechanism design of data marketplaces have introduced a number of private data query mechanisms that facilitate the trading of private data. A critical assumption to ensuring that these mechanisms function as intended in a real-world online platform, which is often overlooked in the mechanism design literature, is that they are implemented in a network infrastructure that guarantees secure and fair trade. Such a network infrastructure should allow data storage, communications and transactions to satisfy confidentiality, data integrity, fair brokerage, and privacy requirements. In this paper, we propose SmartAuction, the first blockchain-based secure implementation of a private data query system. SmartAuction utilises a public-key encryption scheme, a digital signature scheme and two smart contracts to facilitate the four tasks of a data trade: data submission, data request, auction and query, and payment and delivery. Using universal composability (UC) framework, we verify that SmartAuction satisfies the desirable properties mentioned above. We also conduct experiment to show that SmartAuction can be implemented in real Ethereum platforms and it has a broad applicability.},

	abstract = {Data are an extremely important asset. Governments around the world encourage big data sharing and trading to promote the big data economy. However, existing data trading platforms are not fully trusted. Such platforms face the problems of a single point of failure (SPOF), opaque transactions, uncontrollability, untraceability, and issues of data privacy. Several blockchain-based big data trading methods have been proposed; however, they do not adequately address the security issues introduced by dishonesty in the data provider and data agent or the fairness of data revenue distribution and price bargaining. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized data trading system in which data trading is completed by smart contract-based data matching, price negotiation, and reward assigning. Moreover, the proposed data trading system evaluates the data quality on the basis of three metrics, records the evaluation results in a side-chain, and distributes the data users’ application revenue to the data provider according to the evaluated data quality. We verify the security, usability, and efficiency of the proposed big data trading system.},

	abstract = {In the supply chain ecosystem, trust among transacting parties is a critical component to ensure profitability. However, participating parties act selfishly in their interest resulting in a sub-optimal output for transactions. This makes it difficult for trust to be established and an effective equilibrium to be reached among parties. Therefore, it is essential to ensure coordination among all parties and for all parties to collaborate effectively to avoid this problem. This helps to create a favourable environment and ensures profitability on the supply chain. Previous works have attempted to achieve this by making use of contracting mechanisms to regulate IoT devices and nodes on the network. In these systems, parties are enticed to act in a way so that profit achieved in the supply chain is maximized. However, these contracting mechanisms utilized are centralized and can easily be compromised. Also, these contracts are not enforced by a framework that ensures the effective establishment of trust among parties on the supply chain. Also, equilibrium remains in-established due to the complexity and lack of an effective system to regulate behaviour effectively. In this work, we design a blockchain-adaptive framework that incentivizes participants to work together on the supply chain to establish an equilibrium. We show through a proof of Concept, that the blockchain possesses the necessary attributes needed in establishing a Nash Equilibrium and can be used to coordinate the supply chain in complex scenarios to ensure security, trust, and profit. Using game theory models, we develop novel approaches and prove mathematically that the blockchain is more efficient in establishing a supply chain equilibrium among parties, ensuring fairness among various parties. Additionally, we utilize smart contracts to calculate each participating party’s expected payoff and profit. We also attempt to reduce the level of uncertainties across the supply chain by presenting profit-maximizing parties. Here the transparency provided by the blockchain provides a means to collate information relevant for making effective decisions on the blockchain which proves relevant in multi-complex supply chain networks such as aircraft, and vehicle manufacturing and assembling networks. Here, parties are thus incentivized to make the right decisions. We observe through our test that the blockchain provides all parties with the best payoff that satisfies all parties by incorporating each individual’s decisions on the supply chain, ensuring trust and equilibrium are established. The implementation of our work was achieved using standard blockchain networks. Our results show the cost-efficiency and feasibility of our proposed idea.},

	abstract = {Industrial applications often require federated cloud services from multiple providers to improve reliability and flexibility. Traditional selection methods through auctions usually involve a centralized auctioneer to coordinate the auction procedure. Blockchain and smart contracts provide a decentralized mechanism to automate the cloud auction process; however, existing solutions fail in the selection of the most suitable providers and the violation detection of the signed auction agreements, which are also known as service-level agreements (SLAs). To tackle these problems, we propose an integrated auction model using Bayesian game theory and blockchain techniques. The proposed model is enhanced with two Bayesian Nash Equilibriums (BNEs); the first BNE enables the selection of cost-effective providers to construct the federated cloud services, while the second BNE ensures consistent and trustworthy monitoring of federated SLAs. Moreover, a timed message submission (TMS) algorithm is proposed to protect the auction privacy during the message submission phase. This paper validates the equilibrium results of two BNEs and implements the proposed model on the Ethereum blockchain. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness of our model.},

Their management is decentralized without top executive teams and built on automated rules encoded in smart contracts, and their governance works autonomously based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms that support community decision-making. A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building.

	abstract = {With the advent of mobile crowdsensing, the mobile devices equipped with a variety of sensors (such as accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone etc.) are used to collect sensory data. A data aggregator processes the collected sensor data to deliver various services such as traffic management, health care and environmental monitoring. To ensure the privacy of the data, privacy-preserving aggregation (PPA) has attracted much attention since it can find aggregated statistics on the encrypted data. In this paper, we extend the existing PPA schemes in two directions: (1) Aggregator unforgeability – The aggregator performs the aggregation operation correctly. Although there are some schemes which consider aggregator unforgeability, they rely on cryptographic techniques. (2) Fair payments – The data owners receive the payments for their data contribution if and only if the aggregator receives the data. Contrary to existing works, we achieve the aggregator unforgeability and fair payments by modeling the aggregator as a smart contract running on a public Blockchain network. We design two PPA schemes FairNaivePPA and FairPPA for secure aggregation of MCS data with fair payments. We show the financial and transactional cost analysis of proposed contracts by implementing them in solidity and running them on Ethereum Blockchain.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has revolutionized the ways of processing and storing data in terms of reliability and security. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in transferring the processing hurdle from the client–server to a decentralized and secured platform. Blockchain is deemed to be an efficient technology in a forthcoming era that would beneficiate multifarious industries. An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5\%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5\%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.},

A concurrent mixed-method design was adopted to (a) identify the industry's perspective on what advanced technologies can be accepted to address SOP issues through a questionnaire survey, and (b) identify the use of advanced technologies through a live construction project as a case study. Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done.

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge computing mode has emerged in recent years to overcome the shortcomings of traditional cloud computing mode, such as high delay, network congestion, and large resource consumption. Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic cloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT devices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is how to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double auction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource allocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management agencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we introduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with transaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize resources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based system are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in this paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial double auction mechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the revenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a resource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It can not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also ensure privacy security. Through necessary theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms can be validated.},

Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn.

	abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) aims to seamlessly manage all products and information and knowledge generated throughout the product lifecycle for achieving business competitiveness. Conventionally, PLM is implemented based on standalone and centralized systems provided by software vendors. The information of PLM is hardly to be integrated and shared among the cooperating parties. It is difficult to meet the requirements of the openness, interoperability and decentralization of the Industry 4.0 era. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle.},

The literature shows that to relax the pressure on the last mile sector, blockchain technology can be an effective solution both to protect the firm financial aspects and sustainability requirements. To ensure efficiency in the system and success in the implementation of blockchain technology into the last mile delivery sector, it is essential to study the various factors and capabilities of blockchain to handle the existing problems and requirements to analyze the efficiency of this integration. The focus areas of this paper are mainly to identify the impact of applying blockchain technology to support the last mile delivery of goods. The impacted areas focus mainly on the efficiency of the process and its leverage on the costs, both administrative and operational, and level of sustainability achieved. The proposed platform has enabled the enhancement of the integration of blockchain into the last mile delivery. The proposed smart contract system is designed to efficiently assign the orders from the demander to the respective fleet providers with the help of miners. This assignment is made possible by considering the various aspects that have been stored into the system, namely geographical location, the proximity to the destination of delivery along the route of delivery, size of the parcels, and capacity of the fleet.},

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted for design collaboration in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, while its centralized paradigm suffers the risk of data manipulation. To this end, blockchain is an emerging distributive technology that guarantees data authenticity and integrity by providing decentralized, immutable, and traceable data storage. However, directly integrating BIM with blockchain risks leaking sensitive data, since a blockchain is a transparent network insofar as shared information (including sensitive data) can be disclosed to all members without access control. Therefore, this paper proposes a confidentiality-minded framework (CMF) for blockchain-based design collaboration. The major innovations are twofold. First, an access control model is developed in the CMF to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive BIM data in a blockchain ledger. Second, new design strategies are developed in CMF to facilitate design coordination within the access-controlled blockchain network. An illustrative design example validates the feasibility and performance of the proposed CMF, which has acceptable latency and storage cost. The results also show that the sensitive BIM data are effectively kept confidential when project members collaborate within the CMF.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the development and adoption of blockchain technology in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) because of its authenticity and traceability. However, increasing ITS devices impose grand challenges in privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing. Recent research has demonstrated that integrating searchable symmetric encryption in blockchain enables privacy-preserving data sharing among ITS devices. However, existing solutions focus only on single-keyword searches over encrypted ITS data on the blockchain and suffer from privacy and efficiency issues when extended to multi-keyword scenarios. This work proposes a bloom filter-based multi-keyword search protocol for ITS data with enhanced efficiency and privacy preservation. We design a bloom filter to select a low-frequency keyword from the multiple keywords input by the ITS data owner. The low-frequency keyword can filter out a large portion of the ITS data from the search result, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, each identifier-keyword pair is attached with a pseudorandom tag that enables the completion of a search operation in only one round. In this manner, privacy is preserved because there are no intermediate rounds and results. In addition to the multi-keyword search protocol, we specify the addition and deletion protocols to enable dynamic updates of data records. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of the protocols. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-keyword search protocol saves 14.67\% query time and 59.96\% financial cost.},

	abstract = {E-Agriculture, or Smart Farming, refers to the design, development, and application of innovative methods to use modern information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning, to move towards more sustainable agricultural and farming practices. The integration of blockchain technology in farming is gaining attention for its potential to migrate from the centralized and monopolistic model that shapes today’s food value chain. This paper highlights the fact that most of today’s blockchain-based farming frameworks focus on food tracking and traceability. Only rarely does research focus on the design of digital marketplaces to support the trading of agricultural goods between farmers and potentially interested third party stakeholders; equally rarely are performance evaluations performed for the proposed frameworks. The latter is where this paper contributes the most by, not only proposing a novel blockchain-based farming marketplace platform (called “FarMarketplace”), but also a comprehensive methodology to help software solution integrators to better understand and measure how a given configuration setting of such a platform can influence the overall quality of service performance in the long run.},

	abstract = {Globalisation, shorter product life cycles, and increasing product varieties have led to complex supply chains. At the same time, there is a growing interest of customers and governments in having a greater transparency of brands, manufacturers, and producers throughout the supply chain. Due to the complex structure of collaborative manufacturing networks, the increase of supply chain transparency is a challenge for manufacturing companies. The blockchain technology offers an innovative solution to increase the transparency, security, authenticity, and auditability of products. However, there are still uncertainties when applying the blockchain technology to manufacturing scenarios and thus enable all stakeholders to trace back each component of an assembled product. This paper proposes a framework design to increase the transparency and auditability of products in collaborative manufacturing networks by adopting the blockchain technology. In this context, each component of a product is marked with a unique identification number generated by blockchain-based smart contracts. In this way, a transparent auditability of assembled products and their components can be achieved for all stakeholders, including the customer.},

	abstract = {Digitalization will play a vital role in the achievement of successful transitions towards more flexible, reliable and sustainable energy systems. The progressive availability of data from meters and sensors deployed across end-users and energy supply-chains constitute a first step towards this direction. Leveraging on such cross-sectorial trend, business developers find in decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) – such as the blockchain – opportunities for value creation across a broad range of participants in energy systems. Peer-to-peer energy trading platforms interconnect legacy and novel participants leveraging renewable and storage capacity (small and utility-scale) with grid operators and within local microgrids or markets. In this way, near real time (bi-directional) exchanges can be secured and validated via tokenization and smart contracting. The proposed configurations enable governance arrangements between legacy and novel participants at the platform and sectorial level. This paper focuses on investigating the decentralized governance characteristics proposed by peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and briefly discusses their implications on legacy systems from a broad ‘relational’ (i.e. actor network, sociotechnical transitions) and ‘normative’ (i.e. energy justice) set of theories. The paper draws upon prior surveys and publicly available whitepapers from business initiatives (start-ups). For the purposes of this study, whitepapers constitute official written texts and potential sources of information for the study of emergent ways of governance and collective action leveraging this technology. Results from ground theory method (qualitative) leveraging an inductive content analysis approach, built four (4) main categories that explain: (1) the digital features of these platforms, (2) the participants and incentives involved (3) the purposes and benefits of the solutions and, (4) the governance dynamics arising from trading tokenized energy via smart contracting. Results reveal complex multi-level socio-technical interrelations at different layers and points towards opportunities for private and community-based solutions, end-user empowerment, democratic energy systems and polycentric governance while considering fractal planning in policy design.},

	abstract = {Regulatory changes in different countries regarding self-consumption and growing public concern about the environment are encouraging the establishment of community microgrids. These community microgrids integrate a large number of small-scale distributed energy resources and offers a solution to enhance power system reliability and resilience. This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles, mimicking the most typical layout of cities. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid, without requiring interaction with the distributed system operator. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal.},

	abstract = {With the prevalence of blockchain technology, Ethereum, as the second-largest blockchain, with the capabilities of running smart contracts, grows fast. A user on the Ethereum platform can implement smart contracts as well as remit its cryptocurrency. Cyber-attacks often target cryptocurrency. Besides, Ethereum may be exploited by malicious users for launching attacks. Therefore, the demand for Ethereum network supervision is increasing. To protect interior users on Ethereum from attacks, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should supervise the Ethereum traffic from or to its internal users. Ethereum traffic identification is the first step towards supervision. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer communication network implemented by DEVp2p. DEVp2p is designed to realize data interaction and adopts encryption to enhance anonymity on Ethereum. It is difficult to identify Ethereum traffic accurately at line speed in a high-speed network. So far, Ethereum traffic identification has not been explored yet. This paper designs an efficient Ethereum traffic identification system with high identification accuracy, dubbed ETI (Ethereum Traffic Identification), for an ISP to supervise its internal users on Ethereum without Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). ETI first constructs an active node library consisting of core nodes on Ethereum and active Ethereum peers in the ISP. Then potential Ethereum flows are filtered by checking if their sources or destinations are in the active node library. As active Ethereum nodes may generate non-Ethereum traffic, machine learning classifiers are further adopted to judge if the potential Ethereum traffic is actually from Ethereum. The classification is based on the unique packet/payload-length and port number-related traffic features on Ethereum implemented by DEVp2p. Our experimental studies validate that ETI outperforms state-of-the-art network traffic classification methods in identification accuracy and time efficiency. ETI achieves an identification accuracy of 0.9998 and relatively high time efficiency.},

This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines.},

	abstract = {The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the cloud posed technical challenges for the design of compliance solutions. In particular, the accountability principle in the GDPR requires cloud providers to demonstrate their compliance, which implies that a GDPR compliance solution should maintain tamper-proof evidence for the massive data processing activities in cloud services. Additionally, the transparency of a compliance solution is essential for improving the trust of cloud users. Most of the existing solutions implemented their compliance logic as smart contracts on a blockchain to utilize its immutable transaction history for accountability and to gain user trust through its transparency. However, this widely adopted pattern in the solutions imposed the throughput constraint of blockchains on the implementation of compliance logic. In order to address this, we first conduct a requirement analysis of the GDPR accountability principle. After the analysis, we introduce a domain model of the principle and propose a modularized architecture to support the accountability in the cloud. Then, we present a prototype implementation of the architecture, in which a blockchain-based technique is used to provide immutability and data integrity for event records (e.g., data processing activities of cloud providers), while the compliance logic is not affected by the overhead of blockchains. Finally, we evaluate the prototype using benchmarks and analyses to investigate the throughput, resource consumption, and scalability of the architecture.},

It also lacks proper authentication among the participants, data management as well as the integrity of the data. The blockchain mechanism is capable of solving the above-mentioned issues due to its important features such as decentralization, transparency, trust-less environment, anonymity, and immutability. This paper describes how the blockchain mechanism combines with the traditional pharmaceutical supply chain system and to achieve a better SCM system, we present a blockchain-based scheme for information sharing securely in the pharmaceutical supply chain system with smart contracts and consensus mechanism. The proposed scheme also provides a mechanism to distribute required cryptographic keys to all the participants securely using the smart contract technique. Further, transaction and block validation protocols have been designed in our protocol.

To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a decentralized auditing scheme BVA for the single cloud storage server, and an extended batch auditing scheme E-BVA for distributed storage. Firstly, BVA and E-BVA utilize vector commitment technology to realize lightweight data integrity auditing for outsourced data. Secondly, to avoid privacy and performance risks caused by the third party auditor, both BVA and E-BVA employ a smart contract on the blockchain as an auditor to perform data integrity auditing. Thirdly, both schemes support the verifiability between outsourced data and their corresponding authenticators, which prevents malicious data owners framing cloud storage servers and avoid subsequent dispute arbitration. Finally, based on regenerating code, E-BVA supports data self-repair of corrupted servers, while protecting the privacy of outsourced data and realizing the lightweight computation.

	abstract = {Although blockchains are systems that are intended to survive on their own, they still may need human intervention like other Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) architectures. The reasons for this intervention are twofold: management of blockchain nodes and governance of blockchain. The second focuses on sustaining blockchain unlike the first one concerning with operation of individual nodes. Proposed blockchain governance models so far include cumbersome processes in which deciding and deployment of changes rely on the involvement of multiple actors. They have been criticized from various aspects such as reducing the decentralized nature of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a novel on-chain governance model exploiting both policy-based management and decentralized identity technologies. Since it allows controlling the behavior of the system via higher level expressions that are easy to understand, the policy based management concept will fit in well with blockchain ecosystems having stakeholders from different knowledge levels. This model is not only more effective regarding existing off-chain governance models but also is simpler and more user friendly than other on-chain governance models. Besides, the emerging decentralized identity concept has the potential for solving many problems related to decision-making process of blockchain governance. By employing this concept, our approach fortifies decentralization, security and fairness while providing well-directed governance. The smart contract based modular design of our framework opens the door for adoption of its components by other governance models as well.},

To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market.

Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers’ income and consumers’ cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling.

	abstract = {Purpose This study investigates the affective technology acceptance model applied to the case of blockchain through Twitter text mining. Design/methodology/approach The analysis focuses on mapping the acceptance drivers of the blockchain technology by visualizing the users perception constructs through Blockchain hashtags. More than 5000 relevant tweets per day were collected between December 15, 2020, and January 15, 2021. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney tests were applied over the frequency of the characteristics and the emotions' measurements to validate the research hypotheses. Findings The results prove that users show more interest in security, shareability, and decentralization characteristics. Therefore, the blockchain technology usefulness is rather perceived in the informational domain, and the blockchain ease of use is further expressed in smart contracts as a use case. Blockchain benefits are more discussed than the drawbacks among Twitter users. Besides, positive feelings with strong emotions of trust and joy dominate among users. In summary, the results show significant awareness of users towards blockchain technology. Originality To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first study that explores the affective technology acceptance model with user-generated content analysis.},

How to ensure the authentication between different system and domain in IoT has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a master-slave chain based trusted cross-domain authentication mechanism in IoT to improve the efficiency and credibility of authentication. In this system, a master-slave blockchain architecture supporting distributed cross-domain authentication is designed. Then, an improved Byzantine Fault Tolerance based on reputation value model (RIBFT)is proposed for trusted authentication and data traceability. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively improve the efficiency and credibility of authentication for IoT devices. In addition, the model is also used in practical applications.},

Since blockchain is an emerging technology which is still at an early stage of development, there is limited experience on applying blockchain to real-world software applications. We applied blockchain application design approaches proposed in software architecture community in a real-world project called originChain, which is a blockchain-based traceability system that restructures the current system by replacing the central database with blockchain. In this paper, we share our experience of building originChain. By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain.

The model distinguishes three basic elements: digital management, transaction business process and smart contract which determine the process optimization and the efficiency of implementing financial innovations in project supply chain.

The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.},

Agents will learn to strategically negotiate terms of exchanges while considering private preferences, necessities, and the public negotiation context of this market. Design details for the market comprising technological enablers such as Internet of Things, Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications are presented.

In this paper, to address the problems above, we propose a Cloud–Blockchain Fusion Framework (CBFF) to achieve data accountability among multiple clouds. CBFF improves the trustworthiness of operation to cloud data by designing secure mechanisms between clouds and blockchain. It designs a unified data Naming and Addressing Mechanism to publish and locate cloud data globally in a multi-cloud environment. Also, it proposes the Operation Tracing Mechanism to achieve reliable operation logging and tracing. With CBFF, we present a prototype implementation system using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and Alibaba Cloud Computing. Our system could provide secure data uploading, sharing, and updating among multiple clouds. Finally, we also provide experiments and analysis to demonstrate that our framework has significant efficiency and security improvements.},

Nevertheless, integrated solutions that cover all the aspects of circular supply chain including network structure, business processes, and the products are still missing. This paper is an attempt to bridge this gap, through offering a workable solution to address the disconnected nature of blockchain adoption across construction procedures. Informed by the overall approach of design science research (DSR), the solution is created following the five-staged procedure of DSR: (1) problem identification, (2) treatment suggestion, (3) treatment design, (4) evaluation and (5) conclusion. Findings establish that the proposed solution is novel in several ways; it: (1) enables construction practitioners to share their building components information on a safe and immutable medium; (2) enables government authorities (i.e., city council) to track the treatment and delivery of hazardous products/materials; (3) supports the upstream circular economy design through fostering collaboration among ‘designers to designers’ and ‘designers to asset owners’ in a blockchain network; and (4) supports developing ‘a bank of reusable BIM families’, encouraging designers to use these items in their designs. Apart from these contributions, this study provides some fertile ground for future research. Chief among all: future studies can provide fully automated systems through integrating the solution presented here with the Internet of Things (IoT); and researchers that validate the workability of the proposed solution across various contexts and real-life projects in exposure to various settings and peculiarities.},

	abstract = {Interim payment provisions in construction projects are susceptible to unfair practices. In construction project participants with varying financial capacities belonging to different organizations are bound by contractual relationships. Due to this type of project organizational structure, project participants do not completely trust each other which prevents the adoption of existing centralized automated frameworks for interim payment. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed blockchain-based framework that does not require to be trusted for automatically enforcing the terms and conditions related to interim payments and sharing payment records at project-level transparently and securely. A logic to automatically initiate, validate, and disburse interim payments according to general contract conditions for interim payments is formalized in this paper. A blockchain-based data model that enables selective-transparency in payment records is proposed. This data model facilitates the sharing of sensitive financial information privately between two contracting parties and non-sensitive payment-related information publicly among all project participants. The proposed blockchain-based framework is supported by a key management strategy to facilitate different security properties such as confidentiality and authenticity of data and users. Considering the non-technical nature of construction project participants, the proposed key management strategy is designed to dynamically generate cryptographic keys from publicly sharable parameters so that storage and management overheads are reduced. Security properties such as immutability, data confidentiality, user integrity, performance, and cost of deployment of the proposed blockchain framework are validated and recommendations for executing the proposed framework with a high level of security are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {With the arrival of the 5G era, wireless communication technologies and services are rapidly exhausting the limited spectrum resources. Spectrum auctions came into being, which can effectively utilize spectrum resources. Because of the complexity of the electronic spectrum auction network environment, the security of spectrum auction can not be guaranteed. Most scholars focus on researching the security of the single-sided auctions, while ignoring the practical scenario of a secure double spectrum auction where participants are composed of multiple sellers and buyers. Researchers begin to design the secure double spectrum auction mechanisms, in which two semi-honest agents are introduced to finish the spectrum auction rules. But these two agents may collude with each other or be bribed by buyers and sellers, which may create security risks, therefore, a secure double spectrum auction is proposed in this paper. Unlike traditional secure double spectrum auctions, the spectrum auction server with Software Guard Extensions (SGX) component is used in this paper, which is an Ethereum blockchain platform that performs spectrum auctions. A secure double spectrum protocol is also designed, using SGX technology and cryptographic tools such as Paillier cryptosystem, stealth address technology and one-time ring signatures to well protect the private information of spectrum auctions. In addition, the smart contracts provided by the Ethereum blockchain platform are executed to assist offline verification, and to verify important spectrum auction information to ensure the fairness and impartiality of spectrum auctions. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation of our protocol are discussed.},

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis.},

However, it relies on a trusted central party for scheduling, which introduces performance bottlenecks and cannot be set up in a distributed network, in addition, the lack of transparency in state-of-the-art Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) power trading schemes can introduce further trust issues. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based trustworthy collaborative power trading scheme for 5G-enabled social vehicular networks that uses a distributed market mechanism to introduce trusted power trading and avoids the dependence on a centralized dispatch center. Based on the game theory, we design the pricing and trading matching mechanism for V2V power trading to obtain maximum social welfare. We use blockchain to record power trading data for trusted pricing and use smart contracts for transaction matching. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving social welfare and reducing the load on the grid.},

	abstract = {Context Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms. Objective Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organizations by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model. Method This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. The decision model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problems in software production. Results We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort. Conclusion We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of captured knowledge regarding Decentralized Autonomous Organization Platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a novel subset of Internet of Things (IoT), integrates sensors and intelligent devices with industry applications to develop a self-organizing system for creating enhanced and adaptive industrial environments. IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.},

In this paper, we identify a specific Department of Defense use case, extrapolate requirements, and perform a thorough assessment of the different layers of the blockchain stack to identify the existing state of the art and undertake a gap analysis of the technology for this context. We describe a platform that meets many of these challenges and show how we architected, designed, and implemented a solution for this use case for deployment at NAVAIR.

	abstract = {Smart networks, e.g., smart grids (SGs) as complex interconnected systems have become more complex and require greater processing and communication capabilities due to the growing use of renewable energy (RE). In addition to being a reliable method for collecting and managing information, wireless networks (WNs) are capable of enhancing the performance of RE management. As a result of wireless data transfer risks and centralized power trades, SGs using WNs are unable to provide the security of the electricity market or ensure a high level of RE utilization. Blockchains (BCs), which are new technologies that enable data sharing, are gaining popularity, and it is thought to be able to address these issues. A BC-based, reliable power-exchange scheme is presented for SGs using WNs in this study. Using the BC for recording power data obtained from the WNs allows the smart contract for making appropriate trades according to the information. Energy trading and RE consumption are more efficient in a dual-chain architecture that consists of local energy trade BCs and RE trade BCs. A BC-based RE incentive framework is designed to have greater stability and scale among RE producers. Overall, the proposed technique not only can provide higher security and reliability to the system but also can mitigate fraud, as well as providing less operation cost for the system. Ultimately, the 56-bus test feeder layout is used to validate the framework.},

	abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99\% using both datasets.},

	abstract = {Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone \& McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system.

Special vehicles (e.g. police cars, ambulances and fire trucks) often encounter traffic jams when carrying out emergency tasks, which may lead to unexpected consequences (e.g. causing serious damage to our routine and property). In order to ensure that special vehicles can quickly pass through crowded road and arrive at the accident scene in time, this paper proposes a blockchain-based special vehicles priority access guarantee scheme (BSV-PAGS). In BSV-PAGS, we introduce blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT), and construct a decentralized distributed edge node network based on blockchian, which guarantees the information sharing among the edge nodes as well as processing the data efficiently. The intelligent terminal device will upload the special vehicle information to the edge node in the blockchain, and then the uploaded information will sync to each edge node through the information sharing smart contract, realizing the information sharing among the edge nodes. In addition, we use machine learning method (e.g. Bag of Visual Words and Support Vector Machine) to design and train special vehicle detectors to improve the recognition accuracy of special vehicles. We design a special vehicle priority access smart contract to achieve real-time scheduling of vehicles and ultimately ensure the priority of special vehicles. Then, we carried out a security analysis of BSV-PAGS. Finally, we test a large number of simulation experiments based on Ethereum clients. The experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and effective.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up a new dimension for smart farming and agriculture because of the natural feature that makes it possible to assign tasks made by a user or that transfers agriculture data obtained through sensors to producers for analysis on various terminal devices. In recent years, heightened interest in agriculture data has arisen since the commercialization of precision agriculture technology. Agriculture data are known to be messy, especially from combine yield monitors, and analysts are concerned with the validity of data, especially given that other people may have impacted data quality at various steps along the data path. The blockchain can be a possible solution to the analyst’s problem of uncertain data quality from prior data manipulation since it ensures data have not been inappropriately manipulated or at the very least documents what changes have been made by specific individuals. This paper proposes a blockchain-based fish farm platform to ensure agriculture data integrity. The designed platform aims to provide fish farmers with secure storage for preserving the large amounts of agriculture data that cannot be tampered with. Diverse processes of the fish farm are executed automatically by using the smart contract to reduce the risk of error or manipulation. A proof of concept that integrates a legacy fish farm system with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is implemented on top of the proposed architecture. The efficiency and usability of the proposed platform are demonstrated through a series of experiments using various metrics.},

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme against existing state-of-the-art approaches with respect to parameters such as network, security, transaction costs, and auction.},

	abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.},

First, BT, NPO, and related theories of risk management are introduced. Second, the network situation of public opinion dissemination in the blockchain environment is discussed. Finally, a BT-based risk management model of the NPO is implemented, and experiments are conducted to verify the effect of the model. Furthermore, the theoretical framework of NPO credibility model detection is optimized according to the public opinion risk prediction model. The research results reveal that the three experimental schemes reached the peak density of the number of public opinion disseminators in the third step, and the highest values were 0.1335, 0.1318, and 0.1296, respectively. Moreover, the density of public opinion dissemination in the three experimental schemes reached a stable state of 0.087, 0.088, and 0.0898, respectively after 48 steps. Under BT, the designed three experimental schemes can reasonably conduct the risk prediction and credibility detection of NPO.

	abstract = {Data outsourcing has become a popular application. Searchable encryption (SE) can provide data retrievability as well as keep data privacy. In the threat model of SE schemes, the cloud server is usually assumed to be Honest-But-Curious, but this may not be true in reality. The blockchain-based SE makes malicious cloud servers dare not to deviate from the protocol, and search results are validated by miners. However, rational miners would skip the validation step and accept the block directly to save computational resources. This situation is called the Verifier’s Dilemma which will make the blockchain-based SE scheme not real verifiable. Therefore, this paper proposes a verifiable blockchain-based public-key encryption scheme that outsources the verification to the TrueBit network. This design makes our scheme achieves effective verifiability which will minimize the computational cost of miners. Furthermore, our scheme also establishes a fair payment protocol between the multiple data owners and data users. Also, the data owner can revoke the permission of the document he/she shared before. We also present security proofs and analysis of the proposed scheme. Performance evaluation presents the overheads of performing search operations on the cloud server and conducting transactions on smart contracts in Ethereum.

Illegal authorization means that some attribute authorities might collude with users and issue attribute keys to unauthorized users illegally. Key disclosure denotes that some users might maliciously expose their attribute keys to the public. Both the above problems could lead to unauthorized users accessing digital content, which is extremely harmful to DRM. To solve these problems, we design a novel MA-ABE scheme based on blockchain. Our scheme ensures that a relevant user could obtain the final decryption attribute key only after all attribute authorities have issued their keys to the blockchain publicly. If a malicious attribute authority issues attribute keys to inappropriate users, the auditor defined in our scheme would detect the malicious behavior. Meanwhile, once some users publish their decryption keys to the public, the auditor is able to transparently trace such users utilizing an incentive mechanism. In addition, we design and implement two smart contracts on Ethereum, called RecordContract and TraceContract, which are used to record users’ encrypted attribute keys and encourage participants to trace the owner of disclosed decryption attribute key, respectively. Finally, the security proof and efficiency simulation show that the proposed scheme can be securely and efficiently applied to DRM.},

This paper presents the design, the prototype implementation and the analysis of a decentralized, real-time, uniform-price double auction energy market. The proposed market is a distributed and decentralized application and its rules may be specified through a smart contract. Market participants interact with the smart contract sending their asks and offers and the distributed application clears the market based on a uniform-price economic dispatch model. We propose and analyze three different implementation approaches on an Ethereum blockchain network. A model representing a physical demonstration project conducted in Seattle, USA, is utilized to simulate the power grid and to provide real-life scenarios for our analysis. We systematically evaluate our three implementation approaches and elucidate several blockchain issues regarding the decentralization of next-generation energy markets. In particular, we identify that certain computation modules may be installed on smart consuming devices in order to increase efficiency, security and decentralization and reduce the overall blockchain overhead cost. Furthermore, we show that in order to fulfill the market’s high demand for step timing, we ought to have the block generation time several magnitudes smaller compared to the auction period.},

However, the application of distributed reputation in the energy field has not been fully studied yet. In this paper, we design a distributed reputation system to simulate real-world trust in blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading. It is a comprehensive reputation system in the sense that reputation scores are decided by the behavior of participants as consensus nodes, energy buyer, and energy sellers. Its implementation relies on blockchain, especially the smart contract technology, to achieve distributed and automatic reputation management. The distributed reputation system in turn helps to implement a delegated consensus algorithm for blockchain and a reputation-based k-double auction matchmaking scheme for peer-to-peer energy trading. In addition, we define a fairness indicator to capture the reputation-based average benefits and costs when considering reputation as the contribution to the peer-to-peer energy trading market. By simulating the comprehensive system, the numerical results demonstrate the effects of distributed reputation in improving the efficiency of blockchain and balancing fairness indicators between sellers and buyers during peer-to-peer energy trading.

Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its IoT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute-based signature (ABS) of one IoT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the IoT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.},

There are some problems in distributed energy trading, such as high transaction frequency, small transaction volume, high operation cost, lack of information supervision and so on. The openness, transparency, tamper-proof and automatic execution of smart contracts of blockchain technology are consistent with the transaction demand of distributed energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent transaction model of distributed energy based on blockchain. First, the peer to peer transaction mode and transaction process are analysed. Second, a multi-agent dynamic Stackelberg game is launched. It takes distributed generation owners, energy storage companies and a grid corporation as leaders to conduct power bidding. Third, with consumers as followers, the time of use tariff bidding strategy was solved. The obtained results reveal that distributed energy resources are essential in the energy supply of carbon neutrality, which also determines the complementary relationship between a grid corporation and distributed generation owners. The two agents work together to exert effectiveness for the new power system. There is a large space for energy storage companies to improve, and consumers show a trend of off-peak power consumption.},

In this work, a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain is leveraged to implement real-world applications for energy trading in a smart community. A near-real-time bilateral trading scheme, directly negotiated on a peer-to-peer basis without any intermediary, is designed for achieving supply–demand balance within power network limits. Thenceforward, the specific process of the HF blockchain establishment and the smart contract creation for system initialization, registration, negotiation, trading, balancing and settlement, are detailed demonstrated. In addition, the benchmark is presented to test the performance metrics of execution time, latency, throughput for feasibility and scalability analyses in real-world application. The results illustrate the proposed HF-assisted energy trading platform corroborates the feasibility for the future scalable P2P trading.},

ChainPM extends Blockchain 2.0 with innovative indexing, query, and analysis function sets for key CPM data. Experimental results from a pilot study of a modular construction project showed that the information synchronization latency was reduced by 99.2\% to 99.8\%, and query and analytical functions worked equally well without network connections. ChainPM contributes to a novel trend of Blockchain 3.0 paradigms for CPM digital twins, emphasizing indexing key CPM data, combinatorial query, digital authorship, and fast response without downgrading the ‘single source of truth.’ For practitioners, ChainPM addresses key barriers of Internet reliance and information delay to CPM digital twins.},

This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.},

In the proposed system, four smart contracts are developed by taking advantage of the blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-free, distributed consensus, combined with the Role-Based Access Control Policy (RBACP), realizing the functions of access control policy formulation, enterprise list query, cargo order uploading, and order query. At the same time, the regulator node is added to the Fabric-PSchain system to enhance the credibility and security of data and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Experimental results show that the Fabric-PSChain system has vital confidentiality and data sharing that can speed up the operation of the port supply chain business and has significant application value for the shipping logistics industry.},

The objective of this study is to provide a value-based understanding of what drives people to use cryptocurrencies for value exchange. Based on the users’ perceived value of the technology, as logic of decision making, we explore the role of perceived financial value and the perceived emotional value in the intention to use the technology. The unified technology adoption theory provides the potential drivers of these value concepts, which are extended accounting for sustainability. Furthermore, to capture users’ evolving experience with blockchain technologies, we propose the concept of the cryptocurrency knowledge path, capturing the scope and depth of users’ knowledge on the applicability of cryptocurrencies, as potential influence on the value concepts in the decision to actively use cryptocurrencies. For the analysis, a structural model is set up and estimated using partial least square analysis (PLS-SEM). We identify a positive effect of both value concepts, financial and emotional value, on the intention to use cryptocurrencies. However, interestingly, we find that the emotional value assessment is fully mediated through the knowledge path. Furthermore, we find that environmental sustainability considerations are fully mediated through either of the two value concepts.

Recent advances incorporating data mining and cloud computing have leveraged the great potential of these data. However, the introduction of such technologies in the process of mobile crowd sensed data mining and analytics could potentially lead to security and privacy concerns. Individuals and organizations are not able to share and collectively run computations on their private data captured by different sensors to infer any processes of common interest. Although solutions such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) were laid decades ago, they are still perceived for theoretical interest only, so far. In this paper, we aim at bridging the gap between privacy-preserving data mining and its practice. To do so, we introduce a blockchain-based privacy-preserving SVM classification (BPPSVC) between mutually distrustful data owners. In BPPSVC, blockchain technology along with smart contracts underlay more realistic assumptions about the adversarial model. Our main focus is on investigating the immutability, security and the bookkeeping properties of the blockchain in preserving the privacy of an SVM classifier over horizontally distributed IoT data. To this end, we first propose the system architecture, adversary model and design goals of BPPSVC, then we describe the design details. Our security analysis indicates that the proposed system is secure and it provides fairness and protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. We finally show the efficiency and feasibility of BPPSVC through rigorous experimental results.},

	abstract = {As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs’ difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.},

These contracts can be manipulated by attackers (insiders or outsiders) for their advantages, creating an unreliable and un-trusted royalty transaction. It may increase disputes between both parties. Hence, a reliable, cost-effective, trusted, secure, and tamper-resistant scheme is required to execute royalty contract transactions in the OaG industry. Motivated from these research gaps, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme, which securely executes the royalty transactions among various stakeholders in OaG industries. We evaluated the performance of the proposed scheme and the smart contracts’ functionalities and compared it with the existing state-of-the-art schemes using various parameters. The results obtained illustrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the existing schemes in the literature.},

To accomplish low-cost and efficient renewable energy trading, a series of automated trading processes is designed for the trading platform, including the token trading mechanism and account management mechanism. Meanwhile, we actualise set of trading processes in the trading platform using smart contract and use the Internet of Things technology to facilitate the automatic execution of trading. Besides, we devised a homomorphic encryption scheme that provides an exceptional level of privacy protection without compromising trading efficiency to better safeguard users' privacy in the trading platform. Therefore, utilising the trading management platform for renewable energy we developed can increase user participation in trading. Finally, the proposed trading management platform has been constructed and deployed utilising the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, and the effect of the homomorphic encryption scheme and the trading process has been tested.

	abstract = {Multi-party systems are important for business processes but can be complex. Blockchain facilitates trust in multi-party systems by providing transparency, decentralised control, and immutable transaction history, to improve security and accountability between parties. The use of cryptographic hashes and the continual validation of the shared ledger in a blockchain system provides parties with data integrity for historical transactions and process integrity for smart contract execution. However, in the design of a broader system combining a blockchain with off-chain components, it is not always clear how system-level integrity is supported. This paper proposes two modelling schemes to better understand blockchain's support for integrity in multi-party blockchain-based systems. The schemes model interactions between components in an architecture as security protocols, for analysis by standard techniques and tools. We first illustrate how blockchain-based systems can be abstractly modelled directly as security protocols. Then we show how blockchain-specific issues such as consensus-based ‘forking’ (also known as ‘orphan blocks’ or ‘uncle blocks’) can be encoded. This allows transaction reordering behaviour to manifest in the model, and allows design mitigation for that problem to be checked. We illustrate our approach with analyses of three design alternatives for possible enhancements to a multi-party system for sharing trade certificates.},

	abstract = {Cognitive radio networks allow opportunistic spectrum access to the unlicensed users, which rely on effective spectrum sensing. Recently, cooperative sensing has been found to improve sensing reliability. However, sometimes the selfish users do not cooperate, and therefore, different incentive design mechanisms like contract theory have been proposed recently, where the cooperation is encouraged by offering appropriate reward to the sensing participants. However, still no secure structure exists for the reward distribution after a successful contract completion, and a user may also deny sensing even after accepting the contract. This work proposes the use of blockchain-based smart contracts, which are based upon a permissioned blockchain that helps in making the transactions private among the participants. Further, the efficiency of this approach is improved by introducing a reputation parameter for the users. This measures the trustworthiness of a particular user based upon the accuracy of their recent sensing results. Further, a money locking approach is proposed from which a penalty is deducted if the user denies or fails to submit a correct reading. Performance analysis of the proposed scheme is done to show the superiority of the scheme.},

In this case, a new VPP trading mode is designed to solve the difficulties in multi-layer coordination and the lack of trust between market entities from the same layer. First, the consortium chain is combined with the multi-agent system to build a VPP internal transaction framework. In order to match the characteristic of the VPP with multi-layer market entities, the main-side chain governance structure is adopted to form data barriers and ensure the scalability of the transaction framework. Second, the existing consensus protocol is improved in accordance with the feature of VPP main chain, and the consensus reputation is introduced to maintain the operation efficiency of the blockchain. In order to improve the execution quality of distributed transactions and the VPP operation stability, the trading reputation closely related to the transaction result is introduced to constrain the trading behavior of aggregators, and a feasible bidding strategy is provided. Finally, the specific trading process of VPP based on the main-side chains is analyzed, and the main functions of smart contracts are designed in combination with internal market rules. The simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed VPP trading mode.},

	abstract = {Criminals can launder crypto-currencies through mixing coins, whose original purpose is preservation of privacy in the presence of traceability. Therefore, it is essential to elaborately design mixing polices to achieve both privacy and anti-money laundering. Existing work on mixing policies relies on the knowledge of a blacklist. However, these policies are paralysed under the scenario where the blacklist is unknown or evolving. In this paper, we regard the above scenario as games under incomplete information where parties put down a deposit for the quality of coins, which is suitably managed by a smart contract in case of mixing bad coins. We extend the poison and haircut policies to incomplete information games, where the blacklist is updated after mixing. We prove the existence of equilibria for the improved polices, while it is known that there is no equilibria in the original poison and haircut policies, where blacklist is public known. Furthermore, we propose a seminal suicide policy: the one who mixes more bad coins will be punished by not having the deposit refunded. Thus, parties have no incentives to launder money by leveraging mixing coins. In effect, all three policies contrast money laundering while preserving privacy under incomplete information. Finally, we simulate and verify the validity of these policies.},

However, there are the security challenges in the existing e-health system, where the malicious doctors may collude with cloud storage service provider (CSP) to tamper with the patients’ EHRs, or directly reveal the content of EHRs to other adversaries for profit. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preserving e-health system to ensure the security and confidentiality of the patients’ EHRs. In the system, we introduce the pairing-based cryptography to generate the tamper-proof records of the EHRs and allow the patients to integrate them into the transactions deployed on the blockchain, which can make the patients’ EHRs verifiable and protect them from illegal modification. Moreover, we will design secure payment protocols by performing blockchain-based smart contracts, which can enable the patients and hospital to reliably pay for the diagnostic and storage service, respectively. Security analysis and the performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient with a limited computation overhead.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-enabled Stackelberg game model is proposed for the Quality-of-Service Optimized Link State Routing (QoS-OLSR) protocol in urban VANET. While QoS-OLSR protocols introduce game models, Stackelberg in specific, to select stable relays, the information exchanged by nodes and the selection process cannot be trusted. The introduction of Blockchain to VANET arose as a means for adding trust. However, existing works integrating blockchain do not fully exploit its capabilities in hosting verified reputations, selecting relays, or sharing monetary incentives to motivate cooperation of relays. Therefore, the proposed Stackelberg game model integrates off-chain QoS-OLSR protocol and designed on-chain smart contracts, which consists of two managers: Node Reputation Manager (NRM) and Relay Selection Game Manager (RSGM) to select relays. The proposed game model has three stages: 1) the role identification, 2) the off-chain follower incentive selection, and 3) the on-chain leader profit maximization. The first stage is for nodes identify their role in the game model; leader or follower. Then, the second stage allows followers (nodes) to calculate incentives for leaders (relays) based on off-chain exchanged QoS-OLSR messages including QoS and reputation. NRM allows verifying the reputations within the messages of nodes. The calculated incentives are deposited to RSGM as followers’ strategies. The third stage, executed on-chain in RSGM, generates the set of accepted followers for a leader reliably and forwards the deposited incentives to leaders. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate that the proposed game model outperforms in terms of leaders’ utility and followers’ payments while keeping the percentage of relays constant compared to the benchmark model. Furthermore, cost analysis confirms the feasibility and cost-efficiency of such a model.},

	abstract = {In a recent survey of academic research, Fintech related topics, broadly classified as crypto-currency studies, were by far the most researched topics in the social sciences. However, we have observed that, perhaps surprisingly, even though crypto-currencies rely on a distributed accounting ledger technology, relatively few of those studies were conducted by accounting academics. While some of the features of a system like Bitcoin do not necessarily rely on a traditional accounting knowledge, this knowledge is key in designing effective real-world distributed systems. Building on a foundational framework developed by Risius and Spohrer (2017), we provide support for their hypothesis that to date, research in this area has been predominantly of a somewhat narrow focus (i.e., based upon exploiting existing programming solutions without adequately considering the fundamental needs of users). This is particularly reflected by the abundance of Bitcoin-like crypto-currency code-bases with little or no place for business applications. We suggest that this may severely limit an appreciation of the relevance and applicability of decentralized systems, and how they may support value creation and improved governance. We provide supporting arguments for this statement by considering four applied classes of problems where a blockchain/distributed ledger can add value without requiring a crypto-currency to be an integral part of the functioning system. We note that each class of problem has been viewed previously as part of accounting issues within the legacy centralized ledger systems paradigm. We show how accounting knowledge is still relevant in the shift from centralized to decentralized ledger systems. We advance the debate on the development of (crypto-currency free) value-creating distributed ledger systems by showing that applying accounting knowledge in this area has potentially a much wider impact than that currently being applied in areas limited to auditing and operations management. We develop a typology for general distributed ledger design which assists potential users to understand the wide range of choices when developing such systems.},

In our approach, fully functional access control is provided to ensure that patients and medical institutions can control access to the data. This allows the user to promptly verify the integrity of the results after the search.

Due to the over dependence of the Third Party Auditor (TPA) and the dynamical nature of the IoT data, the traditional data integrity verification framework for cloud storage can hardly work. To satisfy the characteristics of the IoT and avoid the over dependence of the TPA, we propose a blockchain-based framework without TPA for data integrity verification in a decentralized edge-cloud storage (ECS) scenario in this paper. In our framework, we employ the Merkle tree with random challenging numbers for data integrity verification and analyze different Merkle tree structures to optimize the system performance. To solve the problem of limited resources and high real-time requirements, we further propose sampling verification and develop rational sampling strategies to make sampling verification more effective. The overhead and precision of the verification in ECS are studied by an optimal sample size strategy. Finally, a prototype system is implemented based on our framework. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The experimental results show that our schemes can effectively improve the performance of data integrity verification.},

For example, Haier Group manufactures large home appliances in China by an ecosystem made up of over four thousand mostly small teams making things and trading with each other by way of self-organized, self-negotiated lateral relationships that are smart-contract enabled, with no vertical middle managers.

Among the plethora of data sources that exist nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is recognised as a game-changer technology that expands its applicability to a huge variety of domains. Its main asset is, precisely, the data that the myriad of sensors embedded in the environment are constantly generating. The diffusion of platforms for IoT data sharing and monetisation is one of the key success factors which may help to drive the data economy and industrial transformation. In this paper, we are presenting a data sharing platform based on Blockchain, so-called Blockchain-based IoT Data Marketplace (BIDM) over which data producers and data consumers are able to share data in a decentralised and trustworthy manner. The BIDM enables a data marketplace where owners of IoT infrastructures can expose the observations that their devices generate while retaining control over who accesses each observation and directly getting revenues according to the price they have set. The evaluation that we have carried out of the BIDM’s behaviour and performance in terms of operational execution times and scalability has been the basis for the discussion that we are presenting on the shortcomings that are typically associated with the use of Blockchain technologies as enablers for data marketplaces. This discussion also includes the evaluation of the challenges that must be considered for the creation of secure and interoperable Data Spaces based on Blockchain.},

	abstract = {The blockchain-based access control mechanism (BACM) is gradually becoming an essential paradigm for solving dynamic and trusted access control problems in the open network environment. However, since the current open network environment has such features as dynamic variability and the uncertainty of user identity, most of the existing BACM cannot solve the access control problems in the current open network environment in a dynamic, flexible, proactive, efficient, and fine-grained approach. In this paper, we propose a novel BACM scheme to address such problems. Specifically, we first design a new, proactive, and fine-grained access control model, by utilizing the dynamicity and fine-grain of the attribute-based access control model, flexibility shown by the trust evaluation mechanism in evaluating the trust level of users, and proactivity shown by the game evaluation mechanism in curbing malicious users who suddenly launch malicious access requests. Second, based on the above access control model, we propose a dynamic, flexible, and proactive BACM for the current open network environment, exploiting the trustworthiness and transparency that the smart contract and the transaction mechanism in blockchain technology show during program execution. Further, a double sliding storage window is built, guaranteeing accurate data acquisition by BACM while efficiently allowing it to acquire time-sensitive data during the permission management process. Meanwhile, a pre-authorization concept is introduced to improve the efficiency and flexibility of BACM in processing access control problems. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed BACM scheme satisfies the simple security issue and the simple availability issue. Experiments on a real user trust record dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed BACM scheme in evaluating and deciding on access requests and the superiorities over most existing schemes in dynamicity, fine granularity, flexibility, and proactivity.},

	abstract = {In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed energy (DE) transactions exist in various scenarios. This paper attempts to improve the intelligence, real-timeliness, and security of the direct transaction between DE generation companies (DEGCs) and users, and reduce the default frequency of distributed power (DP) transactions. For these purposes, a P2P DE transaction model for the IIoT was proposed based on blockchain. Firstly, a blockchain-based distributed energy peer-to-peer transaction framework is constructed, which is more suitable for generalized energy transactions based on typical transaction scenarios of the IIoT. Using credit value evaluation and smart contracts to ensure the transparency, openness, and non-tampering of credit scores. On this basis, the energy currency reward mechanism is used to promote the trustworthiness of transaction nodes and maintain transaction security. Finally, the P2P direct transaction based on credit value was designed to improve the transaction efficiency and security. Through case analysis, the DE transaction model for the IIoT, which is based on the credit value of the blockchain, supports fast and frequent energy transactions, as it overcomes the confirmation delays of energy blockchain transactions. The proposed model improves the efficiency of DE transactions in the IIoT, effectively suppresses default frequency, and maintains the order of DE market in the IIoT.},

	abstract = {The current advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is revolutionizing conventional farming operations into precision agriculture. The agricultural UAVs combined with IoT use an open channel i.e., the Internet to assist cultivators with data collection, processing, monitoring, and making correct decisions on the farm. However, the use of the Internet opens up a wide range of challenges such as security (e.g., performing cyber-attacks), risk of data privacy (e.g., data poisoning and inference attacks), etc. The usage of current conventional centralized security measures has limitations in terms of a single point of failure, verifiability, traceability, and scalability. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural UAVs. The proposed SP2F framework has two main engines, a two-level privacy engine, and a deep learning-based anomaly detection engine. In the two-level privacy engine, a blockchain, and smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) is designed for data authentication, and to mitigate data poisoning attacks. A Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) is applied for transforming data into a new encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection engine, a Stacked Long-Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) is used to train and evaluate the results of the proposed two-level privacy engine using two publicly accessible IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet. Finally, based on thorough analysis, and comparison, we identify that the SP2F framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both non-blockchain and blockchain frameworks.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology offers numerous fields of application, especially for supply chain management (SCM), as it could supersede the middleman activities in many transaction-based processes along the supply chain. Blockchain technology has a disruptive impact on supply chain design and operations, making the exploration of future application scenarios of great importance. However, knowledge in this field remains scarce, despite the subject's strategical value. This empirical study addresses this gap by conducting an interdisciplinary Delphi survey. Long-term judgments from an international panel of 108 designated experts from academia, industry, and politics/associations with different context-related backgrounds (blockchain, SCM, hybrid functions) were systematically analyzed. The results reveal prospective scenarios how blockchains will be applied in SCM by 2035 and which SCM-specific obstacles need to be solved in advance. One key finding reveals that even though blockchain technology is said to enable transactions between untrusted parties, trust-related advantages of blockchain technology are not directly transferable to SCM without additional conditions. Counterintuitively, active trust management between supply chain partners will still be needed. Nonetheless, this research reveals that blockchain technology will be strongly applied in SCM by 2035 and thus provides beneficial orientation and stimulating perspectives for decision-makers in the field.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new generalized recommender system framework based on Blockchain technology called BC-Rec. Blockchain technology is a decentralized data-sharing ledger across a large network of untrusted entities. The presented idea is motivated by the fact that e-business platforms share common data about users, items, and sellers. In other words, a new user/seller in a particular e-business platform may be a trusted user/seller in other e-business platforms. Also, a new item in a particular marketplace may have a historical record in other marketplaces. The core idea behind BC-Rec is to adopt Blockchain technology to share the data required to generate the recommendation between the e-business platforms. BC-Rec architecture is designed based on a permission-less public Blockchain network, Ethereum Blockchain. The key feature of BC-Rec is the smart contract deployed to determine the agreement between certain entities on the Blockchain. We expect that the proposed framework will help alleviate cold-start, sparsity, and shilling attack problems.},

Since each block has a limit on the number of transactions, miners usually prioritise transactions by selecting the most profitable ones. However, miners are uncertain about the exact income and the exact cost of executing transactions. Thus, they are not able to make informed decisions of which transactions to select and execute in order to maximise their profits. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty that miners perceive about the income and the cost of executing transactions and the impact of this uncertainty on the profit miners can gain. To achieve this aim, we design a simulation model, collect the input data for the model, implement the model and run an experiment on the model. Our simulation results show that the uncertainty miners perceive about the cost of executing transactions has a significant impact on the block profit. On the contrary, our results do not show a significant impact of the income uncertainty on the block profit.},

An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved. Finally, we implement the protocols, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.},

A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the application of blockchain in the construction domain found that there are few studies and applications of blockchain in construction practices, and most of the current research involves qualitative studies only.

Proximity Radio Access Network (P-RAN), which was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), expands the cellular structure from base station to intelligent terminal equipment through device to device (D2D) technology, which provides a cost-effective deployment solution for the 5G and 6G. The extensive deployment of P-RAN solution should be based on the active participation of a large number of distributed intelligent equipment users. Fair, reasonable and credible incentive solution is the key to realize the sustainable operation of this distributed system. This paper introduces a technical solution that applying blockchain technology to design P-RAN operating and incentive mechanism. Through blockchain technology, the current centralized P-RAN operation and incentive can be achieved in point-to-point way. By utilizing blockchain-based identity authentication and asymmetric key pairs, user and relay can confirm and sign the network usage information in sequence to reduce disputes. The abstract of all transactions related to P-RAN services can be recorded on blockchain immutably as the calculation basis of relay rewards. Through smart contracts and P-RAN incentive policy, relays that provide more and higher quality P-RAN service will be rewarded more, which can help to create positive feedback in this decentralized system. The tokens awarded to relays will be able to exchange through the blockchain network for the increase of the whole ecosystem utility.

Also, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices connect with the healthcare systems, and the healthcare sector application software further communicates with the IT industry. The blockchain-based IoT systems have significantly impacted the healthcare sector by enhancing security, privacy, transparency, and efficiency, providing better business opportunities.

Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design.

The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less “digital twins” for industrial IOT applications.},

	abstract = {At present, various types of code vulnerabilities lead to a huge workload of detection. Although multi-party cooperation detection methods can be applied to improve efficiency, common crowdsourcing models are difficult to guarantee the privacy of code and identity. We design a code and identity privacy vulnerability crowdsourcing detection system ConGradetect. The system is built on a blockchain and solves code privacy issues, identity privacy issues, and reward preemption issues during the crowdsourcing detection process of vulnerabilities. In ConGradetect, users have a dynamic fake identity, which ensures that the identity of the user is not exposed, thereby avoiding the problem of information exposure caused by data accumulation. In the meantime, ConGradetect uses a local code granulation tool to perform off-line code cutting for task publishers, and uses proxy re-encryption to allocate task code blocks to ensure that the complete original code is only known to the code owner. When the task is received, a trusted key conversion is performed using smart contract. Further, we propose a method for anonymous verification of the binding relationship between task and user to prevent reward preemption and ensure that task performers can obtain corresponding legal benefits. Finally, we run the system on the Ethereum blockchain and test its performance. After testing, the feasibility of ConGradetect is proved.},

	abstract = {With the aid of advancing technologies, the healthcare sector is improving more swiftly than ever, yet there are still many unexplored areas and there is always potential for improvement. Deep Learning (DL), blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), three of the most revolutionary technologies, have aided replace conventional practice employed in the healthcare industry with more sophisticated and efficient procedures. In this research, we propose DON-B-STRESSED (DBS), an innovative framework which integrates DL, blockchain and IoMT technologies to provide a method for the early detection of stress in users donning IoMT devices. Long-term stress, indeed, is well-known to have profound consequences on human wellbeing; hence the need for automated solutions for continual stress monitoring. DON-B-STRESSED stands for DON a Blockchain-based, Secure, Timely, REliable System for StrEss Detection: the premise behind this is that if the above-mentioned technologies can be combined, a system that employs IoMT for users' data collection, DL to properly predict patients' stress levels, and smart contracts deployed on blockchain to ensure secure transactions and health checks, the well-known concerns of harmful effects of long-term stress might be avoided. By using multimodal data from both a chest- and a wrist-worn IoMT device, we have developed a tailored, secure, accurate yet fast real-time system for the early detection of stress signs. The DL part has been evaluated on WESAD, a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, reaching an accuracy of more than 99\% with LOSO generalization scheme. Furthermore, the scalability and reliability of DON-B-STRESSED are shown by comparison with the findings of past research.},

	abstract = {Data- and knowledge-driven service-oriented smart maintenance decision-making is becoming a current research topic in complex multi-component systems. In it, the comprehensive data and knowledge from different stakeholders such as users, OEMs, and service providers contribute to determining the optimal decision-making schemes. However, the traditional centralized systems or platforms lead to the reluctant cross-organization knowledge sharing for each stakeholder. Meanwhile, although the promising blockchain technology is fit to solve the centralized sharing problems, it little considers the service-oriented maintenance decision-making (SOMD) processes. Moreover, it also ignores the collaborative sharing relationships that generate requests, induce services and respond knowledge among different stakeholders. Thus, in order to solve these problems, this paper focuses on the SOMD processes, and innovatively proposes a decision-making oriented collaborative knowledge sharing framework and multi-channel distributed blockchain network MKShareNet. The network architecture, lifecycle smart contracts, token reward mechanisms, and collaborative knowledge transaction operation logics are all designed. Finally, the prototype system on complex CNC honing machining tools is implemented and the collaborative sharing is verified. It shows that the proposed MKShareNet and system could effectively implement the sequential and incentive knowledge sharing among different stakeholders for maintenance planning.},

We propose a blockchain-based data-sharing framework called EdgeShare for edge data-sharing services among heterogeneous network domains by introducing a two-layer overlay network topology and an edge computing paradigm that can dramatically alleviate system pressure and reduce communication delays to improve data-sharing efficiency. Under such framework, a novel smart contract is designed to construct access control strategies with dissimilar granularities to achieve different levels of data access control in an undeniable and automated manner. All IIoT data-sharing activities are recorded in a blockchain for secured transaction logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeShare prototype and conduct extensive experiments and analyses to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals.

	abstract = {Objective The creation and exchange of patients’ Electronic Healthcare Records have developed significantly in the last decade. Patients’ records are however distributed in data silos across multiple healthcare facilities, posing technical and clinical challenges that may endanger patients’ safety. Current healthcare sharing systems ensure interoperability of patients’ records across facilities, but they have limits in presenting doctors with the clinical context of the data in the records. We design and implement a platform for managing provenance tracking of Electronic Healthcare Records based on blockchain technology, compliant with the latest healthcare standards and following the patient-informed consent preferences. Methods The platform leverages two pillars: the use of international standards such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), Health Level Seven International (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to achieve interoperability, and the use of a provenance creation process that by-design, avoids personal data storage within the blockchain. The platform consists of: (1) a smart contract implemented within the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain that manages provenance according to the W3C PROV for medical document in standardised formats (e.g. a CDA document, a FHIR resource, a DICOM study, etc.); (2) a Java Proxy that intercepts all the document submissions and retrievals for which provenance shall be evaluated; (3) a service used to retrieve the PROV document. Results We integrated our decentralised platform with the SpiritEHR engine, an enterprise-grade healthcare system, and we stored and retrieved the available documents in the Mandel's sample CDA repository,11See https://github.com/jmandel/sample\_ccdas. which contained no protected health information. Using a cloud-based blockchain solution, we observed that the overhead added to the typical processing time of reading and writing medical data is in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, the integration of the Proxy at the level of exchanged messages in EHR systems allows transparent usage of provenance data in multiple health computing domains such as decision making, data reconciliation, and patient consent auditing. Conclusions By using international healthcare standards and a cloud-based blockchain deployment, we delivered a solution that can manage provenance of patients’ records via transparent integration within the routine operations on healthcare data.},

However, the security and trust of traditional centralized system is insufficient and data tampering is easy to occur, which leads to data distrustful. The characteristics of blockchain, such as traceable and tamper-proof, can solve the issue of data trust. However, the access threshold of the blockchain is high. In order to reduce the technical difficulty, in this article, a universal BaaS platform (called TrustedBaaS) which has high flexibility and scalability was designed based on consortium blockchain, it can support user-defined configuration according to requirements of users. Afterwards we described the process of executing a transaction in detail and discussed the core protocols and algorithms of the BaaS platform, which includes identity authentication, consensus algorithm, data protection protocol, smart contract and on-blockchain and off-blockchain data collaboration. Furthermore, we implemented TrustedBaaS based on Hyperledger Fabric and a vehicular information management application platform and a transaction settlement application platform were configured based on TrustedBaaS. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the TrustedBaaS and compared it with current public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The evaluation showed that the designed TrustedBaaS has better performance than the existing public blockchain platforms. Moreover, it is common distributed higher-level trusted platform which provides configurable and extensible functions and solves the problem that the access threshold of blockchain technology is high.},

World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that nearly 1035\% of the drugs, i.e., one out of ten medicines produced in the least developing countries, are counterfeit and have serious side effects on human lives. The upsurge in online and Internet-based pharmacies has made the safety and security of the drug supply chain process more intricate and complicated. This research proposes a new and novel track and trace blockchain-enabled Medledger system that leverages the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using chaincodes (smart contracts). The proposed Medledger system helps to efficiently and securely execute drug supply chain transactions in a fabric enabled private permissioned distributed network of different pharmaceutical stakeholders. Our proposed traceability solution diminishes the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transaction records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security that reduces the likelihood of meddling with stored data on the Medledger. Chaincodes are designed, coded, and implemented using sequence diagrams to govern and control the interaction amongst the participating stakeholders in the drug supply chain ecosystem. The proposed system perpetually stores and records all activities, events, and transactions on the blockchain's immutable Medledger linked with peer-to-peer decentralized file systems such as IPFS, Swarm, filecoin, etc. for storing and providing maximum transparency and traceability. We provide an insight into some of the ongoing implementation challenges for the hyperledger fabric platform. Finally, we discuss open challenges that serve as future research directions to improve the drug traceability solutions further.},

Instead of keeping investing in costly cloud infrastructures, trading resources among different cloud service providers is another cost-effective way to expand the capacity. The key is to design an effective market-based mechanism to facilitate resource trading and motivate high-quality service provisioning. This paper proposes a distributed Feedback-based Combinatorial Multi-unit Double Auction mechanism backed by blockchain to establish a cloud resource market that not only produces high social welfare but also motivates participants to provide high-quality service. We first design an improved greedy allocation mechanism with a novel sorting method to achieve high social welfare. Then we propose a feedback-based second-price pricing mechanism to limit strategic manipulation. Finally, we design a feedback system combined with the auction mechanism to motivate high-quality service provisioning. All these mechanisms are implemented in the form of smart contracts on a consortium blockchain which guarantees the effectiveness of the feedback system and eliminates the dependence on a central auctioneer. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed auction mechanism maintains budget balance, individual rationality, truthfulness on the buyer side and computational efficiency. In comparison with other popular mechanisms, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate higher efficiency of the allocation mechanism, good limitation on strategic manipulation of the pricing mechanism and effectiveness of the feedback system.},

	abstract = {The country's entire population depends on agriculture, so it is absolutely essential to the economy. Its links and interactions with all of the country's relevant enterprises enable it to benefit from every part of the country. When gauging the social and economic well-being of a country, an agricultural base must be substantial. Agriculture is by far the main source of employment in most countries. It has many components, including supply chain management, crop insurance, and shipping of goods, which requires numerous unverified parties, such as farmers, retailers, customers, and wholesalers (assessor, surveyors). A case could be made that due to the presence of a middle man (i.e. human beings or human-operated agencies) crucial issues such as accessibility, expediency, security, and immutability have been raised. As a result, financial loss, crop contamination, and waste have occurred. Blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, is a decentralized shareholding ledger that collects data from multiple parties involved in the Bitcoin network transactions. For this reason, the Bitcoin network relies on the Blockchain to keep track of transaction history and other transaction-related information, such as the transaction's completion, the addresses of the sender(s) and the recipient(s), and information about whether the transaction was successful. Donors can be confident that the money will be given to only one organization. To keep information private, every piece of data is encrypted on the Blockchain. This article describes a blockchain-based agriculture infrastructure in which data regarding farmers and farming is safely and securely recorded.},

	abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.},

AttriChain realizes on-chain access control and distributed identity governance by allowing users to create transactions anonymously using their transaction keys and their attributes. It provides unlinkability and anonymity of transactions belonging to legitimate users whereas provides accountability for those whom other members in the network regard as questionable or malicious. The design of threshold traceability of anonymous transactions allows network members to trace transactions back to the sender without violating the decentralized property of blockchain. In AttriChain, the spontaneous tracing of misbehaviors in the network distributes the power of identity governance to multiple independent tracing members instead of depending on single-point management. It significantly increases user privacy and autonomy in a permissioned network and facilitates auditing at the same time. We define the functionality and the protocol of AttriChain in the universal composable model. We also provide an implementation of an AttriChain prototype for performance analysis.},

This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the published work on how blockchain technology will impact accounting in general, but AI-enabled auditing specifically. The purpose is to investigate how blockchain technology can improve transparency and trust in accounting practice and how professionals can use blockchain data to improve decision-making, based on the qualities of immutability, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) blockchain data. The multi-party validation of blockchain protocols adds real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efficiency. This review summarizes four themes emerging from the literature focusing on how blockchain technology has changed record-keeping in accounting: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry-accounting and continuous auditing. The research interprets the findings using agency theory and stakeholder theory to advance how using blockchain to mitigate information asymmetry and improve stakeholder collaborations is understood. The investigation also summarizes the challenges and clarifies organizations’ reasons to be cautious about adopting blockchain. Lastly, the study suggests that future researchers use this study in two ways that enrich blockchain literature: first, to apply the themes and answer the questions identified within this review to improve the business methods of practitioners and policymakers; and second, to encourage stakeholders such as practitioners, system designers/developers, and policymakers to collaborate in designing blockchain ecosystems that suit accounting and auditing as they transform digitally.},

Modern RSs are challenged to go beyond their traditional role of predicting user preferences to efficiently provide reliable, carefully personalized, and highly accurate recommendations.

Our goal in this paper is to survey the literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC), focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a rich set of pointers to future research directions.},

While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: “You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical” reveals that this is a futile exercise.

The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious – and there is already ICO litigation on foot.

	abstract = {Deep learning, for image data processing, has been widely used to solve a variety of problems related to medical practices. However, researchers are constantly struggling to introduce ever efficient classification models. Recent studies show that deep learning can perform better and generalize well when trained using a large amount of data. Organizations such as hospitals, testing labs, research centers, etc. can share their data and collaboratively build a better learning model. Every organization wants to retain the privacy of their data, while on the other hand, these organizations want accurate and efficient learning models for various applications. The concern for privacy in medical data limits the sharing of data among multiple organizations due to some ethical and legal issues. To retain privacy and enable data sharing, we present a unique method that combines locally learned deep learning models over the blockchain to improve the prediction of lung cancer in health-care systems by filling the defined gap. There are several challenges involved in sharing that data while maintaining privacy. In this paper, we identify and address such challenges. The contribution of our work is four-fold: (i) We propose a method to secure medical data by only sharing the weights of the trained deep learning model via smart contract. (ii) To deal with different sized computed tomography (CT) images from various sources, we adopted the Bat algorithm and data augmentation to reduce the noise and overfitting for the global learning model. (iii) We distribute the local deep learning model wights to the blockchain decentralized network to train a global model. iv) We propose a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to estimate the region of interest (ROI) in theCT images. An extensive empirical study has been conducted to verify the significance of our proposed method for better prediction of cancer in the early stage. Experimental results of the proposed model can show that our proposed technique can detect the lung cancer nodules and also achieve better performance.},

	abstract = {Intuitive context-aware algorithms called "Next Basket recommender systems" improve consumers' decision-making by offering suggestions for potential products they might like to buy next based on their past behaviour. Even though it is now well-known, this field is still young. Many different industries, such as e-commerce and healthcare, employ recommender systems. Even though these datasets frequently contain sensitive data, most recommender systems place a greater emphasis on the models' accuracy than on their security and privacy. We investigate this concept in the context of the sequential recommendation job known as Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), whose objective is to provide a user with a selection of goods based on their purchasing behaviour. A recent state-of-the-art technology is blockchain. Blockchain creates a trusted environment without the involvement of a third party, thus ensuring privacy and security. It is designed in such a way that it is enough in itself to create trust. In this paper, we propose and assimilate an authentic blockchain privacy system for a fortified user recommendation system for the Next Basket Recommendation. With next basket proposals based on blockchain for safe transactions and distributed context-based processing, this suggested system enables the development of decentralized RSs. Through the use of atomic swaps on the blockchain, this effort aims to provide viable solutions that can lead to fair procedures. It places a focus on effective data deletion procedures that preserve user privacy and transfers the issue of decremental learning to the Next Basket system, a more secure and wise recommendation. By incorporating blockchain into recommender systems (RSs), which contain smart contracts in the main blockchain-based RS protocol, it is feasible to create safe trust-based systems with the benefit of multi-party computation backed by blockchain. Additionally, it aids in protecting user information since blockchain enables the secure processing of customer data in online portals.},

	abstract = {Log files are the primary source of recording users, applications and protocols, activities in the cloud ecosystem. Cloud forensic investigators can use log evidence to ascertain when, why and how a cyber adversary or an insider compromised a system by establishing the crime scene and reconstructing how the incident occurred. However, digital evidence acquisition in a cloud ecosystem is complicated and proven difficult, even with modern forensic acquisition toolkit. The multi-tenancy, Geo-location and Service-Level Agreement have added another layer of complexity in acquiring digital log evidence from a cloud ecosystem. In order to mitigate these complexities of evidence acquisition in the cloud ecosystem, we need a framework that can forensically maintain the trustworthiness and integrity of log evidence. In this paper, we design and implement a Blockchain Cloud Forensic Logging (BCFL) framework, using a Design Science Research Methodological (DSRM) approach. BCFL operates primarily in four stages: (1) Process transaction logs using Blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT). (2) Use a Blockchain smart contract to maintain the integrity of logs and establish a clear chain of custody. (3) Validate all transaction logs. (4) Maintain transaction log immutability. BCFL will also enhance and strengthen compliance with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The results from our single case study will demonstrate that BCFL will mitigate the challenges and complexities faced by digital forensics investigators in acquiring admissible digital evidence from the cloud ecosystem. Furthermore, an instantaneous performance monitoring of the proposed Blockchain cloud forensic logging framework was evaluated. BCFL will ensure trustworthiness, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of the log evidence in the cloud.},

	abstract = {The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) brings opportunities for electric power transactions for users to be able to trade their excess electricity. Blockchain technology is envisaged as an electricity exchange platform to minimise the time gap and cost in the trading process. We propose a public electric power exchange service network with a gateway-based privacy-preserving scheme to implement authentication and data encryption for EV charging and discharging from grid peers. A novel consensus mechanism Proof-of-Benefit (PoB) is designed to support automated smart contracts for electric power trading, in which a benefit number generation algorithm is proposed to select the leader for the transaction validation. Meanwhile, the authentication strategy ensures only the participated nodes with valid identities can access the consensus process, and the data encryption is applied to avoid EV behaviour analysis based upon plain transaction flows that would otherwise be exposed in the network. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, a public electric power exchange service platform with a PoB consensus mechanism achieves a higher scalability and lower grid load variance while maintaining a high accuracy rate of correct electric power transactions against Sybil attacks and a faster (lower time consumption) authentication process when compared with other blockchain-enabled authentication methods (e.g. FairAccess, Bubbles of trust, and so on) used as the baseline.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city, prevalent pub/sub (publish/subscribe) streaming systems have been increasingly employed as upstream middleware layer in multi-tenant edge clouds, and feed large volume of data gathered from IoT devices of different tenants into downstream systems (e.g., data analytics and warehouse). A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain. Our security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that BPS outperforms the state-of-the-art pub/sub streaming system Kafka in security with minimal performance overhead.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46\% uniqueness and 2.38\% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient tokenization is a novel approach that allows anonymous patient-level linkage across healthcare facilities, minimizing the risk of breaching protected health information in health information exchange (HIE). Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows virtual disintermediation and automatization of property transactions, which might help to design future platforms, intended to facilitate cross-border transactions within the EU and worldwide. To this end, users of these blockchain-based platforms may create the so-called “digital tokens” or “colored coins” that aim to represent rights over different types of “real world” assets. By transferring a digital token, the parties aim to transfer the ownership or other property rights over the asset represented by the token without the intervention of traditional intermediaries, such as real estate conveyancers, land registrars or notaries specializing in real estate. However, this new technological tool raises several questions in the field of private law, such as the legal nature of the token, how the effective transfer of the property rights operates or how ownership rules may be applied in this decentralized environment (e.g. rights and duties of the token holder). Some of the issues at stake have only been tentatively addressed by both lawmakers and academia. In light of this research gap, this paper addresses these controversial issues from both a private law and a comparative perspective, and proposes a model to tokenize the right of usufruct over chattels and real estate, analyzing its legal viability and limitations across six jurisdictions. The paper concludes that private law rules may be adapted to the tokenization of property rights, which may contribute to the establishment of a digital market for the trading of asset-backed tokens worldwide.},

First, we analyze the limitations in existing SOBP-based schemes, such as the one-malicious model (Strong Assumption), a secure channel (Insufficiency), and a trusted server (Centralization). Then, we propose a novel blockchain-based system for SOBP based on a permissioned version (i.e., a blockchain ledger maintained by some permissioned nodes), designed to efficiently address the limitations. Finally, we prove the security of our proposed approach in the one untrusted program model and implement it on Ethereum (an open-source blockchain system) to show its utility.},

	abstract = {The high energy consumption of HPC systems is an obstacle for ever-growing systems. Unfortunately, energy consumption does not decrease linearly with reduced workload; therefore, energy conservation techniques have been deployed on various levels which steer the overall system. While the overall saving of energy is useful, the price of energy is not necessarily proportional to the consumption. Particularly with renewable energies, there are occasions in which the price is significantly lower. The potential of saving energy costs when using smart contracts with energy providers is lacking research. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the potential savings when applying cost-aware schedulers to data center workloads while considering power contracts that allow for dynamic (hourly) pricing. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) the theoretic assessment of cost savings; (2) the development of a simulator to replay batch scheduler traces which supports flexible energy cost models and various cost-aware scheduling algorithms. This allows to approximate the energy costs savings of data centers for various scenarios including off-peak and hourly budgeted energy prices as provided by the energy spot market. An evaluation is conducted with four annual job traces from the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ). The theoretic analysis indicates a cost savings for 4–8\% when shutting down unused client nodes, and 6–20\% with hourly cost models and optimal scheduling. The experimental validation of a practicable scheduler increases the accuracy against the theoretical best case analysis. As expected, a cost-efficient scheduling algorithm that is fed with the information about future energy costs shifts the jobs to the timeslots where the job execution is cheaper and reduces the energy expenditure, yet increases the waiting times of pending jobs. However, the expected savings for this effort are not justifiable compared to the simple strategy of turning off the unused nodes. Additionally, we compare the cost savings to the total costs of ownership showing that smaller systems with on-demand provisioning yield better cost efficiency.},

	abstract = {Business Process Management provides concepts for enterprises to design, document and execute their business processes. Involved artefacts establish the basis for a profound enhancement of processes, like performance improvements or a substantiate assignment of employees (resources) to tasks. These artefacts comprise process models for documentation purposes or Workflow Management Systems for executing processes. Those concepts are adopted well within single companies but are barely implemented for inter-organizational processes reasoned in a lack of trust between participating business partners. For instance, questions like who the host of the workflow engine is and thus have sovereignty over the process execution remains open. Besides expensive third parties, we believe that Blockchain Technology bears potential to solve the lack of trust due to automated consensus finding. We present a Blockchain-based process engine guaranteeing a tamper-proof execution, which is both, highly scalable regarding the size of process models as well as capable of considering employees captured in the organizational perspective of the process model. Comparable approaches suffer from lack of trustworthiness either, are not applicable for large process models, or do not include organizational concerns.},
