	abstract = {With the rise of digital images in our daily lives, there is a growing need to provide an image trading market where people can monetize their images and get desired images at prices that fit their budget. Those images are usually uploaded and stored onto centralized image trading service providers' servers and the transactions for image trading are processed by these providers. Unfortunately, transaction unfairness and users' privacy breaches have become major concerns since the service providers might be untrusted and able to manipulate image trading prices and infer users' private information. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address the unfairness issue by using the decentralized ledger technique and smart contract, but users' privacy protection is not considered. In this paper, we propose a fair and privacy-preserving protocol that supports image fair exchange and protect user privacy. In particular, we exploit blockchain and Merkle tree to construct a fair image trading protocol with low communication overhead based on smart contract, which serves as an external judge that resolves disputes between buyers and sellers in image transactions. Moreover, we extend a popular short group signature scheme to protect users' identity privacy, prevent linkability of transactions from being inferred, and ensure traceability of malicious users who may sell fake images and/or refuse to pay. Finally, we design and build a practical and open-source image trading system to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in real-world applications. © 2021 Le Wang et al.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As computer programs run on top of blockchain, smart contracts have proliferated a myriad of decentralized applications while bringing security vulnerabilities, which may cause huge financial losses. Thus, it is crucial and urgent to detect the vulnerabilities of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers for smart contracts are still inefficient to detect sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific vulnerable transaction sequences to trigger. To address this challenge, we propose a novel vulnerability-guided fuzzer based on reinforcement learning, namely RLF, for generating vulnerable transaction sequences to detect such sophisticated vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In particular, we firstly model the process of fuzzing smart contracts as a Markov decision process to construct our reinforcement learning framework. We then creatively design an appropriate reward with consideration of both vulnerability and code coverage so that it can effectively guide our fuzzer to generate specific transaction sequences to reveal vulnerabilities, especially for the vulnerabilities related to multiple functions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RLF's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our RLF outperforms state-of-the-art vulnerability-detection tools (e.g., detecting 8%-69% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes).  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {With opportunities brought by the Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to maintain concurrency and privacy when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices are involved. Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user’s environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system’s performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {A complex web of supply chains is a common feature of construction projects. With the different types of parties involved in a project and the amount of paperwork generated, the supply chain process can be time-consuming, an easy target for fraud and is prone to human errors. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can transform, simplify and make a network of information more secure. In the context of the supply chain, digitalised documents and real-time information can lead to cost-savings in any operation. Its embedded feature of transparency and integrity proves itself to be reliable. In addition, there are two less widely considered advantages that are particularly suitable for applying in the administration and management of the complex web of supply chains in the construction industry. The two additional advantages are dispute avoidance and dispute resolution, which will be discussed in this paper. The use of blockchain in supply chains carries legal issues. This could be a contributing factor to its slower rate of adoption than widely anticipated after the rapid emergence of its first application in the financial system of cryptocurrency, commonly known as Bitcoin. This paper identifies and proposes solutions to three key legal issues arising from the use of blockchain technology in supply chains. They are (a) restricted use of smart contracts to prescribed outcomes only; (b) concerns relating to access and ownership of using a shared blockchain platform; and (c) multi-jurisdiction concerns over where governing laws apply. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the business barriers that influence cost of implementing unmanned aerial system (UAS) and its suitability for a decentralised system. UAS, or drone, plays a role of data provider to architectural, engineering and construction professionals within a decentralised system. However, the expectations in the execution and test of the effectiveness of the UAS is often not met. The reasons for these fails are not well elaborated in the literature. Hence, the study investigates the barriers and cost analysis of UAS that can be used for a decentralised case, in which the UAS data are useful for multiple stakeholders, and provide illustration of the interactions within this approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is part of a longitudinal project by using a qualitative method of interviewing 24 participants involved in the process of application of drones in the country of the Dominican Republic. The open-ended semi-structured interviews were composed for questions regarding the application of UAS, barriers and business implications. The data gathered were transcribed and used thematic analysis for its interpretation. Later, conclusions of the barriers of UAS implementation in the organisation were analysed and a cost model was developed to identify a viable scenario. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the barriers and economic considerations faced in the implementation process of UAS. In this research, 16 barriers in the implementation process at the management level, 8 types of cases of business relationships and 13 business models were identified. Furthermore, recommendations were made about being the accountability of the dimensions and recurrent visits to the projects handled by the portfolio of the organisations. Research limitations/implications: Blockchain system is supported by UAS data and its tests require skills and resources that were outside of the scope of the main research intend regarding UAS implementation in construction. Furthermore, as these technologies are still under development, the assessment of the decentralised system, smart contract and swarm technology was addressed conceptually and further research are encouraged in this field. Practical implications: The paper includes barriers to consider before implementation, business implications, project examples and cost structure developed. Furthermore, the findings are fit theoretically into the context of a decentralised system. It was understood and contemplated that monitoring in open and outdoor spaces is the suitable approach for UAS implementations for decentralised system. The trend of decentralised autonomous organisations for transparency and efficiency of human tasks provides the foundations of human–robot interactions as well as the role of tokenisation of assets into the cyberspace. Therefore, the paper brings managers and technicians the implications for the future-proofing the implementation of UAS. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of the implications of cost and the suitable scenarios for return of investment in the UAS implementation in the current stage of the technology development. In addition, the paper makes reference to decentralised systems, smart contracts and swarm technology as options in which reality capture technologies are essential for construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Medical data sharing is of great significance in promoting smart medicine. However, the heterogeneity of information systems used by various medical institutions makes sharing difficult. In addition, since medical data involves a great deal of sensitive information, sharing it could easily lead to the leakage of personal privacy. Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time. Furthermore, we carry out an extensive analysis to show the high security and efficiency of our proposed scheme. Finally, we build a Quorum consortium blockchain on the Tencent Cloud and deploy smart contracts on the chain to simulate transactions in our scheme. The experiment results indicate the proposed scheme achieves good feasibility. © 2022 Duo Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {Hospitals provide diverse tasks essential for the delivery of patient care and are comprised of many functional units. This makes healthcare projects in construction highly complex among other types of building projects due to the specific regulations, multiple functions it must provide, complicated mechanical and electrical systems, and so on. This complexity embodies potential risk events during its construction, which not only influences the completion of the project but can impact the patients’ safety and health conditions even after the project is finished. To prevent such outcomes, risk management is a crucial process that can identify, evaluate, and properly mitigate risks along the project lifecycle. A key aspect of risk management is that it requires the interaction and contribution from multiple stakeholders of the project. Various frameworks and tools that enable collaborative management of risks among multiple stakeholders have been developed in the past. However, the developed frameworks are not suitable in the sense that it does not protect the confidentiality of individual inputs from the stakeholders. Moreover, these frameworks are centralized systems, which can bring issues related to the security and transparency of the information that is being stored. Blockchain technology is an emergent distributed ledger technology (DLT) that can provide solutions to the listed problems found in centralized systems. It is a novel system that records information on a decentralized, distributed ledger, where transactions are constantly duplicated and updated. This study explores the applicability of blockchain technology for healthcare risk management. The key functional elements of blockchain that can resolve the challenges faced by prior risk management frameworks have been identified and discussed. Based on the discussions, a conceptual information management model for managing healthcare project risks on a blockchain has been conceived. The development of the initial prototype has been explained. The research study illustrates the process, benefits, and limitations of adopting the blockchain technology for collaborative risk management in healthcare projects. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is evolving across the globe and is being looked upon as a definite part of the future. Blockchain is often associated with bitcoin and finance's domain. But over the last decade, this backend technology to bitcoin has spread its association in almost all domains that we can think of. Further to this, smart contracts are making the blockchain ecosystem better. Other evolving technologies like Internet-of-things, Industrial Internet-of-things, Cyber physical systems are also making their onset on the global platform. Smart buildings link Internet-of-things connectivity, sensors and the cloud to remotely supervise and assure efficient heating- air conditioning, lighting and security systems etc to improve efficiency and overall sustainability. The global buildings sector over the next 40 years is expected to add 230 billion square meters of fresh construction, i.e., adding the equivalent of Paris every week. Thus integrating these technologies right at the onset, before they grow in isolation, is a coveted need today. This paper proposes a prototype to simulate architecture and discusses how blockchain enabled smart buildings can further expedite automation, security and transparency.

To solve these problems, this paper designs a supply chain system based on blockchain. With the help of trade chain and information chain platforms, an overall framework of the supply chain system is constructed. By formulating platform interaction rules, the system information exchange format is standardized to ensure the stability and efficiency of system interaction. Smart contracts are used to manage supply chain system transactions and information interactions to achieve efficient and convenient information sharing, ensuring the security and reliability of supply chain information. The comprehensive performance of the system is evaluated through experiments. Experimental results indicate that while the system realizes the basic functions of the supply chain, it can promote the sharing of information between participants and improve its efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {We show how a particular variety of hierarchical nets, where the firing of a transition in the parent net must correspond to an execution in some child net, can be modelled utilizing a functorial semantics from a free category – representing the parent net – to the category of sets and spans between them. This semantics can be internalized via Grothendieck construction, resulting in the category of executions of a Petri net representing the semantics of the overall hierarchical net. We conclude the paper by giving an engineering-oriented overview of how our model of hierarchical nets can be implemented in a transaction-based smart contract environment. © 2021 Open Publishing Association.

	abstract = {The usage of blockchain technology has been significantly expanded with smart contracts and blockchain <italic>oracles</italic>. While smart contracts enables to automate the execution of an agreement between untrusted parties, oracles provide smart contracts with data external to a given blockchain, i.e., off-chain data. However, the validity and accuracy of such off-chain data can be questionable that compromises the transparency and immutability chacteristics of blockchain. Despite many studies on the trustworthiness of blockchain oracles, more precisely, off-chain data, their solutions are often &#x2018;short-sighted&#x2019; and dependent on binary decisions. In this paper, we present a novel graph-based profiling method to determine the trustworthiness of blockchain oracles. We construct a graph with oracles as nodes and cumulative average discrepancies of validity and accuracy of data as edge weights. Our profiling method continues to update the graph, edge weights in particular, to distinguish trustworthy oracles. Clearly. this discourages the provision of false and inaccurate data. We have conducted an evaluation study to see the effectiveness of our proposed method, in which we have run the experiments utilizing the Ethereum network. Additionally, we have also calculated the cost of running these experiments. Consequently, our experiment results show that the proposed method achieves around 93% accuracy in identifying the trustworthiness of data sources. Author},

	abstract = {With countless devices connected to the Internet of Things, trust mechanisms are especially important. IoT devices are more deeply embedded in the privacy of people’s lives, and their security issues cannot be ignored. Smart contracts backed by blockchain technology have the potential to solve these problems. Therefore, the security of smart contracts cannot be ignored. We propose a flexible and systematic hybrid model, which we call the Serial-Parallel Convolutional Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Network Model incorporating Ensemble Classifiers (SPCBIG-EC). The model showed excellent performance benefits in smart contract vulnerability detection. In addition, we propose a serial-parallel convolution (SPCNN) suitable for our hybrid model. It can extract features from the input sequence for multivariate combinations while retaining temporal structure and location information. The Ensemble Classifier is used in the classification phase of the model to enhance its robustness. In addition, we focused on six typical smart contract vulnerabilities and constructed two datasets, CESC and UCESC, for multi-task vulnerability detection in our experiments. Numerous experiments showed that SPCBIG-EC is better than most existing methods. It is worth mentioning that SPCBIG-EC can achieve F1-scores of 96.74%, 91.62%, and 95.00% for reentrancy, timestamp dependency, and infinite loop vulnerability detection. © 2022, MDPI.

	abstract = {As a temporary facility, scaffolding has an essential role in providing a work environment at height in the construction industry. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), approximately 65% of laborers work on scaffolding. Scaffolding work information needs to be effectively managed with reliability to provide a safe environment. However, managing information of the scaffolding work process remains challenging in forgery risk and manual verification. Blockchain has been widely introduced as an accountable and efficient information management solution. This study presents a blockchain-based system for scaffolding work to grant reliability and efficiency of information management. The system is developed to secure applicability by considering three aspects: (1) optimal blockchain platform regarding characteristics of scaffolding work; (2) storage method to address the hindrance of blockchain; (3) information needed to be compared for verifying adequacy. The detailed configuration and process model for the system is categorically presented, and validated via a case study. The case study confirmed that the system was able to store the information in the block smoothly, verify the information using the smart contract successfully, and remain the block size constant by using off-chain. The proposed system has the potential of practical applicability and could contribute to mitigate potential safety risks associated with inadequate scaffolding work management. Furthermore, the proposed system development flow can be leveraged as a guideline to extend blockchain applications to diverse areas in the construction domain.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {K-anonymity has been gaining widespread attention as one of the most widely used technologies to protect location privacy. Nevertheless, there are still some threats such as behavior deception and service swing, since utilizing distributed k-anonymity technology to construct an anonymous domain. More specifically, the coordinate of the honest node will be a leak if the malicious nodes submit wrong locations coordinate to take part in the domain construction process. Worse still, owing to service swing, the attacker increases the reputation illegally to deceive honest nodes again. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a trusted de-swinging k-anonymity scheme for location privacy protection. Primarily, we introduce a de-swinging reputation evaluation method (DREM), which designs a penalty factor to curb swinging behavior. This method calculates the reputation from entity honesty degree, location information entropy, and service swing degree. Besides, based on our proposed DREM, a credible cloaking area is constructed to protect the location privacy of the requester. In the area, nodes can choose some nodes with a high reputation for completing the construction process of the anonymous domain. Finally, we design reputation contracts to calculate credit automatically based on smart contracts. The security analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme effectively resists malicious attacks, curbs the service swing, and encourages nodes to participate honestly in the construction of cloaking areas. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Due to the characteristics of the blockchain, we may still encounter severe privacy issues, since the data stored on the blockchain are exposed to the public. The proposed scheme provides a general solution for resolving the above-mentioned privacy issue; that is, we try to protect the on-chain privacy of the sensitive data by using homomorphic encryption techniques. Specifically, we constructed a secure comparison protocol that can check the correctness of a logic function directly in the encrypted domain. By using the proposed access control contract and the secure comparison protocol, one can carry out sensitive data-dependent smart contract operations without revealing the data themselves. © 2020 by the authors.

This way, users are not required to share their training data with other parties, maintaining user privacy; however, the vanilla federated learning proposal is mainly assumed to be run in a trusted environment, while the actual implementation of federated learning is expected to be performed in untrusted domains. This paper aims to use blockchain as a trusted federated learning platform to realize the missing “running on untrusted domain” requirement. First, we investigate vanilla federate learning issues such as client’s low motivation, client dropouts, model poisoning, model stealing, and unauthorized access. From those issues, we design building block solutions such as incentive mechanism, reputation system, peer-reviewed model, commitment hash, and model encryption. We then construct the full-fledged blockchain-based federated learning protocol, including client registration, training, aggregation, and reward distribution. Our evaluations show that the proposed solutions made federated learning more reliable. Moreover, the proposed system can motivate participants to be honest and perform best-effort training to obtain higher rewards while punishing malicious behaviors. Hence, running federated learning in an untrusted environment becomes possible. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

So far, most existing solutions focus on an honest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. A few recent works have attempted to construct verifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on specific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general verification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes. In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the potential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain environments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and efficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of SSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to search keywords in shared documents. We implement prototypes of our two designs and present experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of our decentralized SSE schemes.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sealed-bid auctions are a common way of allocating an asset among a set of parties but require trusting an auctioneer who analyses the bids and determines the winner. Many privacy-preserving computation protocols for auctions have been proposed to eliminate the need for a trusted third party. However, they lack fairness, meaning that the adversary learns the outcome of the auction before honest parties and may choose to make the protocol fail without suffering any consequences. In this work, we propose efficient protocols for both first and second-price sealed-bid auctions with fairness against rational adversaries, leveraging secret cryptocurrency transactions and public smart contracts. In our approach, the bidders jointly compute the winner of the auction while preserving the privacy of losing bids and ensuring that cheaters are financially punished by losing a secret collateral deposit. We guarantee that it is never profitable for rational adversaries to cheat by making the deposit equal to the bid plus the cost of running the protocol, i.e., once a party commits to a bid, it is guaranteed that it has the funds and it cannot walk away from the protocol without forfeiting the bid. Moreover, our protocols ensure that the winner is determined and the auction payments are completed even if the adversary misbehaves so that it cannot force the protocol to fail and then rejoin the auction with an adjusted bid. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, our constructions are both more efficient and furthermore achieve stronger security properties, i.e., fairness. Interestingly, we show how the second-price can be computed with a minimal increase of the complexity of the simpler first-price case. Moreover, in case there is no cheating, only collateral deposit and refund transactions must be sent to the smart contract, significantly saving on-chain storage. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {A supply chain consists of many stakeholders such as suppliers, carriers and customers. It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a 'one trusted ledger' that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our findings, one potential impact of deploying blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain can obtain verified information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research, we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conflict of interests. Future work such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying this technology within a supply chain. Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The advance of information technology has a growing influence on one of the most popular social trends: online shopping. The rising popularity of online shopping among the general public, as indicated by the growth in the number of online purchasers each year, has prompted business owners to pursue online ventures. The marketplace is intrinsically tied to online buying activity that connects merchants and customers, allowing customers to search for various goods and services from various providers. However, service failures are vulnerable to centralized market systems that emerge frequently. When the company's services to customers fail to satisfy consumer expectations. A breakdown in purchasing and selling essential services, including product delivery and customer support, is referred to as service failure. As a result, not only does this harm confidence, but it may also cause clients to migrate to an alternative marketplace. The marketplace's competitiveness is based on consumer confidence. The decentralized marketplace can address this security concern. A decentralized marketplace is meant to build a system that does not require the confidence of a third party using blockchain technology and smart contracts that can record all transactions clearly and consistently, allowing them to serve as a single point of truth between distrusting entities. The findings largely support the feasibility of Ethereum Smart Contracts to construct a decentralized marketplace. However, there are some places where further study and development are needed. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In the collaborative business environment, blockchain coupled with smart contract removes the reliance on a central system and offers data integrity which is crucial when the transacting parties rely on the shared data. The acceptance of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for the continued use of the services. Despite many extensive studies evaluating the performance of blockchain-based systems, few have focused on users’ acceptance of real-life applications. Objective: The main objective of this research is to evaluate the user acceptance of a real-life blockchain-based system (BBS) by observing various latent variables affecting the development of users’ attitudes and intention to use the system. It also aims to uncover the dimensions and role of trust, security and privacy alongside the primary Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-based predictors and their causal relationship with the users’ behavior to adopt such BBS. Methods: We tested the augmented TAM with Trust Model on a BBS that comprises two subsystems: a Shopping Cart System (SCS), a system oriented towards end-users and a Data Sharing System (DSS), a system oriented towards system administrators. We set research questions and hypotheses, and conducted online surveys by requesting each participant to respond to the questionnaire after using the respective system. The main study comprises two separate sub-studies: the first study was performed on SCS and the second on DSS. Furthermore, each study data comprises initial pre-test and post-test data scores. We analyzed the research model with partial least square structural equation modelling. Results: The empirical study validates our research model and supports most of the research hypotheses. Based on our findings, we deduce that TAM-based predictors and trust constructs cannot be applied uniformly to BBS. Depending on the specifics of the BBS, the relationships between perceived trust antecedents and attitudes towards the system might change. For SCS, trust is the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system, while DSS has perceived privacy as the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system. Quality of system shows the strongest total effect on intention to use SCS, while perceived usefulness has the strongest total effect on intention to use DSS. Trust has a positive significant effect on users’ attitudes towards both BSS, while security does not have any significant effect on users’ attitudes toward BBS. In SCS, privacy positively affects trust, but security has no significant effect on trust, whereas, in DSS, both privacy and security have significant effects on trust. In both BBS, trust has a moderating effect on privacy that correlates with attitudes towards BBS, whereas security does not have any mediating role between privacy and attitudes towards BBS. Hence, we recommend that while developing BBS, particular attention should be paid to increasing user trust and perceived privacy. © Copyright 2021 Shrestha et al.},

	abstract = {The revolution of Malaysian Construction 4.0 through emerging technologies has brought a paradigm shift that has digitalized the construction sector. There is a need to adopt a computerized protocol to assist in automating the performance of a contract to meet future digital challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to serve as a pioneer study to investigate the implementation of the Malaysian construction industry to adopt smart contracts. This study adopted a qualitative scientific methodology, whereby a systematic review was conducted to gather the benefits and challenges of implementing smart contracts in the construction industry. Further, interview sessions were arranged to collect data from the construction contract management experts. The research findings unveil that due to the self-executing attribute of smart contracts, the implementation of smart contracts could provide a better apportionment of risks in a contract. The study also finds that the challenges in implementing smart contracts are severe. For instance, the smart contract is irreversible and immutable and prone to human error. The study concludes that it is more suitable to apply and implement a smart contract to a short-term contract that is not subjected to variation. Furthermore, a smart contract can enhance the efficiency in managing the contracts, such as reducing time and managing the conflicts and disputes that arise during the contract duration. The developed implementation framework is significant for the construction personnel, especially those dealing with the contract administration. The implementation of smart contracts in construction could boost contract administration and management discipline via investment in this new technology. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {Due to the simplicity and performance of zk-SNARKs they are widely used in real-world cryptographic protocols, including blockchain and smart contract systems. Simulation Extractability (SE) is a necessary security property for a NIZK argument to achieve Universal Composability (UC), a common requirement for such protocols. Most of the works that investigate SE focus on its strong variant which implies proof non-malleability. In this work we investigate a relaxed weaker notion, that allows proof randomization, while guaranteeing statement non-malleability, which we argue to be a more natural security property. First, we show that it is already achievable by Groth16, arguably the most efficient and widely deployed SNARK nowadays. Second, we show that because of this, Groth16 can be efficiently transformed into a black-box weakly SE NIZK, which is sufficient for UC protocols. To support the second claim, we present and compare two practical constructions, both of which strike different performance tradeoffs: Int-Groth16 makes use of a known transformation that encrypts the witness inside the SNARK circuit. We instantiate this transformation with an efficient SNARK-friendly encryption scheme.Ext-Groth16 is based on the SAVER encryption scheme (Lee et al.) that plugs the encrypted witness directly into the verification equation, externally to the circuit. We prove that Ext-Groth16 is black-box weakly SE and, contrary to Int-Groth16, that its proofs are fully randomizable. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

	abstract = {A smart contract honeypot is a special type of smart contract. This type of contract seems to have obvious vulnerabilities in contract design. If a user transfers a certain amount of funds to the contract, then the user can withdraw the funds in the contract. However, once users try to take advantage of this seemingly obvious vulnerability, they will fall into a real trap. Consequently, the user's investment in the contract cannot be retrieved. The honeypot induces other accounts to launch funds, which seriously threatens the security of property on the blockchain. Detection methods for honeypots are available. However, studying the manner by which to defend existing honeypots is insufficient to fight against honeypots. The new honeypots that may appear in the future from the perspective of an attacker must also be predicted. Therefore, we propose a type of adversarial honeypot. The code and behavioral features of honeypots are obtained through a comparative analysis of the 158,568 non-honeypots and 352 honeypots. To build an adversarial honeypot, we try to separately hide these features and make the honeypot bypass the existing detection technology. We construct 18 instances on the basis of the proposed adversarial honeypot and use an open-source honeypot detection tool to detect these instances. The experimental result shows that the proposed honeypot can bypass the detection tool with a 100% ratio. Therefore, this type of honeypot should be given attention, and defensive measures should be proposed as soon as possible. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Physical layer security (PLS) is considered as a promising technique to prevent information eavesdropping in wireless systems. In this context, cooperative relaying has emerged as a robust solution for achieving PLS due to multipath diversity and relatively lower transmission power. However, relays or the relay operators in the practical environment are unwilling for service provisioning unless they are incentivized for their cost of services. Thus, it is required to jointly consider network economics and relay cooperation to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint network economics and PLS using cooperative relaying and jamming. Based on the double auction theory, we model the interaction between transmitters seeking for a particular level of secure transmission of information and relay operators for suitable relay and jammer assignment, in a multiple source-destination networks. In addition, theoretical analyses are presented to justify that the proposed auction mechanism satisfies the desirable economic properties of individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. As the participants in the traditional centralized auction framework may take selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a decentralized and trustless auction framework based on blockchain technology. In particular, we exploit the smart contract feature of blockchain to construct a completely autonomous framework, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. The security properties of the proposed framework are also discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As the most successful application of the sharing economy, ride-hailing service is popular worldwide and serves millions of users per day worldwide. Ride-hailing service providers (SPs) usually collect users' personal data to improve their services via big data technologies. However, SPs may also use the collected user data to apply personalized prices to different users, which raises price fairness concerns. In this paper, we propose a smart price auditing system named Spas. Spas allows a user to purchase Fair Price Insurance in the form of Price Auditing Contract, then the price of ride-hailing service (RHS) order will be audited automatically once completed. According to the auditing result, the contract punishes misbehaving SPs and also compensates affected users automatically. By replacing an untrustworthy centralized auditor with carefully designed smart contracts, we construct a decentralized price auditing system which is trustworthy and transparent. We demonstrate a theoretical model for practical payment flows based on real RHS user data and we implement Spas in Hyperledger Fabric to show that decentralizing and automating price auditing for RHS with financial incentives is technically feasible. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled ‘cyber defense.’ The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense.

	abstract = {Scaling the transaction throughput of decentralized blockchain ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has been an ongoing challenge. Two-party duplex payment channels have been designed and used as building blocks to construct linked payment networks, which allow atomic and trust-free payments between parties without exhausting the resources of the blockchain. Once a payment channel, however, is depleted (e.g., because transactions were mostly unidirectional) the channel would need to be closed and re-funded to allow for new transactions. Users are envisioned to entertain multiple payment channels with different entities, and as such, instead of refunding a channel (which incurs costly on-chain transactions), a user should be able to leverage his existing channels to rebalance a poorly funded channel. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first solution that allows an arbitrary set of users in a payment channel network to securely rebalance their channels, according to the preferences of the channel owners. Except in the case of disputes (similar to conventional payment channels), our solution does not require onchain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing blockchains. In our security analysis, we show that an honest participant cannot lose any of its funds while rebalancing. We finally provide a proof of concept implementation and evaluation for the Ethereum network. © 2017 author(s).},

	abstract = {With the rapidly developing of Internet of Things (IoT), the volume of data generated by IoT systems is increasing quickly. To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

In this article, we propose a plastic credit driven system consisting of a recyclability index (RI) and plastic credit to impel plastic recycling and increase the quality of recyclable plastics through a market self-regulation mechanism. The RI is designed to evaluate the recyclability value of different plastic products based on their material compositions. The plastic credit, defined by the quantitative relation between the RI and product information, can be issued or traded by system stakeholders. Instead of setting rigid industry standards to regulate plastic quality, we construct a governance community among industry participants using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to self-regulate and monitor plastic production and trading. The proposed system is constructed on a consortium blockchain and a public blockchain to negotiate the RI, issue credits, and trade credits using smart contracts. Through the overall system performance analysis, the experimental results demonstrate that the designed plastic credit system can promote a demand shift toward plastic products with higher plastic recyclability and achieve a lightweight operation for resource requirements and system maintenance.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

The safety, audit, responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of building information, responsibility traceability and customer satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the aspects of design technology, construction management, material scheduling and whole life cycle construction. This paper will provide some new ideas for the whole life cycle collaborative management of digital construction.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based voting, including liquid voting, has been extensively studied in recent years. However, it remains challenging to implement liquid voting on blockchain using Ethereum smart contract. The challenge comes from the gas limit, which is that the number of instructions for processing a ballot cannot exceed a certain amount. This restricts the application scenario with respect to algorithms whose time complexity is linear to the number of voters, i.e., O(n). As the blockchain technology can well share and reuse the resources, we study a model of liquid voting on blockchain and propose a fast algorithm, named Flash, to eliminate the restriction. The key idea behind our algorithm is to shift some on-chain process to off-chain. In detail, we first construct a Merkle tree off-chain which contains all voters' properties. Second, we use Merkle proof and interval tree to process each ballot with O(log n) on-chain time complexity. Theoretically, the algorithm can support up to 21000 voters with respect to the current gas limit on Ethereum. Experimentally, the result implies that the consumed gas fee remains at a very low level when the number of voters increases. This means our algorithm makes liquid voting on blockchain practical even for massive voters. © 2021 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers},

Various solutions used to build the smart-city network demand a scalable and decentralized solution. This study proposes a blockchain-empowered decentralized and scalable solution for a sustainable smart-city network. The Internet of Things (IoT), fog nodes, permissioned trust chain, smart contract, blockchain, and InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) are deployed to construct a scalable and decentralized solution for a sustainable smart city. Three main public sector departments, i.e., electricity, water supply, and health care, are studied over the proposed solution. The proposed solution is implemented over constrained application protocol (CoAP) and Ethereum blockchain. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for 1500 devices and over 10,000 records. A total 77.44% improvement is registered during performance evaluation over a scalable environment. The performance evaluation of each case study and collaborative performance evaluation concludes the improvised performance of the proposed solution for scalable and distributed applications. Better performance, scalability, and the distributed nature of the presented model make it suitable for the sustainable smart-city network. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Recently, security issues of smart contracts are arising great attention due to the enormous financial loss caused by vulnerability attacks. There is an increasing need to detect similar codes for hunting vulnerability with the increase of critical security issues in smart contracts. Binary similarity detection that quantitatively measures the given code diffing has been widely adopted to facilitate critical security analysis. However, due to the difference between common programs and smart contract, such as diversity of bytecode generation and highly code homogeneity, directly adopting existing graph matching and machine learning based techniques to smart contracts suffers from low accuracy, poor scalability and the limitation of binary similarity on function level. Therefore, this paper investigates graph neural network to detect smart contract binary code similarity at the program level, where we conduct instruction-level normalization to reduce the noise code for smart contract pre-processing and construct contract control flow graphs to represent smart contracts. In particular, two improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models are explored to encode the contract graphs into quantitatively vectors, which can capture the semantic information and the program-wide control flow information with temporal orders. Then we can efficiently accomplish the similarity detection by measuring the distance between two targeted contract embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficient of our proposed method, extensive experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, i.e., smart contracts from Ethereum and Enterprise Operation System (EOS) blockchain-based platforms. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving a great improvement up to 6.1% and 17.06% in accuracy. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {With the popularity of cryptocurrencies and the remarkable development of blockchain technology, decentralized applications emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Meanwhile, decentralized applications have also attracted intense attention from the online gambling community, with more and more decentralized gambling platforms created through the help of smart contracts. Compared with conventional gambling platforms, decentralized gambling has transparent rules and a low participation threshold, attracting a substantial number of gamblers. In order to discover gambling behaviors and identify the contracts and addresses involved in gambling, we propose a tool termed ETHGamDet. The tool is able to automatically detect the smart contracts and addresses involved in gambling by scrutinizing the smart contract code and address transaction records. Interestingly, we present a novel LightGBM model with memory components, which possesses the ability to learn from its own misclassifications. As a side contribution, we construct and release a large-scale gambling dataset at https://github.com/AwesomeHuang/Bitcoin-Gambling-Dataset to facilitate future research in this field. Empirically, ETHGamDet achieves a F1-score of 0.72 and 0.89 in address classification and contract classification respectively, and offers novel and interesting insights. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Several popular blockchains such as Ethereum execute complex transactions through user-defined scripts. A block of the chain typically consists of multiple smart contract transactions (SCTs). To append a block into the blockchain, a miner executes these SCTs. On receiving this block, other nodes act as validators, who re-execute these SCTs as part of the consensus protocol to validate the block. In Ethereum and other blockchains that support cryptocurrencies, a miner gets an incentive every time such a valid block is successfully added to the blockchain. When executing SCTs sequentially, miners and validators fail to harness the power of multiprocessing offered by the prevalence of multi-core processors, thus degrading throughput. By leveraging multiple threads to execute SCTs, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. Recently, Read-Write Software Transactional Memory Systems (RWSTMs) were used for concurrent execution of SCTs. It is known that Object-based STMs (OSTMs), using higher-level objects (such as hash-tables or lists), achieve better throughput as compared to RWSTMs. Even greater concurrency can be obtained using Multi-Version OSTMs (MVOSTMs), which maintain multiple versions for each shared data item as opposed to Single-Version OSTMs (SVOSTMs). This paper proposes an efficient framework to execute SCTs concurrently based on object semantics, using optimistic SVOSTMs and MVOSTMs. In our framework, a multi-threaded miner constructs a Block Graph (BG), capturing the object-conflicts relations between SCTs, and stores it in the block. Later, validators re-execute the same SCTs concurrently and deterministically relying on this BG. A malicious miner can modify the BG to harm the blockchain, e.g., to cause double spending. To identify malicious miners, we propose Smart Multi-threaded Validator (SMV). Experimental analysis shows that proposed multi-threaded miner and validator achieve significant performance gains over state-of-the-art SCT execution framework. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, the disparity in living standards incites the minds of certain undesirable members of society to commit crimes, which may disrupt society’s stability and mental calm. Breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) make it feasible to address such challenges and construct a complete intelligent framework that automatically detects such malicious behaviors. Motivated by this, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Xception model, i.e., BlockCrime, to detect crimes and improve public safety. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to securely store the detected crime scene locations and alert the nearest law enforcement authorities. Due to the scarcity of the dataset, transfer learning has been preferred, in which a CNN-based Xception model is used.

The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from being targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises.

This new application scenario also faces data security threats, even more complex. When a user quit its group, remaining data block signatures must be re-signed to ensure security. Some researchers noticed this problem and proposed a few works to relieve computing overhead on user side. However, considering the privacy and security need of group auditing, there still lacks a comprehensive solution to implement secure group user revocation, supporting identity privacy preserving and collusion attack resistance. Aiming at this target, we construct a concrete scheme based on ring signature and smart contracts. We introduce linkable ring signature to build a kind of novel meta data for integrity proof enabling anonymous verification. And the new meta data supports secure revocation. Meanwhile, smart contracts are using for resisting possible collusion attack and malicious re-signing computation. Under the combined effectiveness of both signature method and blockchain smart contracts, our proposal supports reliable user revocation and signature re-signing, without revealing any user identity in the whole process. Security and performance analysis compared with previous works prove that the proposed scheme is feasible and efficient. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

Government legislation, novel types of payment agreements, conventional information technology solutions, and supply chain management best practices have endeavoured to solve payment-related financial issues in the construction industry, which are mainly caused by the complexities of the construction supply chain. Nevertheless, payment-related issues persist as one of the key challenges in the industry. Applications of blockchain technology-a trusted, distributed data storing mechanism-along with smart contracts are gaining focus as solutions for complex interorganisational processes. A smart contract is a self-executing script that codifies a set of rules or agreements between multiple parties and runs across the blockchain network. This paper identifies the suitability of blockchain and smart contract technologies in solving payment issues in the construction industry. An expert forum of construction industry stakeholders served as the primary data collection method through a structured questionnaire. The key finding of the paper is that blockchain and smart contract powered solutions can significantly mitigate the payment and related financial issues in the construction industry, including partial payments, nonpayments, cost of finance, long payment cycle, retention, and security of payments. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are one of the main building blocks for securing communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the control of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by numerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault tolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart contract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of PKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity systems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even constant) sized amount of data for verifying identity records stored off chain. However, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little information regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs. In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart contract based PKI of Patsonakis et al. on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs constant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore this tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates the need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of Patsonakis et al. and, as illustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized state that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we compare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g., the Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart contract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost model. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would be useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so that it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used because of its high efficiency and real-time collaboration. A wireless sensor network is the core technology to support the operation of the IoT, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Aiming at the problem that the existing malicious node detection methods in wireless sensor networks cannot be guaranteed by fairness and traceability of detection process, we present a blockchain trust model (BTM) for malicious node detection in wireless sensor networks. First, it gives the whole framework of the trust model. Then, it constructs the blockchain data structure which is used to detect malicious nodes. Finally, it realizes the detection of malicious nodes in 3D space by using the blockchain smart contract and the WSNs' quadrilateral measurement localization method, and the voting consensus results are recorded in the blockchain distributed. The simulation results show that the model can effectively detect malicious nodes in WSNs, and it can also ensure the traceability of the detection process. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Solidity is a widely used scripting language for developing smart contracts in blockchain applications. Quality assurance of Solidity contracts is of critical importance because bugs can lead to considerable loss of assets. As software testing is a common practice for quality assurance, many Solidity projects have included built-in tests. It is unclear, however, what level of quality assurance these built-in tests can achieve. This paper presents Deviant, a mutation testing tool for Solidity smart contracts. It automatically generates mutants of a given Solidity project and runs all mutants against the given tests to evaluate their effectiveness. To simulate various faults in Solidity smart contracts, Deviant provides mutation operators for all the unique features of Solidity according to the Solidity fault taxonomy, in addition to the traditional programming constructs. We have used Deviant to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests for three Solidity projects. The results indicate that these tests have not yet achieved high mutation scores and that a test suite adequate for the statement and branch coverage criteria of Solidity smart contracts does not necessarily provide a high-level assurance of code quality. Such observations offer important guidelines for Solidity developers to implement more effective tests in order to deliver trustworthy code and reduce the risk of financial loss. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Data assets trading can encourage owners to distribute data and achieve large-scale data aggregation to promote the development of the supply chain system. Blockchain is a promising platform for constructing a decentralized data marketplace. The data may face risks in the marketplace, such as illegal theft, malicious tampering, or illegal distribution in the transactions process. The data ownership confirmation in a blockchain-empowered marketplace has attracted much attention in recent years. However, challenges still remain, including maintaining data integrity, traceability of illegal data, and accountability. In this paper, we propose a new data ownership confirmation scheme (DOCS) in the transaction scenario of blockchain-empowered distributed data assets trading. It integrates smart contracts, data-embedding technology, and data fingerprint to realize ownership confirmation and protection of data assets in transactions. DOCS ensures reliable mapping between on-chain data ownership information and off-chain data entities, which assists with the accurate prosecution of the illegal distribution of data assets. We demonstrate that DOCS can have desirable security properties in multiple attack models. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Data owners outsource their data to remote storage providers without keeping local replicas to save their precious storage resources. However, the ownership and management of data are separated after outsourcing. How to ensure the integrity and recoverability of outsourced data becomes a significant problem. Provable Data Possession (PDP) and Proofs of Retrievability (POR) are two cryptographic protocols that enable users to verify the integrity of outsourced data. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art PDP and POR schemes either need users to perform the complicated audit tasks by themselves or delegate these tasks to a Third-Party Auditor (TPA). Moreover, these schemes are constructed on a centralized storage framework which vulnerably suffers single-point-of-failure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized self-auditing scheme with batch verification. Firstly, data owners outsource their data to decentralized storage nodes, which can achieve self-auditing based on blockchain without TPA. Secondly, our scheme uses Pedersen-based polynomial commitment to significantly reduce the number of authenticators. Furthermore, we propose a batch verification algorithm, which can verify multiple proofs from different storage nodes to improve the verification efficiency. Finally, we analyze the security of our scheme and implement a gas-efficient system prototype using the smart contracts of the Ethereum Reposten test network. The results demonstrate that the scheme is practical. © 2022 Zhonghao Yuan et al.},

	abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties involved, which often leads to “adversarial relationships”, “risk avoidance”, and a “lack of trust” among the different actors. This culture is further compounded by a “linear workflow” that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The deployment of small-scale renewable energy sources will transform the management of energy grids towards more decentralized solutions in which the prosumers will have a more active role. Regulatory and market barriers are driving the implementation of virtual aggregation models in which the small-scale prosumers work together on a larger scale to gain benefits that could not be obtained on an individual basis. In this paper, we propose to use public blockchain and self-enforcing smart contracts to construct Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) of prosumers to provide energy services. A model has been defined for capturing the prosumer level constraints in terms of available energy profiles and energy service requirements enabling their optimal aggregation in hierarchical structures. A lightweight decentralized solution for VPPs construction is implemented using smart contracts enabling its efficient running on the public blockchain. Smart contracts are encoding the model constraints and are defining functionalities for prosumers to initiate or join a VPP implementing the complete chain of Offer-Operate-Measure-Remunerate actions. The VPP will be managed on top of a distributed ledger technology offering decentralized functionality for tracking and validating the delivery of energy based on the blockchain transactions and for energy and financial settlement, the remuneration being done according to the amount of energy provided by individual prosumers. Experimental results show that the proposed solution runs successfully on the public blockchain with good execution time and can address Balancing Responsible Party requests for additional generation. The overhead in terms of gas consumption and transactional throughput stays within reasonable boundaries.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The widespread recognition of the smart contracts has established their importance in the landscape of next generation blockchain technology. However, writing a correct smart contract is notoriously difficult. Moreover, once a state-changing transaction is confirmed by the network, the result is immutable. For this reason, it is crucial to perform a thorough testing of a smart contract application before its deployment. This paper's focus is on the test coverage criteria for smart contracts, which are objective rules that measure test quality. We analyze the unique characteristics of the Ethereum smart contract program model as compared to the conventional program model. To capture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the notions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction interaction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent inter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum transactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the permutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two notions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms are given to the generation of coverage requirements. A case study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed test coverage criteria with random testing and statement coverage testing. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts running on public blockchains are permissionless and decentralized, attracting both developers and malicious participants. Ethereum, the world’s largest decentralized application platform on which more than 40 million smart contracts are running, is frequently challenged by smart contract vulnerabilities. What’s worse, since the homogeneity of a wide range of smart contracts and the increase in inter-contract dependencies, a vulnerability in a certain smart contract could affect a large number of other contracts in Ethereum. However, little is known about how vulnerable contracts affect other on-chain contracts and which contracts can be affected. Thus, we first present the contract dependency graph (CDG) to perform a vulnerability analysis for Ethereum smart contracts, where CDG characterizes inter-contract dependencies formed by DELEGATECALL-type internal transaction in Ethereum. Then, three generic definitions of security violations against CDG are given for finding respective potential victim contracts affected by different types of vulnerable contracts. Further, we construct the CDG with 195,247 smart contracts active in the latest blocks of the Ethereum and verify the above security violations against CDG by detecting three representative known vulnerabilities. Compared to previous large-scale vulnerability analysis, our analysis scheme marks potential victim contracts that can be affected by different types of vulnerable contracts, and identify their possible risks based on the type of security violation actually occurring. The analysis results show that the proportion of potential victim contracts reaches 14.7%, far more than that of corresponding vulnerable contracts (less than 0.02%) in CDG. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network. IEEE},

	abstract = {Motivated by the immutable nature of Ethereum smart contracts and of their transactions, quite many approaches have been proposed to detect defects and security problems before smart contracts become persistent in the blockchain and they are granted control on substantial financial value.Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode, that is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated tools.This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches.Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multiple-operators (multi-OPs) spectrum sharing mechanism can effectively improve the spectrum utilization in fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks. The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a permissioned blockchain trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless communication networks in this paper. The Multi-OPs Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart contract is designed on the constructed permissioned blockchain to implement the spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs. The MOSS smart contract is tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE) and the gas costs of MOSS smart contract is estimated. The performance analysis of the proposed permissioned blockchain trust framework demonstrates that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better than traditional spectrum allocation solutions. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen smart contracts are getting increasingly popular in building trustworthy decentralized applications. Previous research has proposed static and dynamic techniques to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. These tools check vulnerable contracts against several predefined rules. However, the emerging new vulnerable types and programming skills to prevent possible vulnerabilities emerging lead to a large number of false positive and false negative reports of tools. To address this, we propose VULPEDIA, which mines expressive vulnerability signatures from contracts. VULPEDIA is based on the relaxed assumption that the owner of contract is not malicious. Specifically, we extract structural program features from vulnerable and benign contracts as vulnerability signatures, and construct a systematic detection method based on detection rules composed of vulnerability signatures. Compared with the rules defined by state-of-the-arts, our approach can extract more expressive rules to achieve better completeness (i.e., detection recall) and soundness (i.e., precision). We further evaluate VULPEDIA with four baselines (i.e., Slither, Securify, SmartCheck and Oyente) on the testing dataset consisting of 17,770 contracts. The experiment results show that VULPEDIA achieves best performance of precision on 4 types of vulnerabilities and leading recall on 3 types of vulnerabilities meanwhile exhibiting the great efficiency performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

However, despite very advanced functionalities and specific use cases, existing solutions share the natural limitation that the number of usages of these signing rights cannot be efficiently limited, but users can at most be disincentivized to abuse their rights. In this paper, we suggest a solution to this problem based on blockchains. We let a user define a smart contract defining delegated signing rights, which needs to be triggered to successfully sign a message. By leveraging the immutability of the blockchain, our construction can now guarantee that a user-defined threshold of signature invocations cannot be exceeded, thereby circumventing the need for dedicated hardware or similar assistance in existing constructions for one-time programs. We discuss different constructions supporting different features, and provide concrete implementations in the Solidity language of the Ethereum blockchain, proving the real-world efficiency and feasibility of our construction. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to automate the generation of traceable and protected documentation of complex assembly processes. The final assembly in aviation, automotive, and appliances industries is a rigorous process that has limited capabilities of full traceability associated with: (1) the parts installed, (2) their fabrication processes, and (3) the assembly work. This is also the case for each of its sub-assemblies. The thousands of parts forming a hierarchy of sub-assemblies that are dynamically accumulated to compose the final assembly make full traceability a challenging feat that is almost unsurmountable. Such full traceability along the entire supply chain requires considerable cost and effort since it must be based on documentation of most assembled parts, assembly tasks, and inspection tasks that compose the full assembled product. In addition, security measures are needed to prevent hostile hacking and unauthorized approach to the assembly documentation throughout the entire supply chain. The related documentation and repeated verifications require considerable effort and have many chances for human errors. So, automating these processes has great value. This article expounds a framework that harnesses blockchain and smart-contract technology to offer automated traceable and protected documentation of the assembly process. For this purpose, we expand the concept of a Bill-Of-Assembly (BOA) to incorporate data from the bill of materials (BOM), the associated assembly activities, the associated activities’ specification parameters and materials, and the associated assembly resources (machines and/or operators). The paper defines the operation of the BOA with blockchain and smart-contract technology, for attaining full traceability, safety, and security, for the entire assembled product. Future research could extend the proposed approach to facilitate the usage of the BOA data structure in constructing a digital twin of the entire simulated system. © 2023 by the authors.},

The initial adoption of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for continued use of the services, but their user acceptance behavioral model has not been well investigated in the literature. In this paper, we take the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a foundation and extend the external constructs to uncover how the perceived ease of use, perceived usability, quality of the system and perceived enjoyment influence the intention to use the blockchain-based system. We based our study on user evaluation of a prototype of a blockchain-based research data sharing framework using a TAM validated questionnaire. Our results show that, overall, all the individual constructs of the behavior model significantly influence the intention to use the system while their collective effect is found to be insignificant. The quality of the system and the perceived enjoyment have stronger influence on the perceived usefulness. However, the effect of perceived ease of use on the perceived usefulness is not supported. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The key issue in the field of smart contract security is efficient and rapid vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Most of the existing detection methods can only detect the presence of vulnerabilities in the contract and can hardly identify their type. Furthermore, they have poor scalability. To resolve these issues, in this study, we developed a smart contract vulnerability detection model based on multi‐task learning. By setting auxiliary tasks to learn more directional vulnerability features, the detection capability of the model was improved to realize the detection and recognition of vulnerabilities. The model is based on a hard‐sharing design, which consists of two parts. First, the bottom sharing layer is mainly used to learn the semantic information of the input contract. The text representation is first transformed into a new vector by word and positional embedding, and then the neural network, based on an attention mechanism, is used to learn and extract the feature vector of the contract. Second, the task‐specific layer is mainly employed to realize the functions of each task. A classical convolutional neural network was used to construct a classification model for each task that learns and extracts features from the shared layer for training to achieve their respective task objectives. The experimental results show that the model can better identify the types of vulnerabilities after adding the auxiliary vulnerability detection task. This model realizes the detection of vulnerabilities and recognizes three types of vulnerabilities. The multi‐task model was observed to perform better and is less expensive than a single‐task model in terms of time, computation, and storage. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we present the mechanisms we designed to create secure and machine-verifiable academic credentials. Our protocol models a diploma as an evolving set of immutable credentials. The credentials are built as a tree-based data structure with linked time-stamping, where portions of credentials are distributed over a set of smart contracts. Our design prevents fraud of diplomas and eases the detection of degree mills, while increasing the transparency and trust in the issuer’s procedures. Our evaluation shows that our solution offers a certification system with strong cryptographic security and imposes a high level of transparency of the certification process.

Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, any bugs or errors will become permanent once published and could lead to huge economic losses. Recently, a great number of security problems have been exposed in smart contracts. It is important to verify the correctness of smart contracts before they are deployed on the blockchain. This paper aims to verify the correctness of smart contracts in Ethereum transactions, and the model checker Spin is adopted for the formal verification of smart contracts in order to ensure their execution with respect to parties’ willingness, as well as their reliable interaction with clients. In this direction, we propose a formal method to construct the models for smart contracts. Then, the method is applied to a study case in the Ethereum commodity market. Finally, a case model is implemented in Spin, which can simulate the process’s execution and verify the properties that are abstracted from the requirements. Compared with existing techniques, formal analysis can verify whether smart contracts comply with the specifications for given behaviors and strengthen the credibility of smart contracts in the transaction. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study explores blockchain acceptance by mining the collective intelligence of users on Twitter. It maps blockchain user acceptance drivers to technology acceptance constructs. The analysis shows that users are attracted by security, privacy, transparency, trust and traceability aspects provided by blockchain. On Twitter more discussions on blockchain benefits than on drawbacks. Initial coin offering (ICO) is extensively discussed.

	abstract = {Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies have been applied in many areas, from economics, the internet of things to the industrial internet. In order to solve the issue that the Hyperledger Fabric does not currently support Chinese Commercial Cryptographic (CCC) algorithms, we extended the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP) module in the Hyperledger Fabric by upgrading the original BCCSP module to support the CCC algorithms SM2 and SM3. Furthermore, we designed a transaction process by using UBCCSP (Upgraded BCCSP), and a new smart contract also has been presented. After that, an improved consortium blockchain information system based on UBCCSP named UCBIS (Consortium Blockchain Information System based on UBCCSP) is proposed. In the Hyperledger Fabric transaction process, the identity information and transaction data are protected by the SM2 and SM3 algorithms, moreover, SM3 is also used in the construction process of smart contracts. Our smart contracts reduce the total data amount and improve query efficiency. Finally, the information query system based on UBCCSP is implemented. After being tested and analyzed, the average time for every query is only 31.162 ms in the blockchain system, which has better performance and higher query efficiency. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Network slicing is one of the fundamental tenets of Fifth Generation (5G)/Sixth Generation (6G) networks. Deploying slices requires end-to-end (E2E) control of services and the underlying resources in a network substrate featuring an increasing number of stakeholders. Beyond the technical difficulties this entails, there is a long list of administrative negotiations among parties that do not necessarily trust each other, which often requires costly manual processes, including the legal construction of neutral entities. In this context, Blockchain comes to the rescue by bringing its decentralized yet immutable and auditable lemdger, which has a high potential in the telco arena. In this sense, it may help to automate some of the above costly processes. There have been some proposals in this direction that are applied to various problems among different stakeholders. This paper aims at structuring this field of knowledge by, first, providing introductions to network slicing and blockchain technologies. Then, state-of-the-art is presented through a global architecture that aggregates the various proposals into a coherent whole while showing the motivation behind applying Blockchain and smart contracts to network slicing. And finally, some limitations of current work, future challenges and research directions are also presented. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) technology is capable of achieving accurate ciphertext retrieval while protecting data privacy. However, curious or malicious semi-trusted cloud servers can cause privacy breaches, which then creates a trust problem for ciphertext management and searching. To address this problem, we propose a trusted certificateless authentication public-key encryption with a keyword search scheme in cloud storage (TCA-PEKS), which ensuring trusted retrieval, simultaneously resolves the problems of key escrow and certificate management that exist in PEKS. In the scheme, the security of the ciphertext storage and verifications are strengthened based on blockchain non-tampering features, which assists users in verifying the correctness of a file. In particular, we construct an open and transparent smart contract to limit the malicious behaviour of cloud servers, in which the user’s complete private key splits the secret value and the partial private key, further guaranteeing the correctness of the retrieval process. Finally, the scheme is proven to satisfy ciphertext and trapdoor indistinguishability under the random oracle model, and the performance evaluation results show that the scheme is highly efficient. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Logging system activities are required to provide credibility and confidence in the systems used by an organization. Logs in computer systems must be secured from the root user so that they are true and fair. This paper introduces RootLogChain, a blockchain-based audit mechanism that is built upon a security protocol to create both a root user in a blockchain network and the first log; from there, all root events are stored as logs within a standard blockchain mechanism. RootLogChain provides security constructs so as to be deployed in a distributed context over a hostile environment, such as the internet. We have developed a prototype based on a microservice architecture, validating it by executing different stress proofs in two scenarios: one with compliant agents and the other without. In such scenarios, several compliant and non-compliant agents try to become a root and register the events within the blockchain. Non-compliant agents simulate eavesdropper entities that do not follow the rules of the protocol. Our experiments show that the mechanism guarantees the creation of one and only one root user, integrity, and authenticity of the transactions; it also stores all events generated by the root within a blockchain. In addition, for audit issues, the traceability of the transaction logs can be consulted by the root. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and other forms of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provide an opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We propose a redactable blockchain trust scheme based on reputation consensus and a one-way trapdoor function in response to the problem that data on the blockchain, which is an error or invalid needs to be modified or deleted. The scheme calculates each user's reputation based on their currency age and behavior. The SM2 asymmetric cryptography algorithm is used as the one-way trapdoor function to construct a new Merkle tree structure, which guarantees the legitimacy of the modification or deletion after verification and vote. The simulation experiments show that the modification or deletion does not change the existing blockchain structure and the links of blocks. Furthermore, the consensus verification accurately passes after the modification or deletion operations, which indicates the proposed scheme is feasible.  © 2022 YongLi Tang et al.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts constitute the foundation for blockchain distributed applications. These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Efficient and reliable access control in smart cities is critical for the protection of various resources for decision making and task execution. Existing centralized access control schemes suffer from the limitations of single point of failure, low reliability, and poor scalability. This article, therefore, proposes a distributed and reliable access control framework for smart cities by combining the blockchain smart contract technology and the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. The framework consists of one policy management contract (PMC) for managing the ABAC policies, one subject attribute management contract (SAMC) for managing the attributes of subjects (i.e., entities accessing resources), one object attribute management contract (OAMC) for managing the attributes of objects (i.e., resources being accessed), and one access control contract (ACC) for performing the access control. To show the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a local private Ethereum blockchain system to implement the four smart contracts and also conduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the proposed framework with an existing access control list (ACL)-based scheme. The experimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money than the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary cost during the system running especially for large-scale smart cities.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Construction projects usually involve signing various contracts with specific billing proce-dures. In practice, dealing with complex contract structures causes significant problems, especially with regard to timely payment and guaranteed cash flow. Furthermore, a lack of transparency leads to a loss of trust. As a result, late or non-payment is a common problem in the construction industry. This paper presents the concept of implementing smart contracts for automated, transparent, and traceable payment processing for construction projects. Automated billing is achieved by combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) approaches with blockchain-based smart contracts. Thereby, parts of traditional construction contracts are transferred to a smart contract. The smart contract is set up using digital BIM-based tender documents and contains all of the relevant data for financial transactions. Once the contracted construction work has been accepted by the client, payments can be made automatically via authorized financial institutions. This paper describes the framework, referred to as BIMcontracts, the container-based data exchange, and the digital contract management workflow. It discusses the industry-specific requirements for blockchain and data storage and explains which technical and software architectural decisions were made. A case study is used to demonstrate the current implementation of the concept. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Millions of smart contracts have been deployed onto the Ethereum platform, posing potential attack subjects. Therefore, analyzing contract binaries is vital since their sources are unavailable, involving identification comprising function entry identification and detecting its boundaries. Such boundaries are critical to many smart contract applications, e.g. reverse engineering and profiling. Unfortunately, it is challenging to identify functions from these stripped contract binaries due to the lack of internal function call statements and the compiler-inducing instruction reshuffling. Recently, several existing works excessively relied on a set of handcrafted heuristic rules which impose several faults. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural network-based framework for EVM bytecode Function Entries and Boundaries Identification (neural-FEBI) that does not rely on a fixed set of handcrafted rules. Instead, it used a two-level bi-Long Short-Term Memory network and a Conditional Random Field network to locate the function entries. The suggested framework also devises a control flow traversal algorithm to determine the code segments reachable from the function entry as its boundary. Several experiments on 38,996 publicly available smart contracts collected as binary demonstrate that neural-FEBI confirms the lowest and highest F1-scores for the function entries identification task across different datasets of 88.3 to 99.7, respectively. Its performance on the function boundary identification task is also increased from 79.4% to 97.1% compared with state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate that the identified function information can be used to construct more accurate intra-procedural CFGs and call graphs. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, often based on handcrafted heuristic rules. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly, modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming. In general, checking modularity is undecidable-even for programs without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to understand and fix the error. We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove modularity where other methods fail. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchain-based application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election. © 2018 IEEE.},
