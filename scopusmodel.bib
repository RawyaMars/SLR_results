	abstract = {Currently, there has been a paradigm shifted in the storing of electronic payment records (EPRs) on mobile distributed systems, wherein mobile devices are coupled with cloud computing to ease financial data transfers between consumers and stakeholders. This enhanced architecture allows low-cost online payment services with high versatility and EPR accessibility. Nevertheless, for e-payment platforms, such a new paradigm poses worries about data privacy and network security. A difficult challenge is how to reliably disseminate EPRs across mobile users while maintaining high-security security standards in the mobile cloud. This paper investigates and demonstrates the electronic payment approach of urban mobile pass cards' dependability and excellence. Furthermore, on a mobile cloud platform, our technology integrates blockchain with the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS). We specifically create a reliable access control method on smart contracts to ensure secure EPR sharing across various clients and stakeholders. Our empirical results indicate that our concept provides a viable solution for data transfers on mobile clouds while protecting critical payment information from potential attacks. When compared to previous data sharing models, the system evaluation and security analysis show performance gains in lightweight access control architecture, minimal network latency with excellent security and data confidentiality levels. © 2022 Xiaozhen Li and Xueli Shen.},

	abstract = {Promotional schemes, such as promotional points and coupons, are highly effective marketing tools. Through these schemes, merchants can obtain customer loyalty or attract new customers, and customers can obtain benefits when purchasing goods or services. Therefore, the use of promotional schemes is considered to be a win-win strategy. Promotional points are becoming an increasingly popular way of providing customers with discounts or gifts to incentivise the purchase of some products. However, some security issues should be addressed: forgery, double-spending, privacy, etc. Blockchain is gaining popularity in academic research and business applications, as it has the potential to change business models in numerous sectors of the economy. The characteristics of blockchain (security, immutability, efficiency, etc.) can help to provide secure solutions for blockchain-based applications in the marketing field. In this paper, we propose a multimerchant, blockchain-based promotional point scheme that allows points to be transferred between customers and preserves customers' privacy.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the blooming of blockchain-based smart contracts in decentralized applications, the security problem of smart contracts has become a critical issue, as vulnerable contracts have resulted in severe financial losses. Existing research works have explored vulnerability detection methods based on fuzzing, symbolic execution, formal verification, and static analysis. In this paper, we propose two static analysis approaches called ASGVulDetector and BASGVulDetector for detecting vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contacts from source-code and bytecode perspectives, respectively. First, we design a novel intermediate representation called abstract semantic graph (ASG) to capture both syntactic and semantic features from the program. ASG is based on syntax information but enriched by code structures, such as control flow and data flow. Then, we apply two different training models, i.e., graph neural network (GNN) and graph matching network (GMN), to learn the embedding of ASG and measure the similarity of the contract pairs. In this way, vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by calculating the similarity to labeled ones. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the superiority of our approaches to state-of-the-art competitors. Specifically, ASGVulDetector improves the best of three source-code-only static analysis tools (i.e., SmartCheck, Slither, and DR-GCN) regarding the F1 score by 12.6% on average, while BASGVulDetector improves that of the three detection tools supporting bytecode (i.e., ContractFuzzer, Oyente, and Securify) regarding the F1 score by 25.6% on average. We also investigate the effectiveness and advantages of the GMN model for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an on-device distributed learning scheme that does not require training devices to transfer their data to a centralized facility. The goal of federated learning is to learn a global model over several iterations. It is challenging to claim ownership rights and commercialize the global model efficiently and transparently. Additionally, incentives need to be provided to ensure that devices participate in the FL process. In this paper, we propose a smart contract-based framework called FL-Incentivizer, which relies on custom smart contracts to maintain flow governance of the FL process in a transparent and immutable manner. FL-Incentivizer commercializes and tokenizes the global model using FL-NFT (FL Non-Fungible Token) based on the ERC-721 standard. FL-Incentivizer uses ERC-20 compliant FL-Tokens to incentivize devices participating in FL. We present the system design and operational sequence of the FL-Incentivizer. We provide implementation and deployment details, complete smart contract codes, and qualitative evaluation of the FL-Incentivizer. After implementing FL-Incentivizer for a global iteration of a Federated learning task, we showed the FL-NFT on OpenSea and an FL-Token for a learner on MetaMask. FL-NFTs can be traded on markets such as OpenSea like other NFTs. While FL-Tokens can be transferred in the same manner as other ERC-20-based tokens.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An increasing amount of research focuses on integrating the Internet of Things and blockchain technology to address the requirements of traceability applications for Industry 4.0. However, there has been little quantitative analysis of several aspects of these new blockchain-based traceability systems. For instance, very few works have studied blockchain’s impact on the resources of constrained IoT sensors. Similarly, the infrastructure costs of these blockchain-based systems are not widely understood. This paper characterizes the resources of low-cost IoT sensors and provides a monetary cost model for blockchain infrastructure to support blockchain-based traceability systems. First, we describe and implement a farm-to-fork case study using public and private blockchain networks. Then, we analyze the impact of blockchain in six different resource-limited IoT devices in terms of disk and memory footprint, processing time, and energy consumption. Next, we present an infrastructure cost model and use it to identify the costs for the public and private networks. Finally, we evaluate the traceability of a product in different scenarios. Our results showed that low-cost sensors could directly interact with both types of blockchains with minimal energy overhead. Furthermore, our cost model showed that setting a private blockchain infrastructure costs approximately the same as that managing 50 products on a public blockchain network. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cloud storage is a popular model of the application in various fields, and the security of storage data and access permission have been widely considered. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) provides fine-grained user access control and ensures data confidentiality. However, current ABE access control schemes rely on trusted cloud servers and provide a low level of security. To solve these problems of traditional encryption schemes, we propose a blockchain-based and ABE cloud storage data access control scheme. In this article, blockchain and smart contract technology are the core elements to ensure data integrity and build a decentralized verification method for outsourcing results. This application can minimize the reliance on servers in the cloud environment. Based on the ciphertext-policy ABE algorithm, the proposed scheme supports a hidden access policy to avoid the risk of privacy leakage. In addition, we adopt outsourcing technology and predetected decryption algorithms to reduce the computational overhead of local and outsourced servers. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed scheme has high computational efficiency and satisfies the condition of indistinguishability under the chosen-ciphertext attacks.  © 2022 Xiaodong Yang et al.},

Thus, it is crucial and urgent to detect the vulnerabilities of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers for smart contracts are still inefficient to detect sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific vulnerable transaction sequences to trigger. To address this challenge, we propose a novel vulnerability-guided fuzzer based on reinforcement learning, namely RLF, for generating vulnerable transaction sequences to detect such sophisticated vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In particular, we firstly model the process of fuzzing smart contracts as a Markov decision process to construct our reinforcement learning framework. We then creatively design an appropriate reward with consideration of both vulnerability and code coverage so that it can effectively guide our fuzzer to generate specific transaction sequences to reveal vulnerabilities, especially for the vulnerabilities related to multiple functions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RLF's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our RLF outperforms state-of-the-art vulnerability-detection tools (e.g., detecting 8%-69% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes).  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Electric power systems are transitioning towards a decentralized paradigm with the engagement of active prosumers (both producers and consumers) through using distributed multi-energy sources. This paper proposes a novel Blockchain based peer-to-peer trading architecture which integrates negotiation-based auction and pricing mechanisms in local electricity markets, through automating, standardizing, and self-enforcing trading procedures using smart contracts. The negotiation of the volume and price of the peer-to-peer electricity trading among prosumers is modeled as a cooperative game, and the interaction between a retailer and its ensemble of prosumers is modeled as a Stackelberg game. The flexibility provision from residential heating systems is incorporated into the energy scheduling of prosumers. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed architecture in local electricity markets helps improve local energy balance. Flexibility from the residential heating systems enables prosumers to be more responsive to the variation of retail electricity prices. The proposed model reduces 41.24% of average daily electricity costs for individual prosumers or consumers compared to the case without the peer-to-peer electricity trading.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

A safe framework for training and invoking models called ISC-MTI (IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Smart Contract-Based Method for Storage and Invocation of Machine Learning Mobel) is proposed in this paper. The framework uses IPFS as the storage solution, EOS (Enterprise Operation System) blockchain as the smart contract platform, RSA and AES as the implementation of encrypted communication. The Action responsible for invoking the training data and trained models in the smart contract and the model training, uploading, and invoking methods are designed.

	abstract = {Hospitals provide diverse tasks essential for the delivery of patient care and are comprised of many functional units. This makes healthcare projects in construction highly complex among other types of building projects due to the specific regulations, multiple functions it must provide, complicated mechanical and electrical systems, and so on. This complexity embodies potential risk events during its construction, which not only influences the completion of the project but can impact the patients’ safety and health conditions even after the project is finished. To prevent such outcomes, risk management is a crucial process that can identify, evaluate, and properly mitigate risks along the project lifecycle. A key aspect of risk management is that it requires the interaction and contribution from multiple stakeholders of the project. Various frameworks and tools that enable collaborative management of risks among multiple stakeholders have been developed in the past. However, the developed frameworks are not suitable in the sense that it does not protect the confidentiality of individual inputs from the stakeholders. Moreover, these frameworks are centralized systems, which can bring issues related to the security and transparency of the information that is being stored. Blockchain technology is an emergent distributed ledger technology (DLT) that can provide solutions to the listed problems found in centralized systems. It is a novel system that records information on a decentralized, distributed ledger, where transactions are constantly duplicated and updated. This study explores the applicability of blockchain technology for healthcare risk management. The key functional elements of blockchain that can resolve the challenges faced by prior risk management frameworks have been identified and discussed. Based on the discussions, a conceptual information management model for managing healthcare project risks on a blockchain has been conceived. The development of the initial prototype has been explained. The research study illustrates the process, benefits, and limitations of adopting the blockchain technology for collaborative risk management in healthcare projects. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Digital freelancing refers to hiring potential employees to work on specific projects on a contract basis by organizations, companies, and individuals. Existing freelancing systems are based on client-server models and managed in a centralized way. Centralized freelancing systems are originating several issues: Lack of trust, payment delays, central control over all operations, less reliability, online frauds, and lack of fairness. Hence, we propose a decentralized freelancing system based on blockchain and biometrics. Blockchain in the freelancing system makes contracts decentralized, and no one can control the interaction and deals between buyers and sellers. Biometric signatures on smart contracts in the freelancing system enhance the authenticity and validity of agreements between buyers and sellers. Our decentralized freelancing system is an online web-based platform based on blockchain and biometrics and built on Python. It makes the interaction and deals between buyers and sellers via the innovative approach of smart contracts. The proposed work illustrates the development, implementation, and functionalities of the freelancing system, such as registration as buyer or seller, logging in to the system, posting a job, bidding on jobs, hiring process, finalizing deals with smart contracts having a biometric signature of both parties and distributing smart contracts among all stakeholders via blockchain. Our system proves the fairness, clarity, security, and reliability in all processes of posting and hiring without the involvement of any central management authority. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications called ÐApps onto the blockchain for public use through the use of smart contracts. To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be issued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a contract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners in the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that block to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and code execution. It is crucial for ÐApp developers to be able to precisely estimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define and provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the transactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different factors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time estimation services are used by ÐApp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet, these services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing times. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum blockchain, changes in processing times are hard for ÐApp developers to predict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build random forest models to understand the factors that are associated with transaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture blockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction issuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas pricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing times. Based on our empirical results, we provide ÐApp developers with concrete insights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology was created with security in mind. However, in recent years, there has been various confirmed cases of breach, worth billions of dollars loss in Blockchain associated to smart contracts. In order to address this growing concern, it is crucial to investigate detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in smart contract, and this paper critically reviews and analyses key approaches for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contract within Blockchain. In order to achieve the purpose of this paper, five key approaches, notably the application of OWASP Top 10, SCSVS, vulnerability detection tools, fuzz testing and the AI-driven approaches are critically reviewed and compared. As part of the comparison performed, a penetration testing quality model was applied to study six quality metrics, notably extensibility, maintainability, domain coverage, usability, availability and reliability. Results revealed limitations of the studied vulnerability detection approaches and findings are expected to help in decision making especially when selecting approaches to be used during security analysis and pen-testing. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With countless devices connected to the Internet of Things, trust mechanisms are especially important. IoT devices are more deeply embedded in the privacy of people’s lives, and their security issues cannot be ignored. Smart contracts backed by blockchain technology have the potential to solve these problems. Therefore, the security of smart contracts cannot be ignored. We propose a flexible and systematic hybrid model, which we call the Serial-Parallel Convolutional Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Network Model incorporating Ensemble Classifiers (SPCBIG-EC). The model showed excellent performance benefits in smart contract vulnerability detection. In addition, we propose a serial-parallel convolution (SPCNN) suitable for our hybrid model. It can extract features from the input sequence for multivariate combinations while retaining temporal structure and location information. The Ensemble Classifier is used in the classification phase of the model to enhance its robustness. In addition, we focused on six typical smart contract vulnerabilities and constructed two datasets, CESC and UCESC, for multi-task vulnerability detection in our experiments. Numerous experiments showed that SPCBIG-EC is better than most existing methods. It is worth mentioning that SPCBIG-EC can achieve F1-scores of 96.74%, 91.62%, and 95.00% for reentrancy, timestamp dependency, and infinite loop vulnerability detection. © 2022, MDPI.

	abstract = {As a temporary facility, scaffolding has an essential role in providing a work environment at height in the construction industry. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), approximately 65% of laborers work on scaffolding. Scaffolding work information needs to be effectively managed with reliability to provide a safe environment. However, managing information of the scaffolding work process remains challenging in forgery risk and manual verification. Blockchain has been widely introduced as an accountable and efficient information management solution. This study presents a blockchain-based system for scaffolding work to grant reliability and efficiency of information management. The system is developed to secure applicability by considering three aspects: (1) optimal blockchain platform regarding characteristics of scaffolding work; (2) storage method to address the hindrance of blockchain; (3) information needed to be compared for verifying adequacy. The detailed configuration and process model for the system is categorically presented, and validated via a case study. The case study confirmed that the system was able to store the information in the block smoothly, verify the information using the smart contract successfully, and remain the block size constant by using off-chain. The proposed system has the potential of practical applicability and could contribute to mitigate potential safety risks associated with inadequate scaffolding work management. Furthermore, the proposed system development flow can be leveraged as a guideline to extend blockchain applications to diverse areas in the construction domain.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Software licenses are legal agreements of sale and usage among software developers and clients. Such legal agreements are crucial to effectively manage ownership and protect the rights of involved parties. Today's software licensing mechanisms are mostly centralized and do not address the ever-increasing issues and complexities of modern software that may include multiple licenses, open-source distribution, rewarding other contributors of external software libraries, and utilizing royalty payments for monetization. As a result, developers have lost confidence in the existing software licensing models, and many software projects are failing due to lack of funding and royalty payments. This paper addresses such issues and complexities by proposing a novel decentralized software licensing system based on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. The proposed licensing system is applicable to both commercial and open-source software. We use NFTs as digital tokens that encapsulate software code and their artifacts by minting them as unique valuable assets that allow developers to store and manage them on a blockchain ledger. With NFTs, developers can register and license their code, monetize it on NFT marketplaces, and earn royalties from other software projects that use their code. We present system architecture, relevant sequence diagrams, and develop aggregation algorithms for Ethereum smart contracts with ERC-1155 NFTs. Furthermore, we perform functional validation of our system and analyze the cost of its adoption. We also analyze the security of the solution and show how its applicability can be generalized and extended. We have made our smart contract code and related testing scripts publicly available on GitHub.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to aggressive urbanization (with population size), waste increases exponentially, resulting in environmental damage. Even though it looks challenging, such an issue can be controlled if we can reuse them. To handle this, in our work, we design a machine learning and blockchain-oriented system that identifies the waste objects/products and recommends to the user multiple 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) ideas to reuse or recycle. Blockchain records every transaction in the shared ledger to enable transaction verifiability and supports better decision-making. In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on about 11700 images is developed using ResNet50 architecture for object recognition (training accuracy of 94%). We deploy several smart contracts in the Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain platform to validate recommended DIY ideas by blockchain network members. HF is a decentralized ledger technology platform that executes the deployed smart contracts in a secured Docker container to initialize and manage the ledger state. The complete model is delivered on a web platform using Flask, where our recommendation system works on a web scraping script written using Python. Fetching DIY ideas using web-scraping takes nearly 1 second on a desktop machine with an Intel Core-i7 processor with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, installed with Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system, and Python 3.6 package. Further, we evaluate blockchain-based smart contracts' latencies and throughput performances using the hyperledger caliper benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates blockchain technology and deep learning for the DIY recommender system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When cybersecurity is neglected, any network system loses its efficiency, reliability, and resilience. With the huge integration of the Information, Communication and Technology capabilities, the Connected Electric Vehicle (CEV) as a transportation form in cities is becoming more and more efficient and able to reply to citizen and environmental expectations which improve the quality of citizens- life. However, this CEV technological improvement increases the CEV vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks resulting to serious risks for citizens. Thus, they can intensify their negative impact on societies and cause unexpected physical damage and economic losses. This paper targets the cybersecurity issues for CEVs in parking lots where a peer-to-peer(P2P) energy transaction system based on blockchain, and smart contract scheme is launched. A False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) on the electricity price and power signal is proposed and a Machine Learning/SVM classification protocol is used to detect and extract the right values.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a blockchain-based node authentication model for the Internet of sensor things (IoST). The nodes in the network are authenticated based on their credentials to make the network free from malicious nodes. In IoST, sensor nodes gather the information from the environment and send it to the cluster heads (CHs) for additional processing. CHs aggregate the sensed information. Therefore, their energy rapidly depletes due to extra workload. To solve this issue, we proposed distance, degree, and residual energy-based low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (DDR-LEACH) protocol. DDR-LEACH is used to replace CHs with the ordinary nodes based on maximum residual energy, degree, and minimum distance from BS. Furthermore, storing a huge amount of data in the blockchain is very costly. To tackle this issue, an external data storage, named as interplanetary file system (IPFS), is used. Furthermore, for ensuring data security in IPFS, AES 128-bit is used, which performs better than the existing encryption schemes. Moreover, a huge computational cost is required using a proof of work consensus mechanism to validate transactions. To solve this issue, proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used in the proposed model. The simulation results are carried out, which show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system model. The DDR-LEACH is compared with LEACH and the simulation results show that DDR-LEACH outperforms LEACH in terms of energy consumption, throughput, and improvement in network lifetime with CH selection mechanism. Moreover, transaction cost is computed, which is reduced by PoA during data storage on IPFS and service provisioning. Furthermore, the time is calculated in the comparison of AES 128-bit scheme with existing scheme. The formal security analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of smart contract against attacks. Additionally, two different attacks, MITM and Sybil, are induced in our system to show our system model's resilience against cyber attacks. © 2022 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology in recent years, all kinds of blockchain-based applications have emerged. Among them, the decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which is regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the real-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. However, due to the deterministic nature of blockchain, the blockchain cannot directly obtain indeterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have appeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain applications. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study on oracles, especially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application scenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by categorizing them into several types based on their design features. After that, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use (such as Chainlink and Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data validation process, and their incentive mechanisms. Then, we compare these present DeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness, data source trustworthiness and their overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing trustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a few promising techniques for building future trustworthiness oracles.  © 2013 IEEE.},

With the utilization of blockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can be efficiently solved.

However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. In this article, we present SocialChain, which is a decentralized social data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and social applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the social data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner. We develop a software prototype based on Ethereum and conduct case studies to test the effects of the adopted techniques on the performance. Experimental results show that SocialChain can provide easy-to-use interfaces while introducing relatively low latency, cost, and overhead and that it can support real-world social media applications.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

However, many challenges need to be addressed to integrate the blockchain to DSA, such as the trustworthiness of participating nodes' spectrum sensing results, privacy protection of sensing nodes' identities, and affordable lightweight consensus algorithms for IoT devices. In this article, we propose a trust-centric privacy-preserving blockchain for DSA in IoT networks. To be specific, we propose a trust evaluation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensing nodes and design a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to build a scalable blockchain with high transaction-per-second (TPS). Moreover, a privacy protection scheme is proposed to protect sensors' real-time geolocation information when they upload sensing data to the blockchain. Two smart contracts are designed to make the whole procedure (spectrum sensing, spectrum auction, and spectrum allocation) run automatically. Simulation results demonstrate the expected computation cost of the PoT consensus algorithm for reliable nodes is low, and the cooperative sensing performance is improved with the help of the trust evaluation mechanism. In addition, incentivization and security are also analyzed, which show that our system can not only encourage nodes' participation, but also resist many kinds of attacks which are frequently arise in the trust management mechanism and blockchain-based IoT systems.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gaining importance as most technologies and applications are integrated with the IIoT. Moreover, it consists of several tiny sensors to sense the environment and gather the information. These devices continuously monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and transfer the captured data to nearby devices or servers using an open channel, i.e., in-ternet. However, such centralized system based on IIoT provides more vulnerabilities to security and privacy in IIoT networks. In order to resolve these issues, we present a blockchain-based deep-learning framework that provides two levels of security and privacy. First a blockchain scheme is designed where each participating entities are registered, verified, and thereafter validated using smart contract based enhanced Proof of Work, to achieve the target of security and privacy. Second, a deep-learning scheme with a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) technique for privacy and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for intrusion detection is designed. The experimental results are based on the IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets that are publicly available. The proposed simulations results are compared with the benchmark models and it is validated that the proposed framework outperforms the existing system. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cross-organisation data sharing is challenging because all the involved organisations must agree on 'how' and 'why' the data is processed. Due to a lack of transparency, the organisations need to trust that others comply with the agreements and regulations. We propose to exploit blockchain and smart contracts technologies to define an Attribute-Based Access Control System for cross-organisation medical records sharing, coined SmartAccess. SmartAccess offers joint agreement over access policies and dynamic access control besides blockchain transparency and auditability. We leverage the Attribute-Based Access Control model to implement smart contracts. We deploy and test them on a private and permissioned blockchain, transforming the access control process into a distributed smart contract execution. This paper proposes the SmartAccess system and its application in two healthcare use cases. We introduce the threat model and perform a security analysis of the system. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we implement a proof-of-concept of the smart contracts, written in Solidity language, with a size-efficient policy representation, and analyse the complexity and scalability of the contracts' functions. Furthermore, we present performance results, measuring the latency and throughput of the transactions to execute the access control functions with different blockchain network consensus setups. We also compare the performance of the SmartAccess system against two open-source Solidity implementations of smart contract-based access control, Role-based Access Control and Access Control List. Finally, we discuss the strengths and drawbacks of our proposal. SmartAccess requires the overhead of a decentralised system, but the trade-off is transparency, regulation compliance and auditability for complex cross-organisation data sharing. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The intelligence of energy storage devices has led to a sharp increase in the amount of detection data generated. Data sharing among distributed energy storage networks can realize collaborative control and comprehensive analysis, which effectively improves the clustering and intelligence. However, data security problems have become the main obstacle for energy storage devices to share data for joint modeling and analysis. The security issues caused by information leakage far outweigh property losses. In this article, we first proposed a blockchain-based machine learning scheme for secure data sharing in distributed energy storage networks. Then, we formulated the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating secure federated learning. Innovative verification methods and consensus mechanisms were used to encourage participants to act honestly, and to use well-designed incentive mechanisms to ensure the sustainable and stable operation of the system. We implemented the scheme of SFedChain and experimented on real datasets with different settings. The numerical results show that SFedChain is promising. © Copyright 2022 meng et al.},

	abstract = {Permission delegation has become a new way for data sharing by delegating the authorized permission to other users. A flexible authorization model with strict access control policies is promising for electronic health record (EHR) sharing with security. In this paper, a blockchain-based multi-hop permission delegation scheme with controllable delegation depth for EHR sharing has been presented. We use the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for storing the original EHRs. Smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology are implemented for permission delegation. In order to ensure data security, we use attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control. Additionally, blockchain is used to achieve traceability and immutability. We deploy smart contracts so that the delegation depth can be set by delegators. Security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that our solution meets the designed goals. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm and implement the scheme on the Ethereum test chain. Our scheme outperforms the competition in terms of performance, according to the results of our experiments. © 2022},

	abstract = {A blockchain is a data structure that is implemented as a distrusted database or digital ledger. The transactions are saved to a block of transactions that is attached in turn to the blockchain after the verification process, in which each block in the chain contains a hash signature of the previous block in addition to the hash signature of the block itself. The blocks on the blockchain are chained as an immutable list using the proof-of-work procedure, where there is no way to alter or delete an attached block due to the strict security policy used for structuring the chain of blocks. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain in which the miners take the responsibility of verifying and attaching blocks to the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain introduced the smart contract which holds logic to be processed once the contract is established. These smart contracts are developed via the Solidity programming language. This proposed paper exploits the Ethereum blockchain along with smart contracts as the base technology for implementing the proposed blockchain-based model. The paper aims to develop a multilayered blockchain-based model, in which the blockchain model is set up on a private blockchain Ethereum network where the nodes share the electronic medical records (EMR) among the P2P (peer-to-peer) network that will be used to secure the IoT medical transactions. Solidity smart contract, introduced by Ethereum, is deployed to handle the EMR “open-query-transfer” operations on the private network, whereas the miners are responsible to validate the transactions. Finally, the research conducts a performance analysis of the Ethereum network using the Ethereum Caliper, considering several performance factors, which are: Maximum Latency, Minimum Latency, Average Latency, and Throughput. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

	abstract = {Significant modifications have been seen in healthcare facilities over the past two decades. With the use of IoT-enabled devices, the monitoring and analysis of patient diagnostic parameters is made considerably easy. The new technology shift for medical field is IoMT. However, the problem of privacy for patient data and the security of information still a point to ponder. This research proposed a prototype model to integrate the blockchain and IoMT for providing better analysis of patient health factors. The authors suggested IoMT data to be collected over Edge Computing gateway devices and forward to Cloud Gateway. The three-layered decision making structure ensures the integrity of the data. The further analysis of information collected over sensor-based devices is done in the Cloud IoT Central Hub service. To ensure the secrecy and compliance of the patient data, Smart Contracts are integrated. After the exchange of smart contracts, a block of information is broadcast over the health blockchain. The P2P network makes it viable to retain all health statistics and further processing of information. The paper describes the scenario and experimental setup for a COVID-19 data-set analyzed in the proposed prototype mode. After the collection of information and decision making, the block of data is sent across all peer nodes. Thus, the power of IoMT and blockchain makes it easy for the healthcare worker to diagnose and handle patient data with privacy. The IoMT is integrated with artificial intelligence to enable decision making based on the classification of data. The results are saved as transactions in the blockchain hyperledger. This study demonstrates the prototype model with test data in a testing network with two peer nodes. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain presents a chance to address the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Things; however, blockchain itself has certain security issues. How to accurately identify smart contract vulnerabilities is one of the key issues at hand. Most existing methods require large-scale data support to avoid overfitting; machine learning (ML) models trained on small-scale vulnerability data are often difficult to produce satisfactory results in smart contract vulnerability prediction. However, in the real world, collecting contractual vulnerability data requires huge human and time costs. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposed an ensemble learning (EL)-based contract vulnerability prediction method, which is based on seven different neural networks using contract vulnerability data for contract-level vulnerability detection. Seven neural network (NN) models were first pretrained using an information graph (IG) consisting of source datasets, which then were integrated into an ensemble model called Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection method based on Information Graph and Ensemble Learning (SCVDIE). The effectiveness of the SCVDIE model was verified using a target dataset composed of IG, and then its performances were compared with static tools and seven independent data-driven methods. The verification and comparison results show that the proposed SCVDIE method has higher accuracy and robustness than other data-driven methods in the target task of predicting smart contract vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.

Ride-hailing service providers (SPs) usually collect users' personal data to improve their services via big data technologies. However, SPs may also use the collected user data to apply personalized prices to different users, which raises price fairness concerns. In this paper, we propose a smart price auditing system named Spas. Spas allows a user to purchase Fair Price Insurance in the form of Price Auditing Contract, then the price of ride-hailing service (RHS) order will be audited automatically once completed. According to the auditing result, the contract punishes misbehaving SPs and also compensates affected users automatically. By replacing an untrustworthy centralized auditor with carefully designed smart contracts, we construct a decentralized price auditing system which is trustworthy and transparent. We demonstrate a theoretical model for practical payment flows based on real RHS user data and we implement Spas in Hyperledger Fabric to show that decentralizing and automating price auditing for RHS with financial incentives is technically feasible. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model's detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as CodeBERT require the availability of large-scale code corpora. However, gathering training samples can be costly and infeasible for domain-specific languages such as Solidity for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose Zecoler, a zero-shot learning approach for code representations. Zecoler is built upon a pre-trained programming language model. In order to elicit knowledge from the pre-trained models efficiently, Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training tasks by inserting trainable prompts into the original input. Then, it employs the prompt learning technique to optimize the pre-trained model by merely adjusting the original input. This enables the representation model to efficiently fit the scarce task-specific data while reusing pre-trained knowledge. We evaluate Zecoler in three code intelligence tasks in two programming languages that have no training samples, namely, Solidity and Go, with model trained in corpora of common languages such as Java. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in the fourth industrial revolution. The sophistication of technology due to the integration of heterogenous smart devices open a new threat from various aspects. Access control is the first line of defence to ensure that IoT resources are secure by preventing illegitimate users from gaining access to these resources. However, access control mechanisms face the limitation of technology in large scale IoT deployments since they are based on a centralized architecture. Significant research concerning decentralized access control solutions for securing IoT resources using combined techniques, such as blockchain, have caught much research attention in recent years. Nevertheless, research for decentralized access control for application in smart farming domain remain as a gap. Thus, this study presented a structured literature review on 81 articles related to the field of access control in IoT and blockchain technology to understand the challenges of centralized access control in securing IoT resources. This study serves as a foundation for decentralized access control using blockchain technology and its application to ensure the IoT actuators and sensors security with the aim to be applied in smart farming.

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is always one of the major problems for service providers. Using blockchain to detect DDoS attacks is one of the current popular methods. However, the problems of high time overhead and cost exist in the most of the blockchain methods for detecting DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a blockchain-based collaborative detection method for DDoS attacks. First, the trained DDoS attack detection model is encrypted by the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which provides high security for uploading the DDoS attack detection model to the blockchain. Secondly, the service provider uploads the encrypted model to Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) and then a corresponding Content-ID (CID) is generated by IPFS which greatly saves the cost of uploading encrypted models to the blockchain. In addition, due to the small amount of model data, the time cost of uploading the DDoS attack detection model is greatly reduced. Finally, through the blockchain and smart contracts, the CID is distributed to other service providers, who can use the CID to download the corresponding DDoS attack detection model from IPFS. Blockchain provides a decentralized, trusted and tamper-proof environment for service providers. Besides, smart contracts and IPFS greatly improve the distribution efficiency of the model, while the distribution of CID greatly improves the efficiency of the transmission on the blockchain. In this way, the purpose of collaborative detection can be achieved, and the time cost of transmission on blockchain and IPFS can be considerably saved. We designed a blockchain-based DDoS attack collaborative detection framework to improve the data transmission efficiency on the blockchain, and use IPFS to greatly reduce the cost of the distribution model. In the experiment, compared with most blockchain-based method for DDoS attack detection, the proposed model using blockchain distribution shows the advantages of low cost and latency. The remote authentication mechanism of Intel SGX provides high security and integrity, and ensures the availability of distributed models. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The dominance of a few big companies in the storage market arising various concerns including single point of failure, privacy violation, and oligopoly. To eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj have been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage platform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the storage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers during a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to continuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of the storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore end-users. Moreover, DSN&#x0027;s PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying attack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while denying the service to the client. Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper introduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is conducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage service as a non-cooperative repeated dynamic game and set the players&#x0027; payoffs such that the storage provider&#x0027;s dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage contract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle network to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider efficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain platform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract execution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme using solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis demonstrates the applicability of our scheme. The outcome of this paper is a new incentive-compatible mechanism designed carefully for the blockchain-based DSN. The proposed mechanism utilizes different tools including game-theory, smart-contract, oracle network, and Merkle tree to improve the security and performance of storage verification in DSN. IEEE},

	abstract = {The emergence of on-demand service provisioning by Federated Cloud Providers (FCPs) to Cloud Users (CU) has fuelled significant innovations in cloud provisioning models. Owing to the massive traffic, massive CU resource requests are sent to FCPs, and appropriate service recommendations are sent by FCPs. Currently, the Fourth-Generation (4G)-Long Term Evolution (LTE) network faces bottlenecks that affect end-user throughput and latency. Moreover, the data is exchanged among heterogeneous stakeholders, and thus trust is a prime concern. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Blockchain (BC)-leveraged rank-based recommender scheme, FedRec, to expedite secure and trusted Cloud Service Provisioning (CSP) to the CU through the FCP at the backdrop of base 5G communication service. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a BC-integrated request-response broker model is formulated between the CU, Cloud Brokers (BR), and the FCP, where a CU service request is forwarded through the BR to different FCPs. For service requests, Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is supported by 5G-enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service. In the next phase, a weighted matching recommender model is proposed at the FCP sites based on a novel Ranking-Based Recommender (RBR) model based on the CU requests. In the final phase, based on the matching recommendations between the CU and the FCP, Smart Contracts (SC) are executed, and resource provisioning data is stored in the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) that expedite the block validations. The proposed scheme FedRec is compared in terms of SC evaluation and formal verification. In simulation, FedRec achieves a reduction of 27.55% in chain storage and a transaction throughput of 43.5074 Mbps at 150 blocks. For the IPFS, we have achieved a bandwidth improvement of 17.91%. In the RBR models, the maximum obtained hit ratio is 0.9314 ​at 200 million CU requests, showing an improvement of 1.2% in average servicing latency over non-RBR models and a maximization trade-off of QoE index of 2.7688 at the flow request 1.088 and at granted service price of USD 1.559 million to FCP for provided services. The obtained results indicate the viability of the proposed scheme against traditional approaches. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people.

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information.

	abstract = {Enterprises have paid attention to consortium blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric, which is one of the most promising platforms, for efficient decentralized transactions without depending on any particular organization. A consortium blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple organizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across multiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the value of introducing consortium blockchains. Decentralized system operations have recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of consortium blockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which individual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command execution of configuration change of channels (Fabric’s sub-networks) and upgrade of chaincodes (Fabric’s smart contracts), can be partially executed in a decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include the preceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the operational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations, after which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure relies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient decentralized operations workflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose a decentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations Smart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart contract. Furthermore, we design and implement OpsSC for blockchain network operations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC for operating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the blockchain networks, through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations. A cost evaluation based on an estimation model shows that the total operational cost for executing a typical operational scenario to add an organization to a blockchain network having ten organizations could be reduced by 54 percent compared with a conventional script-based method. The implementation of OpsSC has been open-sourced and registered as one of Hyperledger Labs projects, which hosts experimental projects approved by Hyperledger. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

	abstract = {Compiler correctness is an old problem, but with the emergence of smart contracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control (valuable) assets in an adversarial environment; once committed to the blockchain, these smart contracts cannot be modified. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler has correctly translated the source code to the given low-level code. Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also squarely addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate a modular verification methodology and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler implementation. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

But the traditional crowdsourcing system is not advanced enough to adapt to the new environment. Typically, traditional crowdsourcing workflow is hosted by a centralized crowdsourcing platform. However, the centralized crowdsourcing platform faces the following problems: (1) single point of failure, (2) user privacy leakage, (3) subjective arbitration, (4) additional service fee, and (5) non-transparent task assignment process. To improve those problems, we replaced the centralized crowdsourcing platform with a decentralized blockchain infrastructure. And we analyzed the challenge problems of multi-skilled spatial crowdsourcing tasks in the blockchain crowdsourcing system. In addition, a crowdsourcing task allocation algorithm has been proposed, which implements a transparent task distribution process and can adapt to the computing-constrained environment on the blockchain. Compared with the TSWCrowd blockchain-based crowdsourcing model, our system has a higher task allocation rate under the same conditions. And the experimental result shows our work has good economic feasibility, which decentralizes the crowdsourcing process and significantly reduces the additional consumption of the crowdsourcing process. © 2022, The Author(s).},

However, the absence of a more robust authentication method for DHCP servers makes hosts susceptible to attacks since neither the server nor the users are able to check the other’s authenticity during DHCP connections. These concerns result in both internal and external threats to the system that have the potential to impair network services. Among these threats are malicious DHCP servers and DHCP starvation. This paper aims to provide a novel approach for tackling these issues and protect the DHCP protocol. The proposed model uses the Diffie–Hellman key exchange mechanism, the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), a one-way hash function, blockchain technology, and a smart contract. In addition, registration and validation processes provide support for the proposed model in combating DHCP risks for both internal and external system threats. Results from this study show that the proposed model has an average of 21.1% more resistance to a growing number of adversaries than the benchmark models, thus revealing that the model is better suited for the security of IoT address management servers in smart homes, thereby enhancing resilience against related threats and the success of IP address management. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts can support the decentralisation of business processes, but due to smart contracts’ specifics, their development is a complicated process. Introducing model-driven development principles in smart contract development can facilitate requirement specification, design, and implementation activities. This paper presents a model-driven development method MDAsmartCD (Model-Driven Architecture-based Smart Contract Development) to alleviate smart contract development by supporting the complete MDA life cycle, covering the definition of Computation-Independent Model, Platform-Independent Model, and two instances of Platform-Specific Models. In MDAsmartCD, model transformations (model-to-model and model-to-text) are used to produce smart contract code in the Hyperledger Fabric platform Go and the Ethereum platform Solidity programming languages. The method application was demonstrated by implementing the smart contract for the hackathon solution and executing the generated Solidity and Go smart contracts in the workflow of issuing certificates for hackathon participants. During the execution of the workflow, both deployed smart contracts behaved identically and recorded analogous results in respective blockchain data storages. This demonstrated that the MDAsmartCD method enables the generation of compilable and executable smart contract code, ready for deployment on a blockchain platform. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of new technology has the potential to disrupt and transform an existing system as well as information technology. This study aims to build a proposed model in order to transform an old system into a Blockchain-based system. The smallholder oil palm supply chain currently uses a traditional information system and technology, hence its integrity, transparency, and security are vulnerable. To solve this problem, frontier technology is needed, such as a blockchain, which has trust, transparency, and traceable characteristics to improve performance and quality. The method used in this study was digital transformation in the context of operational processes and technology. In addition, the As-Is To-Be model was used as a mechanism to develop a transformation model for the smallholder oil palm supply chain system. Specifically, the As-Is model was implemented in identifying and analyzing the information system and technology in an already existing system, while the To-Be was used to determine the blockchain potential and characteristics. This becomes the proposed model for the transformation of the old system into a Blockchain technology-based. Also, a prospective and mechanism for system transformation were produced in the aspect of transactions, data, and architecture, as well as the flow of change strategies needed in the transformation of the blockchain-based smallholder oil palm supply chain system. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

	abstract = {In order to realize a general-purpose automatic formal verification platform based on WebAssembly technology as a web service (FVPS), which aims to provide an automated report of vulnerability detections, this work builds a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain runtime model. It proposes an optimized methodology of the functional equivalent translation from source program languages to formal languages. This methodology utilizes an external application programming interface (API) table to replace the source codes in compilation, thereby pruning the part of housekeeping codes to ease code inflation. Code inflation is a significant metric in formal language translation. Namely, minor code inflation enhances verification scale and performance efficiency. It determines the efficiency of formal verification, involving launching, running, and memory usage. For instance, path explosion increases exponentially, resulting in out-of-memory. The experimental results conclude that program languages like golang severely impact code inflation. FVPS reduces the wasm code size by over 90%, achieving two orders of optimization magnitude, from 2000 kilobyte (KB) to 90 KB. That means we can cope with golang applications up to 20 times larger than the original in scale. This work eliminates the gap between Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts and WebAssembly. Our approach is pragmatic, adaptable, extendable, and flexible. Nowadays, FVPS is successfully applied in a Railway-Port-Aviation blockchain transportation system. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

	abstract = {Recently, security issues of smart contracts are arising great attention due to the enormous financial loss caused by vulnerability attacks. There is an increasing need to detect similar codes for hunting vulnerability with the increase of critical security issues in smart contracts. Binary similarity detection that quantitatively measures the given code diffing has been widely adopted to facilitate critical security analysis. However, due to the difference between common programs and smart contract, such as diversity of bytecode generation and highly code homogeneity, directly adopting existing graph matching and machine learning based techniques to smart contracts suffers from low accuracy, poor scalability and the limitation of binary similarity on function level. Therefore, this paper investigates graph neural network to detect smart contract binary code similarity at the program level, where we conduct instruction-level normalization to reduce the noise code for smart contract pre-processing and construct contract control flow graphs to represent smart contracts. In particular, two improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models are explored to encode the contract graphs into quantitatively vectors, which can capture the semantic information and the program-wide control flow information with temporal orders. Then we can efficiently accomplish the similarity detection by measuring the distance between two targeted contract embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficient of our proposed method, extensive experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, i.e., smart contracts from Ethereum and Enterprise Operation System (EOS) blockchain-based platforms. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, achieving a great improvement up to 6.1% and 17.06% in accuracy. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system. The study discovered a significant influence of information quality and user satisfaction. On the contrary, system quality seems to have an almost significant influence on the use and user satisfaction of the proposed system. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Each time a new operation transpires on the Blockchain, an irreversible information of that transaction is buffered in all connected ledgers. Each distributed ledger is programmable, immutable and timestamped. This paper follows an immutable policy to ensure chronological trust-administration, security and privacy to resolve anomalies within linearly stored blocks. To prove the validity of submitted data, a consensus mechanism is required, which was attained by implementing a novel ‘Rampant Smoothing Algorithm’ that was encoded using Solidity (i.e., aimed at developing smart contracts). Experimental policies were aligned with Good Clinical Data Management Practices that portrayed effective ‘smart contract modeling’ to demonstrate resistance against majority consensus attacks by harnessing the core feature of ‘privacy decentralization’.

Aiming at the problems of policy centralization and single point of failure in traditional access control schemes, a distributed access control method based on adaptive trust evaluation and smart contract is proposed to provide fine-grained, flexible and scalable authorization for IoT devices with limited resources. Firstly, a modular access control architecture with integrated blockchain is proposed to achieve hierarchical management of IoT devices. Secondly, an IoT trust evaluation model called AITTE based on adaptive fusion weights is designed to effectively improve the identification of illegal access requests from malicious nodes. Finally, an attribute-based access control model using smart contract called AACSC which is built, which consists of attribute set contract (ASC), registration contract (RC), state judgment contract (SJC), authority permission management contract (AMC), and access control contract (ACC). As experimental results show, the scheme can effectively solve the problem of access security in resource-constrained IoT environments. Moreover, it also ensures the reliability and efficiency of the access control implementation process. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT.  © 2022 IEEE.},

AGAPECert utilizes a novel mix of trusted execution environments, blockchain technologies, and a real-time graph-based API standard to provide automated, oblivious, and auditable certification. Our technique allows a privacy-conscious data owner to run pre-approved <italic>Oblivious Smart Contract</italic> code in their own environment on their own private data to produce Private Automated Certifications. These certifications are verifiable, purely functional transformations of the available data, enabling a third party to trust that the private data must have the necessary properties to produce the resulting certification. Recently, a multitude of solutions for certification and traceability in supply chains have been proposed. These often suffer from significant privacy issues because they tend to take a &#x201D;shared, replicated database&#x201D; approach: every node in the network has access to a copy of all relevant data and contract code to guarantee the integrity and reach consensus, even in the presence of malicious nodes. In these contexts of certifications that require global coordination, AGAPECert can include a blockchain to guarantee ordering of events, while keeping a core privacy model where private data is not shared outside of the data owner&#x2019;s own platform. AGAPECert contributes an open-source certification framework that can be adopted in any regulated environment to keep sensitive data private while enabling a trusted automated workflow. IEEE},

The results showed that the importance of blockchain technology to improve governance and information flow along supply chains has increased, and this is the main perceived benefit. The main disadvantages were removing intermediaries and the high cost of implementing the technology. The absence of a widely accepted platform in blockchain operations is the leading and growing challenge, while patterns for blockchain technology seem to be being overcome.

	abstract = {Static analysis of smart-contracts is becoming more widespread on blockchain platforms. Analyzers rely on techniques like symbolic execution or model checking, but few of them can provide strong soundness properties and guarantee the analysis termination at the same time. As smart-contracts often manipulate economic assets, proving numerical properties beyond the absence of runtime errors is also desirable. Smart-contract execution models differ considerably from mainstream programming languages and vary from one blockchain to another, making state-of-the-art analyses hard to adapt. For instance, smart-contract calls may modify a persistent storage impacting subsequent calls. This makes it difficult for tools to infer invariants %and high-level security properties required to formally ensure the absence of exploitable vulnerabilities. The Michelson smart-contract language, used in the Tezos blockchain, is strongly typed, stack-based, and has a strict execution model leaving few opportunities for implicit runtime errors. We present a work in progress static analyzer for Michelson based on Abstract Interpretation and implemented within MOPSA, a modular static analyzer. Our tool supports the Michelson semantic features, including inner calls to external contracts. It can prove the absence of runtime errors and infer invariants on the persistent storage over an unbounded number of calls. It is also being extended to prove high-level numerical and security properties.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Mobile service providers (MSPs) are particularly vulnerable to roaming frauds, especially ones that exploit the long delay in the data exchange process of the contemporary roaming management systems, causing multi-billion dollars loss each year. In this paper, we introduce BlockRoam, a novel blockchain-based roaming management system that provides an efficient data exchange platform among MSPs and mobile subscribers. Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an effective method to guarantee the uniqueness of this game's equilibrium. The performance evaluations show that the proposed economic model helps the MSPs to earn additional profits, attracts more investment to the blockchain network, and enhances the network's security and performance.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud servers, storing data on cloud servers has become a popular option. However, cloud servers are centralized. Storing data on centralized cloud servers may involve some risks. For example, the data access pattern may be revealed when accessing data on cloud servers. Therefore, protecting a user’s patterns has become a crucial concern. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a candidate solution to hide the data access pattern. However, it inherently induces some overhead of accessing data, and many blockchain-based applications also do not consider the access pattern leakage issues. In this paper, we address these issues above by proposing a decentralized database system with oblivious access in a (parallel) smart contract model. The interactions of oblivious access are asymmetric where the smart contract side is expected to put much effort into computation. The proposed system slightly reduces the overhead of ORAM and overcomes the issues stemming from the centralization of servers. The main techniques are to use the garbled circuits to reduce the cost of communication and to combine with the parallel smart contract model to (conceptually) improve the performance of smart contract execution on the blockchain. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Energy has always been one of the fundamental elements in the growth of human society. It is crucial that we improve our energy management due to the ever-growing imbalance in demand-supply. The new wave in the energy sector is characterized by the three D's of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. For a sustainable life, it is necessary that energy is tapped from alternative sources that are renewable to leave a minimal carbon footprint. To integrate different sources with the main power grid, we require two-way communication among them. This makes it indispensable that consumers are empowered to protect their privacy and make them the sole owners of their data. A good access control scheme would ensure security of data, and an efficient trading platform would ensure judicious use of the resources. Here, we propose a framework URJA with an access control scheme and an energy trading platform based on blockchain for a smart grid. The locally available renewable sources of energy are connected to the grid such that demand-supply is managed effectively without loss of efficiency and privacy. A customized consensus scheme based on trust ensures a quick operation in real-time. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays, cloud-based storage systems play a vital role in IoT data storage, processing, and sharing. Despite its contribution, the current cloud-based architecture may cause severe data leakage or jeopardize user privacy. Meanwhile, the cloud-based architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party auditor (TPA) and runs in a centralized control manner. However, the TPA may not be a completely trustworthy entity, and a single point of failure might cause the centralized system to collapse. Fortunately, with the advent of blockchain technology, the decentralized storage model has gained popularity. A decentralized storage system successfully eradicates the rule of TPA, solves the problem of a single point of failure, and has many advantages over a centralized control architecture, such as low storage prices and high throughput. This study offers a blockchain-based decentralized distributed storage and sharing scheme that provides end-to-end encryption and fine-grained access control. In our proposed IoTChain model, fine-grained permission is based on attribute-based access control (A-BAC) policy by employing the Ethereum blockchain as an auditable access control layer. Smart contracts are tailored for the IoTChain model, which combines the Ethereum blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS). We used an advanced encryption standard (AES) for encryption and the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for secret key sharing between data owners and users. Also, the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is replaced with a proof-of-authority (PoA) to minimize system transaction cost and boost system throughput. Additionally, our solution has been tested on the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the results demonstrate that our approach is realistic and economical on the IoT data.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is among the highest rated digital crypto-currency in financial investment markets. This technology relies on a backbone of distributed data architecture and peer-to-peer networking model called Blockchain. Unlike the current digital economy, which is governed centrally by financial institution or governments, Blockchain is fully autonomous without any third-party involvement. The exorbitant success of Bitcoin has attracted investors, scholars as well as organizations to peek into this lucrative technology for the possible application to other areas apart from crypto-currency. Blockchain can adopt Smart Contracts, which are digitally enabled contracts that can be executed and enforced fully or partially using pre-defined notions. The aim of this research is to investigate the synergy between Smart Contract and Blockchain to propose a digital framework for an academic paper publication model that has the capability to automate the entire process and challenge the existing system. It can also bring together all the stakeholders under the same system. The proposed model can further hold the stakeholders accountable for breach of contracts and/or reward them for executing the successes of terms pre-configured in the Smart Contract. The proposed model, called Digital Smart Publication or DSP (as referred in the document), is highly secure and ensures balance in distributing rewards to the involved stakeholders while keeping data integrity and security as paramount features. © 2019, Amol Thakre, Fadi Thabtah, Seyed Reza Shahamiri and Suhel Hammoud.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has gained huge traction in recent years because of its potential to make informed decisions. A large portion of today’s deep learning systems are based on centralized servers and fall short in providing operational transparency, traceability, reliability, security, and trusted data provenance features. Also, training deep learning models by utilizing centralized data is vulnerable to the single point of failure problem. In this paper, we explore the importance of integrating blockchain technology with deep learning. We review the existing literature focused on the integration of blockchain with deep learning. We classify and categorize the literature by devising a thematic taxonomy based on seven parameters; namely, blockchain type, deep learning models, deep learning specific consensus protocols, application area, services, data types, and deployment goals. We provide insightful discussions on the state-of-the-art blockchain-based deep learning frameworks by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we compare the existing blockchain-based deep learning frameworks based on four parameters such as blockchain type, consensus protocol, deep learning method, and dataset. Finally, we present important research challenges which need to be addressed to develop highly trustworthy deep learning frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the interest in using wireless communication technologies and mobile devices in the healthcare environment has increased. However, despite increased attention to the security of electronic health records, patient privacy is still at risk for data breaches. Thus, it is quite a challenge to involve an access control system especially if the patient's medical data are accessible by users who have diverse privileges in different situations. Blockchain is a new technology that can be adopted for decentralized access control management issues. Nevertheless, different scalability, security, and privacy challenges affect this technology. To address these issues, we suggest a novel Decentralized Self-Management of data Access Control (DSMAC) system using a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model for privacy-preserving medical data, empowering patients with mechanisms to preserve control over their personal information and allowing them to self-grant access rights to their medical data. DSMAC leverages smart contracts to conduct Role-based Access Control policies and adopts the implementation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to describe advanced access control techniques for emergency cases. Finally, by evaluating performance and comparing analyses with other schemes, DSMAC can satisfy the privacy requirements of medical systems in terms of privacy, scalability, and sustainability, and offers a new approach for emergency cases.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Driven by the observation that smart contract operations and contract-level properties can be naturally expressed as relational constraints, DeCon models each smart contract as a set of relational tables that store transaction records. This relational representation of smart contracts enables convenient specification of contract properties, facilitates run-time monitoring of potential property violations, and brings clarity to contract debugging via data provenance. Specifically, a DeCon program consists of a set of declarative rules and violation query rules over the relational representation, describing the smart contract implementation and contract-level properties, respectively. We have developed a tool that can compile DeCon programs into executable Solidity programs, with instrumentation for run-time property monitoring. Our case studies demonstrate that DeCon can implement realistic smart contracts such as ERC20 and ERC721 digital tokens. Our evaluation results reveal the marginal overhead of DeCon compared to the open-source reference implementation, incurring 14% median gas overhead for execution, and another 16% median gas overhead for run-time verification.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {In modern society, the food supply chain management system has become an important research area realized nationally and internationally, which has established a collaborative relationship between producers, manufacturers, processors and retailers. Now, consumers are more interested in food quality, safety and the authentication of the products. Food safety has become an important issue in public health in the food market because people of all types and races around the world are affected due its poor quality. The traditional supply chains are centralized and face different issues such as lack of transparency, accountability and audit ability. The general issues in supply chain management include lack of communication, trust among the stakeholders, and interference of entities and wastage of food. A lot of work has been completed by researchers to address the above issues, but still, there is a need for effective mechanisms for the modeling of supply chain management systems. In this paper, a trusted, self-organized, traceable formal system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) is developed by using wireless sensors networks and finite automata. In the proposed model, smart contracts are designed to assure the automated payment procedures. The proposed model reduced the need for centralized authority. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to realize the requirements, and automata is used to capture behavior of the system. A blockchain-based model is used to provides the privacy and security mechanism for the transitions record. Wireless sensors are used to sense the information, and actors are used for decision making in case of any violation in the contact. A lot of work has been completed by researchers on smart contracts. Different smart contracts are designed to achieve the better traceability among producers, transporter/logistics and consumers. Our system provides the smart contract algorithm to show the interaction of entities in the food supply chain management system. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL) is used to describe the formal system and the VDM-SL toolbox is used for the validation and analysis of the system. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Classical health insurance management system runs on a manually controlled centralized architecture which leverages a vulnerable single point failure and requires frequent human intervention. This makes the model prone to human errors and security attacks. The existing system also lacks the flexibility to choose appropriate health insurance policies for different consumers. To this end, we propose an Ethereum blockchain-based framework, ChainSure, to address this problem. With the power of TOPSIS and smart contracts, ChainSure provides an automated, tamperproof, transparent, scalable system that takes care of all the major functional blocks in a medical insurance environment. We have used the TOPSIS method in this proposed model to help the users to find an insurance policy that best suits their needs. ChainSure works in a decentralized environment and provides an interactive interface for the user. The proposed model is implemented on the Ethereum test network and its performance has been compared empirically with other state-of-art models. ChainSure is found to outperform others in terms of service integrity, latency and cost. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts are computer programs that are deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain to enforce agreements among untrusting parties. Being the most prominent platform that supports smart contracts, Ethereum has been targeted by many attacks and plagued by security incidents. Consequently, many smart contract vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past decade. To detect and prevent such vulnerabilities, different security analysis tools, including static and dynamic analysis tools, have been created, but their performance decreases drastically when codes to be analyzed are constantly being rewritten. In this paper, we propose Eth2Vec, a machine-learning-based static analysis tool that detects smart contract vulnerabilities. Eth2Vec maintains its robustness against code rewrites; i.e., it can detect vulnerabilities even in rewritten codes. Other machine-learning-based static analysis tools require features, which analysts create manually, as inputs. In contrast, Eth2Vec uses a neural network for language processing to automatically learn the features of vulnerable contracts. In doing so, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts by comparing the similarities between the codes of a target contract and those of the learned contracts. We performed experiments with existing open databases, such as Etherscan, and Eth2Vec was able to outperform a recent model based on support vector machine in terms of well-known metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and F1-score. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the current era, the skyrocketing demand for energy necessitates a powerful mechanism to mitigate the supply–demand gap in intelligent energy infrastructure, i.e., the smart grid. To handle this issue, an intelligent and secure energy management system (EMS) could benefit end-consumers participating in the Demand–Response (DR) program. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a real-time and secure incentive-based EMS for smart grid, i.e., RI-EMS approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and blockchain technology. In the RI-EMS approach, we proposed a novel reward mechanism for better convergence of the RL-based model using a Q-learning approach based on the greedy policy that guides the RL-agent for faster convergence. Then, the proposed RI-EMS approach designed a real-time incentive mechanism to minimize energy consumption in peak hours and reduce end-consumers’ energy bills to provide incentives to the end-consumers. Experimental results show that the proposed RI-EMS approach induces end-consumer participation and increases customer profitabilities compared to existing approaches considering the different performance evaluation metrics such as energy consumption for end-consumers, energy consumption reduction, and total cost comparison to end-consumers. Furthermore, blockchain-based results are simulated and analyzed with the help of deployed smart contracts in a Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the parameters such as transaction efficiency and data storage cost. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the Internet of things (IoT) has recently gained attention in developing various smart city applications such as smart healthcare, smart supply chain, smart home, smart grid, etc. The existing literature focuses on the smart healthcare system as a public emergency service (PES) to provide timely treatment to the patient. However, little attention is given to a distributed smart fire brigade system as a PES to protect human life and properties from severe fire damage. The traditional PES are developed on a centralised system, which requires high computation and does not ensure timely service fulfilment. Furthermore, these traditional PESs suffer from a lack of trust, transparency, data integrity, and a single point of failure issue. In this context, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Secure and Trusted (BEST) framework for PES in the smart city environment. The BEST framework focuses on providing a fire brigade service as a PES to the smart home based on IoT device information to protect it from serious fire damage. Further, we used two edge computing servers, an IoT controller and a service controller. The IoT and service controller are used for local storage and to enhance the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfilments, respectively. The IoT controller manages an access control list to keep track of registered IoT gateways and their IoT devices, avoiding misguiding the PES department. The service controller utilised the queue model to handle the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. Further, various smart contracts are designed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform to automatically call a PES either in the presence or absence of the smart-home owner under uncertain environmental conditions. The performance evaluation of the proposed BEST framework indicates the benefits of utilising the distributed environment and the smart contract logic. The various simulation results are evaluated in terms of service queue length, utilisation, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, number of PES departments, number of PES providers, and end-to-end delay. These simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the BEST framework. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In most countries, traffic congestion has reached a level where managing traffic is tedious for regulatory bodies. The traffic management faced many issues such as route routing based on congestion, delivery of messages/emails to end-users, and real-time allocation of parking slots. There have been many works on predicting parking prices for traffic management, but most favor users or owners and are not secure. To address these issues, a blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS)-based parking price prediction scheme (PADaaV) is proposed to facilitate the users to reserve a parking slot securely and efficiently. It mainly focuses on ensuring security, privacy, and transparency for parking slot owners and users. Furthermore, we employ a second price auction model to optimize the parking price for users, and parking slot owners can also get benefit from it. The performance of the PADaaV has been simulated for 100 users with 40 parking slots based on different auction models. The various performance parameters considered are profit for users, profit for parking slot owners, overall revenue of the system, scalability, computation time, and data storage cost. The performance results show that the PADaaV is secure and beneficial for users and parking slot owners.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely deployed in military surveillance operations, especially the quadcopter UAVs which are easy to operate and considerably quieter. However, UAVs encounter problems in secure path planning during navigation and are prone to cyber security attacks. Further, due to the UAV battery capacity, the operating time for surveillance is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Resilient UAV Path Optimization Algorithm (RUPOA) which provides an optimal path under security attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The performance efficiency of the proposed path planning algorithm is compared with the existing path planning algorithms based on execution time. To achieve secure path planning in UAVs and to mitigate security attacks, a blockchain-aided security solution is proposed. To prevent security attacks, smart contracts are generated where the devices are registered with gasLimit. The blockchain consensus mechanism allows for secure and tamper-free transmission of data between the Ground Control Station (GCS) and a swarm of UAVs. The performance efficiency of the blockchain model is evaluated based on network latency which is the total execution time across the blockchain network. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Malicious users can upload illegal data to the blockchain to spread it, resulting in serious threats due to the tamper-proof characteristics of the blockchain. However, the existing methods for uploading illegal data identification cannot select trust nodes and ensure the credibility of the identification results, leading to a decrease in the credibility of the methods. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification. The trust model mainly has the following two core modules: Reputation-based random selection algorithm (RBRSA) and incentive mechanism. By assigning reputation attributes to nodes, the proposed RBRSA will select nodes according to reputation values. RBRSA favors the nodes with high reputation value to ensure the randomness and credibility of the identification nodes. The incentive mechanism is designed to ensure the credibility of the identification results through the credibility analysis of the model based on game theory and Nash equilibrium. Identification nodes that identify illegal data correctly will obtain incentives. In order to obtain a higher income, the identification nodes must identify illegal data correctly. Credibility analysis and comparative experiments show that the probability of selecting credible nodes by RBRSA is up to 23% higher than the random selection algorithm. The probability of selecting the nodes with a reputation value of 20 by RBRSA is 27% lower than the random selection algorithm; that is, the probability that RBRSA selects untrusted nodes is lower. Therefore, the nodes selected by RBRSA have superior credibility compared with other methods. In terms of the effect of the incentive mechanism, the incentive mechanism can encourage nodes to identify data credibly and improve the credibility of identification results. All in all, the trusted model has higher credibility than other methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fog computing is a new computing paradigm that is an extension of the standard cloud computing model, which can be adopted as a cost effective strategy for managing connected objects, by enabling real-time computing and communication for analytical and decision making. Nonetheless, even though Fog-based Internet of Things networks optimize the standard architecture by moving computing, storage, communication, and control decision closer to the edge network, the technology becomes open to malicious attackers and remains many business risks that are not yet resolved. In fact, access control, privacy as well as trust risks present major challenges in Internet of Things environments based on Fog computing due to the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer. In addition, the traditional authentication methods are not adequate in Fog-based Internet of Things contexts since they consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency. To deal with these gaps, we present in this paper a secure and trusted Fog Computing approach based on Blockchain and Identity Federation technologies for a granular access control in IoT environments.

Doing so is trivial if the mechanism is allowed to observe all actions taken in the game, as this allows it to simply punish those agents who deviate from the intended strategy. Instead, we consider an abstraction where the mechanism probabilistically infers information about the outcome of the game. We show that payment schemes can be used to implement any set of utilities if and only if the mechanism can essentially infer completely what happened. We show that finding an optimal payment scheme for games of perfect information is P-complete, and conjecture it to be PPAD-hard for games of imperfect information. We prove a lower bound on the size of the payments, showing that the payments must be linear in the intended level of security. We demonstrate the applicability of our model to concrete problems in distributed computing, namely decentralized commerce and secure multiparty computation, for which the payments match the lower bound asymptotically. © 2022 ACM.},

To make the analysis tractable, we introduce a hybrid approach that includes (i) a light-weight exploration phase that dramatically reduces the number of instructions to analyze, and (ii) a precise refinement phase based on symbolic evaluation guided by our novel value-summary analysis, which generates extra constraints to over-approximate the side effects of whole-program execution, thereby ensuring the precision of the symbolic evaluation. We developed a prototype of SAILFISH and evaluated its ability to detect two state-inconsistency flaws, viz., reentrancy and transaction order dependence (TOD) in Ethereum smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our hybrid approach as well as the benefit of the value summary analysis. In particular, we show that SAILFISH outperforms five state-of the-art smart contract analyzers (SECURIFY, MYTHRIL, OYENTE, SEREUM and VANDAL) in terms of performance, and precision.

Due to the fact that these technologies are self-executing, customized, and impervious to tampering, they are considered to be crucial for the transition to a more efficient, transparent, and transactive payment gateway between major stakeholders. These major stakeholders will be able to communicate through smart contracts, which will act as a bridge between them. As part of their responsibility, they will make sure that all of the terms of the contract are met and acknowledged by all members of the team. As a result of our research, we propose a model in which payouts could be automatically enabled and penalties or grants could be introduced based on performance. If any changes were to be made to the contract in the future, all parties involved would be automatically notified. To maintain the development cycle, they should accept these changes as soon as possible. Because of this, the product owner and client are able to concentrate their resources on more profitable and productive tasks, without the need to monitor this aspect of agile project management.

This paper aims to solve this problem by introducing a peer-to-peer architecture based on blockchain smart contracts. The proposed architecture leverages the automation of smart contracts to provide autonomous, commission-free food ordering and delivery services. In addition, the smart contract reward mechanism is used to collect order information and rating information, and a deep learning recommendation model is introduced to analyze the data to recommend restaurants and menus to the client accurately. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted a case study using public chain-based technologies.

	abstract = {In cross-chain scenarios, there are different blockchains that need cooperation. The cooperation between different blockchains is completed through smart contracts, which jointly complete cross-chain tasks. When numerous cooperative smart contracts are involved, smart contracts form a complex interactive network, which makes it difficult to evaluate the cooperation. A general model is needed to quantitatively analyze the cross-chain cooperation of associated smart contracts. In this paper, we model the cooperation among smart contracts as conditions and their corresponding actions, the quantitative condition-trigger model. Then, a method of calculating trigger probability by using graph weight is proposed. As the edge weight lacks the information of interaction probability, we introduce the dimension of the edge weight to calculate the interaction probability. The results show that the proposed method can effectively analyze the cross-chain cooperation between smart contracts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the growing utility of blockchain technology, the desire for reciprocal interactions among different blockchains is growing. However, most operational blockchain networks currently operate in a standalone setting. This fragmentation in the form of isolated blockchains creates interoperability difficulties, inhibiting the adoption of blockchains in various ecosystems. Interoperability is a key factor in the healthcare domain for sharing EHRs of patients registered in independent blockchain networks. Each blockchain network could have its own rules and regulations, obstructing the exchange of EHRs for improving diagnosis and treatments. Examples include patients being treated by healthcare providers in different countries or regions, or within one country but with a different set of rules per state or emirate. By contrast, a federation of blockchain networks can provide better communication and service to stakeholders in healthcare. Thus, solutions for facilitating inter-blockchain communication in such a blockchain federation are needed. However, this possibility has not been fully explored, and further investigations are still being conducted. Hence, the present study proposes a transaction-based smart contract triggering system for inter-blockchain communication, enabling EHR sharing among independent blockchains. We use local and global smart contracts that will be executed once a transaction is created in the blockchain. Local smart contracts are used for EHR sharing within the blockchain, whereas global smart contracts are used for EHR sharing among independent blockchains. The experimental setup is conducted using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. Inter-blockchain communication between two independent fabric networks is conducted through a global smart contract using Hyperledger Cactus for EHR sharing in a health federation setup. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to implement an inter-blockchain communication model in the healthcare domain. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has had a far-reaching impact on data privacy and compliance for cloud providers. GDPR influences access to, storage, processing and transmission of personal data, requiring these operations to be verified by a cloud user through explicit consent prior to execution. GDPR rules implemented for such operations can be ambiguous and often open to interpretation, making manual verification a time consuming and error prone process for cloud providers. An encoding of GDPR rules is described, with each operation carried out using these rules recorded into a Blockchain for auditing purposes. Specifically, this work shows how some GDPR rules can appear as opcodes in smart contracts to verify the operations of providers on user data in a transparent and automatic way. An abstract model is designed to demonstrate how cloud providers can access and deploy such smart contracts through a Blockchain-based virtual machine. A case study is used to demonstrate how this approach can be used in practice. The case study uses a collection of design patterns and smart contracts to verify provider operations, including read, write, execution and transfer on user data. Validation is undertaken by deploying the smart contracts in a Blockchain test network to investigate the execution costs of GDPR compliance checking. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In a world where organisations are embracing new IT working models such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and remote working, the traditional mindset of defending the network perimeter is no longer sufficient. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has recently emerged as a new security model in which the breach mindset dominates the threat model. By default, the ZTA considers any endpoint (i.e., device), user, or application to be untrusted until proven otherwise. Nonetheless, once proven by the endpoint, using Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), attackers can still take over an authenticated and authorised session via that endpoint. Therefore, they can perform several user/device centric malicious activities in addition to lateral movement rendering the endpoint the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively deter APT attack capabilities on the endpoints, this work proposes a Blockchain-enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (BIDPS) that augments ZTA onto endpoints. The BIDPS aims to achieve two core outcomes: first, detect and prevent attackers' techniques and tactics as per MITRE's ATT&CK enterprise matrix earlier than the lateral movement stage, and secondly, strip trust out of the endpoint itself and place it on-chain, thus creating an immutable system of explicit trust. To evaluate the effectiveness of the BIDPS, a testbed was built where techniques of over ten APTs attacks were launched against the endpoint. BIDPS has a high rate of success defending against the launched attacks owing to its Blockchain's immutability, fortifying the detection/prevention processes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The new IoT apps will not be able to inspire people to utilize them and may ultimately lose all their potential if an interoperable and trustworthy ecosystem is not provided. IoT has its extra security difficulties such as information storage, administration, privacy concerns, and authentication. The presently deployed IoT apps have encountered various security and privacy assaults globally. Due to being less secure and low powered, the IoT devices present a simple entryway to the adversaries to obtain access to the corporate networks, leading to giving easy control over all of the data of the users. The objective of this doctorate proposed work will be to solve the security associated difficulties in multiple IoT domains like the e-commerce, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), and Internet of Drones (IoD). The proposed study focuses on the development of a distributed framework for IoT based on blockchain. The framework includes the usage of Ethereum-based smart contracts and auction models to increase the income and QoS for both the seller and the buyer and the development of a DAG chain-based distributed framework for parking lot allocation in a network of automobiles. The suggested model includes the requirement of obtaining agreement among the nodes with probability one in such a circumstance. The suggested model demonstrates to be predictable as typical voting-based consensus protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and at the same time can accommodate a high number of nodes even in an asynchronous setting. Research on Byzantine fault-tolerant systems has been ongoing for more than four decades, and although the solutions were shown to be feasible early on, they remained unworkable for a long time. With PBFT, the first feasible solution was provided in 1999, and this sparked fresh research that has resulted in unique applications that are still being developed today employing this technology. Despite the fact that the safety and liveness properties of PBFT-type protocols have been thoroughly investigated, when it comes to practical performance, only empirical results - often obtained in artificial environments - are known, and imperfections in the communication channels are not explicitly considered. It is our goal in this paper to propose the first performance model for PBFT that takes into account the effect of unreliable channels as well as the usage of alternative transport protocols across those channels. We also performed a large number of simulations to test the model and acquire a better understanding of the influence of different deployment factors on the total transaction timeframe.  © 2022 D.

	abstract = {Over time, distribution systems have begun to include increased distributed energy resources (DERs) due to the advancement of auxiliary power electronics, information and communication technologies (ICT), and cost reductions. Electric vehicles (EVs) will undoubtedly join the energy community alongside DERs, and energy transfers from vehicles to grids and vice versa will become more extensive in the future. Virtual power plants (VPPs) will also play a key role in integrating these systems and participating in wholesale markets. Energy trading on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis is a promising business model for transactive energy that aids in balancing local supply and demand. Moreover, a market scheme between VPPs can help DER owners make more profit while reducing renewable energy waste. For this purpose, an inter-VPP P2P trading scheme is proposed. The scheme utilizes cutting-edge technologies of the Avalanche blockchain platform, developed from scratch with decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications (DApps), and Web3 workflows in mind. Avalanche is more scalable and has faster transaction finality than its layer-1 predecessors. It provides interoperability abilities among other common blockchain networks, facilitating inter-VPP P2P trading between different blockchain-based VPPs. The merits of DeFi contribute significantly to the workflow in this type of energy trading scenario, as the price mechanism can be determined using open market-like instruments. A detailed case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and flow, and important conclusions were drawn. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The subscription economy was born because the relationship between creators and customers is different than it used to be. The era of the creator economy seems to be filled with boundless promise, but at the end of the day, creators are just slaves to tech giants. Neither the control of the content created, nor the money made in their pockets is in complete control of the creator. The blockchain can completely solve these injustices monopolized by enterprises. In the blockchain era, all kinds of creations from music, and video-to-text can be turned into assets that can be purchased and traded through smart contracts. In the music industry, for example, creators do not need to share profits with streaming platforms and record labels and get all the benefits directly. In addition, when the content created is on the chain, every transaction will be recorded on the blockchain, and everyone can inquire about it, avoiding opacity or causing disputes in the future. However, with the structure of the standard blockchain, as long as the registration is successful, each role in the chain will have permanent data access rights, and the flexibility of access control is poor. Therefore, this study proposes a digital media subscription mechanism based on the Hyperledger blockchain architecture combined with proxy re-encryption. We use symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, smart contracts, and algorithms to design our protocol. When the licensee violates the agreement with the creator, the creator can revoke the access rights to the digital media of the licensee at any time, to realize more secure and convenient digital media transmission. The proposed scheme meets various security requirements of blockchain architecture, and we have also applied the BAN logic proof model to evaluate the correctness of the proposed scheme. This study also proposes an arbitration mechanism when the dispute occurs, and performed well in terms of communication and computational costs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising decentralized deep learning technology, which allows users to update models cooperatively without sharing their data. FL is reshaping existing industry paradigms for mathematical modeling and analysis, enabling an increasing number of industries to build privacy-preserving, secure distributed machine learning models. However, the inherent characteristics of FL have led to problems such as privacy protection, communication cost, systems heterogeneity, and unreliability model upload in actual operation. Interestingly, the integration with Blockchain technology provides an opportunity to further improve the FL security and performance, besides increasing its scope of applications. Therefore, we denote this integration of Blockchain and FL as the Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) framework. This paper introduces an in-depth survey of BCFL and discusses the insights of such a new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce the FL technology and discuss the challenges faced by such technology. Then, we summarize the Blockchain ecosystem. Next, we highlight the structural design and platform of BCFL. Furthermore, we present the attempts ins improving FL performance with Blockchain and several combined applications of incentive mechanisms in FL. Finally, we summarize the industrial application scenarios of BCFL. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Globalisation has facilitated different industries to eliminate geographical boundaries and equipped organisations to work collectively to produce goods. Pharmaceuticals is one such industry which has majorly benefited from globalisation to reduce costs and increase profitability at different aspects of research, development, manufacturing of drugs and finally distribution of drugs. Globalisation not only reduces costs and increases profits for the industry, it also makes essential medication available to all individuals even at remote areas of undeveloped, developing and developed countries. As the number of entities or participants grew in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), the complexity and abstractness of the drug delivery from manufacturer to consumer has increased, which raised new concerns like counterfeit medication, incorrect, incomplete or no information about the drug reaching the consumer thus undermining customer confidence and most importantly distribution delays which can cause serious impact on the life of the consumer as well as business growth. Considering all these challenges, there is a dire need for a robust PSC which can eliminate blind parties and provide a transparent chain. A transparent PSC will eliminate data fragmentation between different participating entities by creating a trail of secure, single source of truth for the entire life cycle of a medicine, thereby eliminating the introduction of counterfeits and ensuring the consumer safety. This article proposes a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent supply chain for PSC and proof-of-concept is implemented to analyse the scalability and efficiency of the proposed architecture. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of the technologies which can provide such transparent PSC and Smart Contracts (SC) are the most commonly used component in such systems to implement business logic and access control mechanisms. The proposed PharmaChain model investigates all the interactions between the main entities in PSC and also addresses smart contract issues such as re-entrance, randomness and lacking trustworthy data feed. Results are compared with other proposed solutions for PSC based on DLT. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM). © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {How to achieve secure content distribution and accountability in information-centric networking (ICN) is a crucial problem. Subscribers need to verify whether the data came from a reliable source, rather than from a spoofing adversary. Public key cryptography was introduced to achieve a method of authentication that binds the data packet to its owner. In existing prototypes, PKIs, identity-based signatures (IBSs) and recommendation networks are the common schemes used to ensure the authenticity and availability of public keys. However, CA-based PKIs and KGC-based IBSs have been proven to be weak when it comes to resisting security attacks, with recommendation networks being too complex to deploy. In this respect, we designed a novel distributed authentication model as a secure scheme to support public key cryptography. Our model establishes a decentralized public key infrastructure by combining the smart contracts of blockchain and optimized zero-knowledge proof-verifiable presentations by utilizing the DID project, which realizes the management of public key certificates through blockchain and ensures the authenticity and availability of public keys in decentralized infrastructure. Our scheme fundamentally solves the issues of security and feasibility in existing schemes and provides a more scalable solution with respect to authenticating data sources. An experiment demonstrated that our proposal is 20% faster than the original zero knowledge proof scheme in registration. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

MVP has an expressive specification language, and is fast and reliable enough that it can be run routinely by developers and in integration testing. Besides the simplicity of smart contracts and the Move language, three implementation approaches are responsible for the practicality of MVP: (1) an alias-free memory model, (2) fine-grained invariant checking, and (3) monomorphization. The entirety of the Move code for the Diem blockchain has been extensively specified and can be completely verified by MVP in a few minutes.

	abstract = {n recent years it has been shown that the secure exchange of medical information significantly benefits people's life quality, improving their care and treatment. The interoperability of the entire healthcare ecosystem is a constant challenge, and even more, with all the risks posed to the security of healthcare information. Blockchain technology is emerging as one of the main alternatives when it comes to finding a balance in the healthcare ecosystem. However, the constant development of new Blockchain technologies and the evolution of healthcare systems make it difficult to find established proposals. From an architectural point of view, the design of blockchain-based solutions requires trade-offs e.g., security and interoperability. This paper focuses on two main objectives, in the first one, it was carried out a Systematic Literature Review for exploring architectural mechanisms used to support the interoperability and security of Blockchain-based Health Management Systems. Taking into account of results, a series of scenarios were generated where these mechanisms can be used along with their context, issues, and various architectural concerns (interoperability and security). In the second objective, a high-level architecture and its validation were proposed through an experiment for the whole process of developing a Domain Specific Language, using the Model Driven Engineering methodology for specific Smart Contracts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides a feasible solution to data outsourcing, and hence forming a cloud-based data market, where data users buy data from owners through querying cloud servers. However, it also incurs new privacy and security problems, as data is under a centralized third-party instead of the data owner's direct control. Existing data markets are also questioned on their inflexible and opaque pricing, where the value of data ownership and the cost of query searches are mixed. In this paper, we consider blockchain-based storage as a better choice to ensure safe data outsourcing since data is spread out across many data points. We propose an Ethereum-based data market that provides distributed storage and correct remote data search. We design a new pricing model, where each query will be charged by two parties: owner (paid for providing his data) and miner (rewarded by performing query searches). We study a new cooperative search scheme through a proxy to reduce cost on the user side. Given that each user query is charged based on its number of keywords, then a cooperative search can reduce user-side cost by combining multiple queries into a group so that overlapped keywords will only be charged for one time. To ensure user QoE, a combined query should not be significantly larger than any of its original queries in terms of the number of keywords. The total price is based on the total number of keywords in all groups. Since it is a cooperative model with shared resources, we also study various incentive properties on the user side, yielding a cost sharing mechanism to split joint cost in a truth-revealing and fair manner. We further extend our market with a set of substitute data owners and propose a double auction mechanism to match users and owners based on their requirements. Experiments have been conducted on real query trace to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its attributes of constrained devices and a distributed environment make it difficult to manage such a huge and growing network of devices on a global scale. Existing traditional access-control systems provide security and management to the IoT system. However, these mechanisms are based on central authority management, which introduces issues such as a single point of failure, low scalability, and a lack of privacy. In order to address these problems, many researchers have proposed using blockchain technology to achieve decentralized access control. However, such models are still faced with problems such as a lack of scalability and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a light-weight hierarchical blockchain-based multi-chaincode access control to protect the security and privacy of IoT systems. A clustering concept with BC managers enables the extended scalability of the proposed system. The architecture of the proposed solution contains three main components: an Edge Blockchain Manager (EBCM), which is responsible for authenticating and authorizing constrained devices locally; an Aggregated Edge Blockchain Manager (AEBCM), which contains various EBCMs to control different clusters and manage ABAC policies, and a Cloud Consortium Blockchain Manager (CCBCM), which ensures that only authorized users access the resources. In our solution, smart contracts are used to self-enforce decentralized AC policies. We implement a proof of concept for our proposed system using the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric. The simulation results and the security analysis show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading platforms envisioned energy sectors to satisfy the increasing demand for energy. The vision of this paper is not only to trade energy but also to have part of it being shared. Therefore, this paper presents FederatedGrids which is a P2P energy trading and sharing platform inside and across microgrids. Energy sharing allows exchanging energy between the categories of consumers and prosumers in return for future benefits. FederatedGrids platform uses blockchain and federated learning to enable autonomous activities while providing trust and privacy among all participants. Indeed, based on various smart contracts using federated learning, FederatedGrids calculates a prediction of the future energy production and demand allowing the system to autonomously switch between trading and sharing, and enabling the prosumers to make decisions related to their participation in the energy sharing process. Up to our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to create a hybrid energy trading and sharing platform, with the real sharing meaning, and that uses federated learning over the smart contract for energy demand prediction. The experimental results showed a 17.8% decrease in energy cost for consumers and a 76.4% decrease in load over utility grids.  © 2017 IEEE.},

Traditional publication systems generally have high publication costs, slow and biased review processes, copyrights held by publishers, lack of rewards for contributors, lack of connection among researchers, etc. Accordingly, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based scientific publication platform to eliminate the traditional publication system deficiencies. The proposed system uses Ethereum smart contracts to accelerate the publication process and abate the biased evaluation process while reducing the publication cost. The proposed model also improves the quality of scientific studies by adding new features to the publication process. The proposed system increases the number of publishers, makes the publication process fully traceable, and makes scientific papers globally available to anyone with a small fee. In addition, the system provides journals with decentralized models and integrates scientific papers with related data or datasets. The editors, reviewers, and cited authors are also rewarded. The proposed system has been implemented using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which consists of a front-end, middleware, and back-end. When an author submits a manuscript for evaluation, the system automatically finds the most appropriate editors and reviewers for related fields. After the publication process finishes, editors, reviewers, cited authors, and other contributors are rewarded as a system token-based cryptocurrency. © 2023 by the authors.},

This paper presents such an approach, which, in combination with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and State machine diagrams, allows the smart contract structure and behavior logic to be modeled in several abstraction layers. This paper delves into details on how the model-to-model transformations from the specified Blockchain Platform Independent Model (PIM) with specified state-like behavior can be used to produce a Solidity Platform Specific Model (PSM). Subsequently, we elaborate on how the Solidity PSM is used for Solidity smart contract code generation by employing model-to-text transformations. The paper also demonstrates the process of our proposed transformations and code generation using smart contract code examples from Solidity documentation. Based on the examples, a Blockchain PIM is specified and transformed to Solidity PSM, which is then used for Solidity smart contract code generation. The generated smart contract code is then compiled, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain JavaScript virtual machine, and compared to the original smart contract code in terms of Solidity code metrics, similarity scores, and execution costs. The evaluation results indicate that our approach could be successfully used to model and later generate smart contract code.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the business barriers that influence cost of implementing unmanned aerial system (UAS) and its suitability for a decentralised system. UAS, or drone, plays a role of data provider to architectural, engineering and construction professionals within a decentralised system. However, the expectations in the execution and test of the effectiveness of the UAS is often not met. The reasons for these fails are not well elaborated in the literature. Hence, the study investigates the barriers and cost analysis of UAS that can be used for a decentralised case, in which the UAS data are useful for multiple stakeholders, and provide illustration of the interactions within this approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is part of a longitudinal project by using a qualitative method of interviewing 24 participants involved in the process of application of drones in the country of the Dominican Republic. The open-ended semi-structured interviews were composed for questions regarding the application of UAS, barriers and business implications. The data gathered were transcribed and used thematic analysis for its interpretation. Later, conclusions of the barriers of UAS implementation in the organisation were analysed and a cost model was developed to identify a viable scenario. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the barriers and economic considerations faced in the implementation process of UAS. In this research, 16 barriers in the implementation process at the management level, 8 types of cases of business relationships and 13 business models were identified. Furthermore, recommendations were made about being the accountability of the dimensions and recurrent visits to the projects handled by the portfolio of the organisations. Research limitations/implications: Blockchain system is supported by UAS data and its tests require skills and resources that were outside of the scope of the main research intend regarding UAS implementation in construction. Furthermore, as these technologies are still under development, the assessment of the decentralised system, smart contract and swarm technology was addressed conceptually and further research are encouraged in this field. Practical implications: The paper includes barriers to consider before implementation, business implications, project examples and cost structure developed. Furthermore, the findings are fit theoretically into the context of a decentralised system. It was understood and contemplated that monitoring in open and outdoor spaces is the suitable approach for UAS implementations for decentralised system. The trend of decentralised autonomous organisations for transparency and efficiency of human tasks provides the foundations of human–robot interactions as well as the role of tokenisation of assets into the cyberspace. Therefore, the paper brings managers and technicians the implications for the future-proofing the implementation of UAS. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of the implications of cost and the suitable scenarios for return of investment in the UAS implementation in the current stage of the technology development. In addition, the paper makes reference to decentralised systems, smart contracts and swarm technology as options in which reality capture technologies are essential for construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has exposed the privacy of positive patients to the public, which will lead to violations of users’ rights and even threaten their lives. A privacy-preserving scheme involving virus-infected positive patients is proposed by us. The traditional ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has the features of enhanced plaintext security and fine-grained access control. However, the encryption process requires the high computational performance of the device, which puts a high strain on resource-limited devices. After semi-honest users successfully decrypt the data, they will get the real private data, which will cause serious privacy leakage problems. Traditional cloud-based data management architectures are extremely vulnerable in the face of various cyberattacks. To address the above challenges, a verifiable ABE scheme based on blockchain and local differential privacy is proposed, using LDP to perturb the original data locally to a certain extent to resist collusion attacks, outsourcing encryption and decryption to corresponding service providers to reduce the pressure on mobile terminals, and deploying smart contracts in combination with blockchain for fair execution by all parties to solve the problem of returning wrong search results in a semi-honest cloud server. Detailed security proofs are performed through the defined security goals, which shows that the proposed scheme is indeed privacy-protective. The experimental results show that the scheme is optimized in terms of data accuracy, computational overhead, storage performance, and fairness. In terms of efficiency, it greatly reduces the local load, enhances personal privacy protection, and has high practicality as well as reliability. As far as we know, it is the first case of applying the combination of LDP technology and blockchain to a tracing system, which not only mitigates poisoning attacks on user data, but also improves the accuracy of the data, thus making it easier to identify infected contacts and making a useful contribution to health prevention and control efforts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has widely expanded due to its advantages in enhancing the business, industrial, and social ecosystems. Nevertheless, IoT infrastructure is susceptible to several cyber-attacks due to the endpoint devices’ restrictions in computation, storage, and communication capacity. As such, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the security of the IoT. Attackers can easily utilize IoT devices as part of botnets to launch DDoS attacks by taking advantage of their flaws. This paper proposes an Ethereum blockchain model to detect and prevent DDoS attacks against IoT systems. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to resolve the single points of failure (dependencies on third parties) and privacy and security in IoT systems. First, we propose implementing a decentralized platform in place of current centralized system solutions to prevent DDoS attacks on IoT devices at the application layer by authenticating and verifying these devices. Second, we suggest tracing and recording the IP address of malicious devices inside the blockchain to prevent them from connecting and communicating with the IoT networks. The system performance has been evaluated by performing 100 experiments to evaluate the time taken by the authentication process. The proposed system highlights two messages with a time of 0.012 ms: the first is the request transmitted from the IoT follower device to join the blockchain, and the second is the blockchain response. The experimental evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our system because there are fewer I/O operations in the proposed system than in other related works, and thus it runs substantially faster. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Because of the rise of cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps, blockchain technology has generated a lot of interest. Among these is the emergent blockchain-based crowdsourcing paradigm, which eliminates the centralized conventional mechanism servers in favor of smart contracts for task and reward allocation. However, there are a few crucial challenges that must be resolved properly. For starters, most reputation-based systems favor high-performing employees. Secondly, the crowdsourcing platform’s expensive service charges may obstruct the growth of crowdsourcing. Finally, unequal evaluation and reward allocation might lead to job dissatisfaction. As a result, the aforementioned issues will substantially impede the development of blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems. In this study, we introduce ExCrowd, a blockchain-based crowdsourcing system that employs a smart contract as a trustworthy authority to properly select workers, assess inputs, and award incentives while maintaining user privacy. Exploration-based crowdsourcing employs the hyperbolic learning curve model based on the conduct of workers and analyzes worker performance patterns using a decision tree technique. We specifically present the architecture of our framework, on which we establish a concrete scheme. Using a real-world dataset, we implement our model on the Ethereum public test network leveraging its reliability, adaptability, scalability, and rich statefulness. The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficiency, usefulness, and adaptability of our proposed system. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business processes can be seen as smart contracts, as they are oftentimes adopted to express agreements among different organizations. Indeed, they provide mechanisms to formalize the obligations of each involved party. For instance, collaborative business processes can specify when a certain task should be executed, under which conditions a service should be offered to the other participants, and how physical objects and information should be manipulated. In this setting, to prevent misuse of smart contracts and services and information provided, it is paramount to guarantee by design that security requirements are fulfilled. With the rise in popularity of blockchains, several approaches exploiting the trusted smart contract execution environment offered by this technology to enforce collaborative business processes have been proposed. Yet, the complexity of business processes, security requirements, and blockchain applications calls for an engineering approach that guides the design of secure business processes. Such an approach should both take advantage of the possibilities offered by blockchain technology to enforce some security requirements (e.g., non-repudiation), and take into account the limitations blockchain poses for other security requirements (e.g., confidentiality). However, we are not aware of any existing work that aims at addressing such issues following a similar approach. In this article, we propose SecBPMN2BC: a model-driven approach to designing business processes with security requirements that are meant to be deployed on blockchains. SecBPMN2BC consists of: (i) an extension of BPMN 2.0 that allows designing secure smart contracts; (ii) a set of algorithms and their implementation that check incompatible security requirements and help the design of smart contracts; (iii) a workflow that guides the application of the method. The method has been validated with a survey conducted on security and BPMN experts. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Federated learning enables multiple users to collaboratively train a global model using the users’ private data on users’ local machines. This way, users are not required to share their training data with other parties, maintaining user privacy; however, the vanilla federated learning proposal is mainly assumed to be run in a trusted environment, while the actual implementation of federated learning is expected to be performed in untrusted domains. This paper aims to use blockchain as a trusted federated learning platform to realize the missing “running on untrusted domain” requirement. First, we investigate vanilla federate learning issues such as client’s low motivation, client dropouts, model poisoning, model stealing, and unauthorized access. From those issues, we design building block solutions such as incentive mechanism, reputation system, peer-reviewed model, commitment hash, and model encryption. We then construct the full-fledged blockchain-based federated learning protocol, including client registration, training, aggregation, and reward distribution. Our evaluations show that the proposed solutions made federated learning more reliable. Moreover, the proposed system can motivate participants to be honest and perform best-effort training to obtain higher rewards while punishing malicious behaviors. Hence, running federated learning in an untrusted environment becomes possible. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In order to promote the value circulation of energy resources and improve energy efficiency, credible energy sharing between Internet of Things Devices (IoTDs) came into being. However, sometimes IoTDs do not obtain the required energy in the required time period, resulting in less active participation in energy sharing. To address these challenges, this paper first proposes a credible energy transaction model based on the distributed ledger blockchain at the Edge of the Internet of Things, where the Edge Cloud Server (ECS) can collect a large number of surplus energy resources of IoTDs in a secure and credible energy sharing environment and share them with other IoTDs in urgent need of charging. Meanwhile, in order to attract IoTDs to participate in energy sharing for a long time and meet the energy demand of ECS to the maximum extent, a smart contract-based Expected Social Welfare Maximized double auction incentive mechanism of Single ECS to Multi-IoTDs (ESWM-StM) is proposed to enable dynamic and adaptive energy sharing from multiple IoTDs to a single ECS. In addition, this paper compares the proposed algorithm with the benchmark method in terms of energy-sharing cost and long-term utility. The simulation results show that the proposed incentive mechanism can enable IoTDs to provide more surplus energy per unit cost to meet the energy demand of ECSs, and can sustainably attract more energy trading participants to enhance the expected social welfare in the long term. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Historically, threat information sharing has relied on manual modelling and centralised network systems, which can be inefficient, insecure, and prone to errors. Alternatively, private blockchains are now widely used to address these issues and improve overall organisational security. An organisation’s vulnerabilities to attacks might change over time. It is utterly important to find a balance among a current threat, the potential countermeasures, their consequences and costs, and the estimation of the overall risk that this provides to the organisation. For enhancing organisational security and automation, applying threat intelligence technology is critical for detecting, classifying, analysing, and sharing new cyberattack tactics. Trusted partner organisations can then share newly identified threats to improve their defensive capabilities against unknown attacks. On this basis, organisations can help reduce the risk of a cyberattack by providing access to past and current cybersecurity events through blockchain smart contracts and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The suggested combination of technologies can make organisational systems more reliable and secure, improving system automation and data quality. This paper outlines a privacy-preserving mechanism for threat information sharing in a trusted way. It proposes a reliable and secure architecture for data automation, quality, and traceability based on the Hyperledger Fabric private-permissioned distributed ledger technology and the MITRE ATT&CK threat intelligence framework. This methodology can also be applied to combat intellectual property theft and industrial espionage. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a blockchain-based P2P energy trading platform, where prosumers can trade energy autonomously with no central authority interference. Multiple prosumers can collaborate in producing energy to form a single provider. Clients’ power consumption is monitored using a smart meter that interfaces with an IoT node connected to a blockchain private network. The smart contracts, invoked on the blockchain, enable the autonomous trading interactions between parties and govern accounts behavior within the Ethereum state. The decentralized P2P trading platform utilizes autonomous pay-per-use billing and energy routing, monitored by a smart contract. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) deep learning-based model, predicts future consumption based on past data aggregated to the blockchain. Predictions are then used to set Time of Use (ToU) ranges using the K-mean clustering. The data used to train the GRU model are shared between all parties within the network, making the predictions transparent and verifiable. Implementing the K-mean clustering in a smart contract on the blockchain allows the set of ToU to be independent and incontestable. To secure the validity of the data uploaded to the blockchain, a consensus algorithm is suggested to detect fraudulent nodes along with a Proof of Location (PoL), ensuring that the data are uploaded from the expected nodes. The paper explains the proposed platform architecture, functioning as well as implementation in vivid details. Results are presented in terms of smart contract gas consumption and transaction latency under different loads. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Secondly, taking the high accuracy of dynamic detection and the high efficiency of static detection into consideration, we propose a chaincode vulnerability detection framework that combines the dynamic symbolic execution and the static abstract syntax tree analysis technology. We also implement a supporting-tool that can detect the above 15 types of vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the tool by 15 chaincodes collected from GitHub and unknown vulnerabilities were detected in 13 projects. The precision turned out to be 91% after manual inspection. In order to verify the recall rate, we manually inject 30 vulnerabilities into the collected chaincodes and all of them are detected. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the proposed vulnerability detection method for Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts. © 2022 ACM.},

Incorporating other advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), or e-Health systems, has made ML the first choice to help automate systems and predict future events. The execution environment of ML is always presenting contrasting types of threats, such as adversarial poisoning of training datasets or model parameters manipulation. Blockchain technology is known as a decentralized network of blocks that symbolizes means of protecting block content integrity and ensuring secure execution of operations.Existing studies partially incorporated Blockchain into the learning process. This paper proposes a more extensive secure way to protect the decision process of the learning model. Using smart contracts, this study executed the model’s decision by the reversal engineering of the learning model’s decision function from the extracted learning parameters. We deploy Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers decision functions on-chain for more comprehensive integration of Blockchain. The effectiveness of this proposed approach is measured by applying a case study of medical records. In a safe environment, SVM prediction scores were found to be higher than MLP. However, MLP had higher time efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Most countries in the world are currently faced with a series of public procurement challenges. Moreover, the large volumes of public procurement and the impact it may have of the global economy, the environment and the society at large justify a research study aimed at achieving sustainable and smart procurement. Smart public procurement intensively relies on emerging technologies and it is both an international priority and a challenge to achieve it. This paper is aimed at addressing such procurement-specific challenges. This study reflects the current status and the trends in public procurement, as well as the manner in which Blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIoT) may lead to a beneficial change in the field. In order to analyse the impact of BIoT, we are putting forward an assessment model comprising the definition and the description of six hypotheses. They are validated both by reference to the current knowledge status and via the analysis of the data collected in a survey which was conducted in Romania. It was aimed at collecting and analysing the data from the main stakeholders as well as at formulating recommendations/actions related to the modernisation of the current system. The study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the proposed model and to establish the relationships between the adoption of BIoT and smart, sustainable and transparent public procurement. At the same time, we analyse the links between the adoption of BIoT and aspects such as corruption and fraud, the challenges related to technological integration and the need to reengineer organisations, as well as national and international policies. Following our analyses, there emerged that BIoT adoption has a positive impact on the achievement of sustainable public procurement processes (the highest effect), on transparency and the trust in public procurement, on reducing corruption and fraud in public procurement and on the achievement of smart public procurement. The paper provides theoretical and practical contributions that should support solutions to the current major challenges and represent a vehicle for innovation and sustainable development alike.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A smart contract, as an important part of blockchain technology, has attracted considerable interest from both industry and academia. It provides the basis for the realization of a variety of practical blockchain applications and plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. While it also holds a large number of digital assets, the frequent occurrence of smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge economic losses and destroyed the blockchain-based credit system. Currently, the security and reliability of smart contracts have become a new focus of research, and there are a number of smart contract vulnerability detection methods, such as traditional detection tools based on static or dynamic analysis. However, most of them often rely on expert rules, and therefore have poor scalability and high false negative and false positive rates. Recent deep learning methods alleviate this issue, but without considering the semantic information and context of source code. To this end, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism (HAM) model to detect security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We extract code fragments from the source code, which focus on key points of vulnerability. We conduct extensive experiments on two public smart contract datasets (a total of 24,957 contracts). Empirical results show remarkable accuracy improvement over the state-of-the art methods on five kinds of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy could achieve 93.36%, 80.85%, 82.56%, 85.62%, and 82.19% for reentrancy, arithmetic vulnerability, unchecked return value, timestamp dependency, and tx.origin, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Financial fraud cases are on the rise even with the current technological advancements. Due to the lack of inter-organization synergy and because of privacy concerns, authentic financial transaction data is rarely available. On the other hand, data-driven technologies like machine learning need authentic data to perform precisely in real-world systems. This study proposes a blockchain and smart contract-based approach to achieve robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for e-commerce fraud detection by facilitating inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to secure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network fully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from collaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain. To incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism that is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations receive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A mining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally, the blockchain network is tested under different difficulty levels and under different volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93% testing accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight incremental updates. Our experiment shows that both data volume and difficulty level of blockchain impacts the mining time. For difficulty level less than five, mining time and difficulty level has a positive correlation. For difficulty level two and three, less than a second is required to mine a block in our system. Difficulty level five poses much more difficulties to mine the blocks.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has proved its applicability in numerous domains such as healthcare, agriculture, automobile, industrial production, logistics and supply chain management. Looking at the current trend, we expect massive proliferation of such IoT devices all around us. However, one of the issues with the widespread use of IoT is the increasing complexity of the underlying architecture, which lead to difficulty in ensuring security compliance. One of the critical security processes is key refreshment, which needs to be regularly executed in order to guarantee strong security management. However, in most of the cases, keys are not updated and if they are updated, the update-logs are not available for all the entities to verify and build trust. Furthermore, the rules for key refreshment are also not defined in a transparent way. In this paper, we propose secure, decentralized, and automatic key refreshment mechanism for an IoT system. The proposed mechanism enables users to verify the freshness of the security keys (being used) thereby relying on the data from IoT devices and establishing trust in an IoT system. The proposed mechanism is driven by blockchain technology and smart contract. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution we have implemented it using both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchains. Author},

Further, a sensing network and connectivity model is proposed to detect true fire and send an emergency service request to monitoring station. Smart contracts are designed to automate fire brigade service and insurance claim processes.

	abstract = {In agriculture supply chain management, traceability is a crucial aspect to ensure food safety for increasing customer loyalty and satisfaction. Lack of quality assurance in centralized data storage makes us move towards a new approach based on a decentralized system in which transparency and quality assurance is guaranteed throughout the supply chain from producer to consumer. The current supply chain model has some disadvantages like a communication gap between the entities of the supply chain and no information about the travel history and origin of the product. The use of technology improves the communication and relation between various farmers and stakeholders. Blockchain technology acquires transparency and traceability in the supply chain, provides transaction records traceability, and enhances security for the whole supply chain. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based, fully decentralized traceability model that ensures the integrity and transparency of the system. This new model eliminated most of the disadvantages of the traditional supply chain. For the coordination of all transactions in the supply chain, we proposed a decentralized supply chain model along with a smart contract. © 2022 Ibtisam Ehsan et al.},

	abstract = {The centralized storage and centralized authorization approach in medical information systems can lead to data tampering and private information privacy leakage, while the traditional access control model has an overly simple authentication approach, relies excessively on trusted third-party organizations for the enforcement of access control policies, and has low efficiency in processing access requests. To address these problems, this paper proposes an access control model based on the collaboration of blockchain main and side chains, AC-BMS. Firstly, a password-based authentication scheme is designed based on doctors’ identity information; then Polygon side chain is designed to enhance the storage scalability of the blockchain; finally, the access node information on the main Ethereum chain is located on the side chain, and resources are obtained by executing Roll-up contracts deployed on the side chain. It is confirmed by simulation experiments in Hyperledger Fabric that the access efficiency and throughput of the blockchain access model proposed in this paper are improved when the number of accesses is multiplied, the average access time is saved by 2–3 s, the latency time is floating and stable, and the security, scalability, and availability are enhanced. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The increase in the interconnection of physical devices and the emergence of the 5 G paradigm foster the generation and distribution of massive amounts of data. The complexity associated with the management of these data requires a suitable access control approach that empowers citizens to control how their data are shared, so potential privacy issues can be mitigated. While well-known access control models are widely used in web and cloud scenarios, the IoT ecosystem needs to address the requirements of lightness, decentralization, and scalability to control the access to data generated by a huge number of heterogeneous devices. This work proposes CapBlock, a design that integrates a capability-based access control model and blockchain technology for a fully distributed evaluation of authorization policies and generation of access credentials using smart contracts. CapBlock is intended to manage the access to information in federated IoT environments where data need to be managed through access control policies defined by different data providers. The feasibility of CapBlock has been successfully evaluated in the scope of the EU research project IoTCrawler, which aims at building a secure search engine for IoT data in large-scale scenarios.  © 2022 Hien Truong et al.},

	abstract = {Current traditional shipping models are increasingly revealing many shortcomings and affecting the interests of sellers and buyers due to having to depend on trusted third parties. For example, the Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) model must depend on the carrier/shipper, or the Letter-of-Credit (LoC) model depends on the place of the Letter certification (i.e., bank). There have been many examples demonstrating the riskiness of the two models above. Specifically, in developing countries (e.g., Vietnam), the demand for exporting goods and trading between sellers and buyers have not yet applied the benefits of current technology to improve traditional shipping models. Two typical examples in the last five years that have demonstrated the risks of both sellers and buyers when applying CoD and LoC models are the problem of keeping the money of the seller of GNN Expresses (2017) as well as risks in losing control of 4 containers of cashew nuts when exporting from Vietnam to Italy (2021). A series of studies have proposed solutions based on distributed storage, blockchain, and smart contracts to solve the above problems. However, the role of the shipper has not been considered in some approaches or is not suitable for deployment in a developed country (i.e., Vietnam). In this paper, we propose a combination model between the traditional CoD model and blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFT to solve the above problems. Specifically, our contribution includes four aspects: a) proposing a shipping model based on blockchain technology and smart contracts; b) proposing a model for storing package information based on Ethereum’s NFT technology (i.e. ERC721); c) implementing the proposed model by designing smart contracts that support the creation and transfer of NFTs between sellers and buyers; d) deploy smart contracts on four EVM-enabled platforms including BNB Smart chain, Fantom, Celo, and Polygon to find a suitable platform for the proposed model. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

	abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has risen to prominence as a possible backbone in the health sector, with the ability to improve quality of life by broadening user experience while enabling crucial solutions such as near real-time remote diagnostics. However, privacy and security problems remain largely unresolved in the safety area. Various rule-based methods have been considered to recognize aberrant behaviors in IoMT and have demonstrated high accuracy of misbehavior detection appropriate for lightweight IoT devices. However, most of these solutions have privacy concerns, especially when giving context during misbehavior analysis. Moreover, falsified or modified context generates a high percentage of false positives and sometimes causes a by-pass in misbehavior detection. Relying on the recent powerful consolidation of blockchain and federated learning (FL), we propose an efficient privacy-preserving framework for secure misbehavior detection in lightweight IoMT devices, particularly in the artificial pancreas system (APS). The proposed approach employs privacy-preserving bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and augments the security through integrating blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart contract environment. The effectiveness of the proposed model is bench-marked empirically in terms of sustainable privacy preservation, commensurate incentive scheme with an untraceability feature, exhaustiveness, and the compact results of a variant neural network approach. As a result, the proposed model has a 99.93% recall rate, showing that it can detect virtually all possible malicious events in the targeted use case. Furthermore, given an initial ether value of 100, the solution's average gas consumption and Ether spent are 84,456.5 and 0.03157625, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.},

It is decentralized, tamper-proof, traceable and protects the privacy of users to a certain extent. We implement this crowdsourcing design system on a specific blockchain test network to experiment and test its functionalities.

	abstract = {Programming errors enable security attacks on smart contracts, which are used to manage large sums of financial assets. Automated program repair (APR) techniques aim to reduce developers' burden of manually fixing bugs by automatically generating patches for a given issue. Existing APR tools for smart contracts focus on mitigating typical smart contract vulnerabilities rather than violations of functional specification. However, in decentralized financial (DeFi) smart contracts, the inconsistency between intended behavior and implementation translates into the deviation from the underlying financial model, resulting in monetary losses for the application and its users. In this work, we propose DeFinery - a technique for automated repair of a smart contract that does not satisfy a user-defined correctness property. To explore a larger set of diverse patches while providing formal correctness guarantees w.r.t. the intended behavior, we combine search-based patch generation with semantic analysis of an original program for inferring its specification. Our experiments in repairing 9 real-world and benchmark smart contracts prove that DeFinery efficiently generates high-quality patches that cannot be found by other existing tools.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Smart contract transactions are increasingly interleaved by cross-contract calls. While many tools have been developed to identify a common set of vulnerabilities, the cross-contract vulnerability is overlooked by existing tools. Cross-contract vulnerabilities are exploitable bugs that manifest in the presence of more than two interacting contracts. Existing methods are however limited to analyze a maximum of two contracts at the same time. Detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities is highly non-trivial. With multiple interacting contracts, the search space is much larger than that of a single contract. To address this problem, we present <sc>xFuzz</sc>, a machine learning guided smart contract fuzzing framework. The machine learning models are trained with novel features (e.g., word vectors and instructions) and are used to filter likely benign program paths. Comparing with existing static tools, machine learning model is proven to be more robust, avoiding directly adopting manually-defined rules in specific tools. We compare <sc>xFuzz</sc> with three state-of-the-art tools on 7,391 contracts. <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects 18 exploitable cross-contract vulnerabilities, of which 15 vulnerabilities are exposed for the first time. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be efficient in detecting non-cross-contract vulnerabilities as well&#x2014;using less than 20&#x0025; time as that of other fuzzing tools, <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects twice as many vulnerabilities.

A total 77.44% improvement is registered during performance evaluation over a scalable environment. The performance evaluation of each case study and collaborative performance evaluation concludes the improvised performance of the proposed solution for scalable and distributed applications.

In this way, the nontampering, auditability, and verifiability of the access control information are guaranteed; then, the access control method based on smart contracts is adopted to realize the user-driven, whole-process transparent, and dynamic and automatic access control of big data resources. The simulation results show that the greater the ratio of n/k, the better the optimization effect, and the greater the ratio, the lower the corresponding misjudgment rate, but it will also take up more space costs. At the same time, the true value of the false positive rate is generally less than the theoretical value of the false positive rate. When the performance of Hash (strategy to retrieve) is better, the result of Hash distribution is more uniform. Under the condition of m = 3, the misjudgment rate acceptable for the expected use can be achieved, and the increase in the number of Hashes will not bring a significant increase in revenue. Freed from the traditional model of providing access control services based on third parties, solve the problem of transparency of authority judgments; at the same time, through smart contracts, based on the strategy published by the resource owner on the blockchain, realize automatic access control to big data resources; and make the judicial process more flexible and the judgment result more credible. The BBAC-BD mechanism realizes a safe, reliable, and transparent new access control architecture, and it can effectively promote the safe circulation and sharing of big data. © 2022 Nan Zhao et al.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of cryptocurrencies and the remarkable development of blockchain technology, decentralized applications emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Meanwhile, decentralized applications have also attracted intense attention from the online gambling community, with more and more decentralized gambling platforms created through the help of smart contracts. Compared with conventional gambling platforms, decentralized gambling has transparent rules and a low participation threshold, attracting a substantial number of gamblers. In order to discover gambling behaviors and identify the contracts and addresses involved in gambling, we propose a tool termed ETHGamDet. The tool is able to automatically detect the smart contracts and addresses involved in gambling by scrutinizing the smart contract code and address transaction records. Interestingly, we present a novel LightGBM model with memory components, which possesses the ability to learn from its own misclassifications. As a side contribution, we construct and release a large-scale gambling dataset at https://github.com/AwesomeHuang/Bitcoin-Gambling-Dataset to facilitate future research in this field. Empirically, ETHGamDet achieves a F1-score of 0.72 and 0.89 in address classification and contract classification respectively, and offers novel and interesting insights. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Detecting malicious activity in advance has become increasingly important for public safety, economic stability, and national security. However, the disparity in living standards incites the minds of certain undesirable members of society to commit crimes, which may disrupt society’s stability and mental calm. Breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) make it feasible to address such challenges and construct a complete intelligent framework that automatically detects such malicious behaviors. Motivated by this, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Xception model, i.e., BlockCrime, to detect crimes and improve public safety. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to securely store the detected crime scene locations and alert the nearest law enforcement authorities. Due to the scarcity of the dataset, transfer learning has been preferred, in which a CNN-based Xception model is used. The redesigned Xception architecture is evaluated against various assessment measures, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall, where it outperforms existing CNN architectures in terms of train accuracy, i.e., 96.57%. © 2022 by the authors.},

Blockchain (BC) is one of the technologies that has been introduced worldwide in recent years. It has been beneficial for the tourism industry, in addition to many other sectors. This article investigates the advantages and disadvantages of BC adoption in the tourism industry, as well as the possible solutions to overcome the challenges. This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) that consists of the operations for detecting, selecting, categorizing, and analyzing relevant articles on a specified subject. It is evident from the results that the majority of the academic works illustrate the benefits of BC implementation and explain its potential by providing diverse models of BC-based systems. However, since BC is a young technology, numerous challenges have appeared on the path to its full adoption in the tourism industry. Possible solutions are the achievement of a collaborative approach among the stakeholders, the deepening of academic research in the field, testing more models of BC-based systems, and the establishment of relevant policies. Consequently, the implications for the theory, practice, policy, and research of this work are significant. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Cloud integration advances the capabilities of manufacturing systems with cloud-based controlling and real-time process monitoring, which is renowned as cloud manufacturing (CM). However, cloud integration exposes the entire manufacturing ecosystem to a new set of security risks and increments in end-to-end latency. Moving security services toward the edge eradicates message routing latency toward the cloud and eliminates the central point of failure while leveraging the entire system's performance. We propose a blockchain and fog-computing-enabled security service architecture that operates on fog nodes at the edge of manufacturing equipment clusters. The proposed service facilitates CM equipment authentication and equipment-cloud channel privacy protection while preserving anonymity and unlinkability over the blockchain.

Cryptocurrency has become a new and attractive means of remittance. Thus, blockchain-based smart contracts also attract attention when central banks design digital currencies. However, it has been discovered that a significant amount of cryptoassets on blockchain are lost or stranded for a variety of reasons, including the loss of the private key or the owner's death. To address this issue, we propose a method for recoverable transactions that would replace the traditional transaction by allowing cryptoassets to be sent to a backup account address after a deadline has passed. We provide the computational workload required for our method by analyzing the prototype.

Lack of trust of the mechanism is the main factor in restricting the development of port supply chains. Blockchains have great potential to solve the trust problem among all participants using port supply chains, which can reduce costs and improve efficiency. As the bridge between blockchains and port supply chains, smart contracts reconstruct the business process of blockchain‐empowered port supply chains. In this article, we present an architecture of a consortium blockchain‐empow-ered port supply chain system, and propose a system verification framework for the smart contracts of port supply chains with probabilistic behaviors. The smart contracts are modeled as DTMCs (Dis-crete‐Time Markov Chains), which are automatically transformed through the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) description of the smart contracts. The requirements are specified by PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic). Moreover, we implement the customs clearance process of the Shanghai Yangshan Port based on blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, and reconstruct the clearance process with smart contracts. We use it to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, and identify the smart contracts that do not meet the expected needs of users. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely and rapidly used to automate financial and business transactions together with blockchains, helping people make agreements while minimizing trusts. With millions of smart contracts deployed on blockchain, various bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have emerged. Following the rapid development of deep learning, many recent studies have used deep learning for vulnerability detection to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. These approaches show effective results on detecting whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not whereas their results on locating suspicious statements responsible for the detected vulnerability are still unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning based two-phase smart contract debugger for reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe vulnerabilities, named as ReVulDL: Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection and Localization. ReVulDL integrates the vulnerability detection and localization into a unified debugging pipeline. For the detection phase, given a smart contract, ReVulDL uses a graph-based pre-training model to learn the complex relationships in propagation chains for detecting whether the smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability. For the localization phase, if a reentrancy vulnerability is detected, ReVulDL utilizes interpretable machine learning to locate the suspicious statements in smart contract to provide interpretations of the detected vulnerability. Our large-scale empirical study on 47,398 smart contracts shows that ReVulDL achieves promising results in detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities (e.g., outperforming 16 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches) and locating vulnerable statements (e.g., 70.38% of the vulnerable statements are ranked within Top-10).  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, smart medical cloud platforms have become a new direction in the industry. However, because the medical system involves personal physiological data, user privacy in data transmission and processing is also easy to leak in the smart medical cloud platform. This paper proposed a medical data privacy preserving framework named PMHE based on blockchain and fully homomorphic encryption technology. The framework receives personal physiological data from wearable devices on the client side, and uses blockchain as data storage to ensure that the data cannot be tampered with or forged; Besides, it uses fully homomorphic encryption method to design disease prediction models implemented by smart contracts. In PMHE, data is encoded and encrypted on the client side, and encrypted data is uploaded to the cloud platform via the public Internet, preventing privacy leakage caused by channel eavesdropping; smart contracts run on the blockchain platform for disease prediction, and the operators participating in computing are encrypted user data too. So, privacy and security issues caused by platform data leakage are avoided. The client-to-cloud interaction protocol is also designed to overcome the defect that fully homomorphic encryption only supports addition and multiplication by submitting tuples on the client side, to ensure that the prediction model can perform complex computing. In addition, the design of the smart contract is introduced in detail, and the performance of the system is analyzed. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the operating effect of the system, ensuring that user privacy is not leaked without affecting the accuracy of the model, and realizing a smart medical cloud platform in which data can be used but cannot be borrowed. © 2022, The Author(s).},

It integrates smart contracts, data-embedding technology, and data fingerprint to realize ownership confirmation and protection of data assets in transactions. DOCS ensures reliable mapping between on-chain data ownership information and off-chain data entities, which assists with the accurate prosecution of the illegal distribution of data assets.

	abstract = {In the last two years, due to the pandemic and restrictive measures, the dependence of music creators and artists on the Internet, where they could promote their work, organize live streaming concerts, and talk to the public, has increased and expanded even more and seeks higher revenue from digital music platforms. An important issue that arises from the above statement is protecting the authors' copyright regarding the uses and sharing in the digital services of their works with protected content. Although circulated in digital information, the protected content is not information but a product of ethical and commercial value. While it has an intangible owner and it owes its existence to the creative idea of its creator, it is not an idea. The imposition of legal and commercial conditions on its movement cannot be associated with any restrictions on the free movement of information, as it is not related to them. In general, the unauthorized exchange of digital music files via peer-to-peer violates copyright law. The exchange of files is unauthorized, as it does not have the relevant permission from the creators and beneficiaries and is therefore illegal. With this in mind, this paper proposes a highly effective way of protecting the copyright of music technology, which is based on the widespread use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptography technologies. Specifically, an advanced blockchain model based on Hyperledger Fabric is introduced, which, however, uses Quantum Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Zero-Knowledge Arguments. Music files are implemented as Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs), which activate smart contracts. Finally, an advanced collaborative filtering algorithm provides recommendations for effectiveness in securing the copyrights of music industry creators. A specialized scenario was built to model the proposed system to verify the degree of protection on music intellectual property in developing a security simulation with an innovative consensus-based zero knowledge and the quantum fully homomorphic encryption technique. Experiment results show that this technique can aid in implementing a technologically aware system capable of providing a powerful answer to a current real-world problem.  © 2022 Na Li.},

	abstract = {A rich ecosystem of blockchain-based projects has emerged since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. New protocols seek to improve the performances of blockchain systems. In particular, the energy consumption of blockchains has been particularly decried. Unfortunately, those new proposals are often evaluated with ad hoc tools and experimental environments. Therefore, reproducibility and comparison of these new contributions with the state of the art of blockchain technologies are complicated. To the best of our knowledge, only a few tools partially address the design of a generic benchmarking of blockchain technologies (e.g., load generation). This paper introduces BCTMark, a generic framework for benchmarking blockchain technologies on an emulated network in a reproducible way. Based on this novel framework, we studied a key aspect of modern blockchains’ energy consumption: smart-contract execution. Based on experiments and the analysis of one year of real-world Ethereum transactions, we measured and modeled smart-contracts’ energy consumption on Ethereum. Furthermore, this study details how the replication of contract calls execution can impact their energy cost. In particular, we give insights on the energy consumed by smart-contracts on Ethereum over one year. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the healthcare industry has continuously grown, with hundreds of thousands of patients obtaining treatment remotely using smart devices. Data security becomes a prime concern with such a massive increase in the number of patients. Numerous attacks on healthcare data have recently been identified that can put the patient’s identity at stake. For example, the private data of millions of patients have been published online, posing a severe risk to patients’ data privacy. However, with the advent of Industry 4.0, medical practitioners can digitally assess the patient’s condition and administer prompt prescriptions. However, wearable devices are also vulnerable to numerous security threats, such as session hijacking, data manipulation, and spoofing attacks. Attackers can tamper with the patient’s wearable device and relays the tampered data to the concerned doctor. This can put the patient’s life at high risk. Since blockchain is a transparent and immutable decentralized system, it can be utilized for securely storing patient’s wearable data. Artificial Intelligence (AI), on the other hand, utilizes different machine learning techniques to classify malicious data from an oncoming stream of patient’s wearable data. An amalgamation of these two technologies would make the possibility of tampering the patient’s data extremely difficult. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a blockchain and AI-envisioned secure and trusted framework (HEART). Here, Long-Short Term Model (LSTM) is used to classify wearable devices as malicious or non-malicious. Then, we design a smart contract that allows only of those patients’ data having a wearable device to be classified as non-malicious to the public blockchain network. This information is then accessible to all involved in the patient’s care. We then evaluate the HEART’s performance considering various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, scalability, and network latency. On the training and testing sets, the model achieves accuracies of 93% and 92.92%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties involved, which often leads to “adversarial relationships”, “risk avoidance”, and a “lack of trust” among the different actors. This culture is further compounded by a “linear workflow” that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents a collated case study on local energy market (LEM) in Australia, in which energy users take part frequently in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among themselves considering the agile presence of energy retailers and distribution utilities. To do so, first, an overview is provided in regard to LEM architecture, trading model with energy retailers, and the blockchain structure. Then, a new P2P trading mechanism is proposed in the LEM that enables both energy users, i.e., sellers and buyers, to reap financial benefits compared to the existing business-as-usual (BAU) model - where local power is exported and imported via feed-in-tariff (FiT) and time-of-use (ToU) rates. The proposed LEM framework also exploits residential battery energy storage systems (RBESSs); and the community battery energy storage systems (CBESSs) to balance local supply and demand appropriately and contributes towards lowering exports/imports from/to power grids by means of bilateral P2P transactions while the inclusion of responsible energy retailers are assured. Moreover, the margins of both energy retailers and distribution utilities are kept unchanged or increased to some extent by the proposed trading model to incorporate them in the LEM framework effectively. Finally, diverse case studies are provided to validate the proposed LEM mechanism with various studied models and demonstrate the superior performance in contrast with the present-day BAU model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Large-scale Machine Learning (ML) based Software Systems are increasingly developed by distributed teams situated in different trust domains. Insider threats can launch attacks from any domain to compromise ML assets (models and datasets). Therefore, practitioners require information about how and by whom ML assets were developed to assess their quality attributes such as security, safety, and fairness. Unfortunately, it is challenging for ML teams to access and reconstruct such historical information of ML assets (ML provenance) because it is generally fragmented across distributed ML teams and threatened by the same adversaries that attack ML assets. This paper proposes ProML, a decentralised platform that leverages blockchain and smart contracts to empower distributed ML teams to jointly manage a single source of truth about circulated ML assets’ provenance without relying on a third party, which is vulnerable to insider threats and presents a single point of failure. We propose a novel architectural approach called Artefact-as-a-State-Machine to leverage blockchain transactions and smart contracts for managing ML provenance information and introduce a user-driven provenance capturing mechanism to integrate existing scripts and tools to ProML without compromising participants’ control over their assets and toolchains. We evaluate the performance and overheads of ProML by benchmarking a proof-of-concept system on a global blockchain. Furthermore, we assessed ProML’s security against a threat model of a distributed ML workflow. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize the model. Our experimental studies on over 11K real-world Ethereum smart contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition, our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The vulnerability of solar power producers to sunshine fluctuations exposes them to the volumetric risk that future electricity generation may deviate from predicted generation. Weather derivatives have recently emerged as a tool for hedging the volumetric risks of these power producers. However, the state-of-the-art instruments have several shortcomings, contributing to their limited application in the industry. Therefore, novel solar radiation-based weather derivative smart contract arrangements on a blockchain marketplace are proposed to address some of the main limitations of traditional instruments. In this regard, the cash flow of solar generators is modelled to assess the weather elements causing its stochasticity. Using this information, novel smart contract arrangements on a blockchain marketplace with solar radiation days as the underlying weather index are developed and analytically valued. Thereafter, a suite of novel smart contract autonomous mechanisms compelling contracting parties to behave rationally and maintain an enduring arrangement is presented. Finally, a trading strategy based on the developed smart contract arrangements is proposed to minimize the power producers' volatility risk. Results emanating from notional simulations indicate that the proposed approach could be more suitable for hedging the volumetric risks of solar power producers than traditional instruments.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed power market trading has the characteristics of large number of participants, scattered locations, small single trading scale, and point-To-point trading. The traditional centralized power trading model has the problems of large load, low efficiency, high cost, reliance on third parties and unreliable data. With the characteristics of decentralization and nontampering, blockchain can establish a point-To-point trusted trading environment and provide effective solutions to the above problems. Therefore, this paper proposed a distributed power market trading framework based on blockchain. In this framework, the distributed power supply characteristics and trading needs of each participant are analyzed, a complete distributed trading process based on blockchain is designed. In addition, we have studied the key technologies of distributed power market trading. With the goal of power service reputation and maximum revenue of distributed power providers, we have established a matching degree model, a distributed power market trading optimization model, and designed a smart contract-based power market trading optimization strategy and power trading settlement strategy.

In this study, we optimized the three-tier smart contract model and proposed a four-tier smart contract model that includes the proxy, verification, business, and storage layers. The proxy layer is used to link contracts with other layers, the verification layer is used to check the integrity, boundary values, and abnormal processes of contracts, the business layer is used to execute business logic, and the storage layer is used to store data uniformly. On the basis of the proposed model, an on-chain upgrade and verification algorithm is proposed, which implements on-chain upgrade, on-chain verification, and version compatibility of contracts. We then design an information exchange system based on the proposed model and algorithm and test it based on the FISCO BCOS platform. Experiments show that, compared to the three-tier model, the proposed four-tier model and algorithm can implement the on-chain upgrade and reduce the contract complexity and data migration cost at the cost of some overall deployment.  © 2023 Zhiqiang Du et al.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network. IEEE},

	abstract = {As a trusted decentralized application, smart contracts manage a large number of digital assets on the blockchain. Vulnerability detection of smart contracts is an important part of ensuring the security of digital assets. At present, many researchers extract features of smart contract source code for vulnerability detection based on deep learning methods. However, the current research mainly focuses on the single representation form of the source code, which cannot fully obtain the rich semantic and structural information contained in the source code, so it is not conducive to the detection of various and complex smart contract vulnerabilities. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a vulnerability detection model based on the fusion of syntax and semantic features. The syntactic and semantic representation of the source code is obtained from the abstract syntax tree and control flow graph of the smart contract through TextCNN and Graph Neural Network. The syntactic and semantic features are fused, and the fused features are used to detect vulnerabilities. Experiments show that the detection accuracy and recall rate of this model have been improved on the detection tasks of five types of vulnerabilities, with an average precision of 96% and a recall rate of 90%, which can effectively identify smart contract vulnerabilities.  © 2023 Daojun Han et al.},

We have recently experienced one of the most abrupt changes in history as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, where millions of people, businesses, schools, companies, governments, etc., have had to modify their ways of working, in addition to dealing with many other changes in the present moment, the most important of which is the transition to electronic transactions. This is a chance to progress toward smart city transformation and the implementation of models that assist citizens in their ordinary activities. One of the most common activities is the purchase of real estate. In this study, we propose a model to make the purchase and sale of real estate more equitable and fairer, and not just based on the amount of money. A smart home should be able to identify who its current owner is by functioning as an IoT badge, and, after the subject’s identity has been verified, it should be granted full access to all services, or else it should be blocked and/or alerted to the authorities. The use of smart contracts in a blockchain to transfer ownership of a smart home that includes, as inputs, those interested in acquiring a specific house and, as outputs, a person who chose the system based on the requirements previously established by the government of the Smart City. As a result, susceptibility to fraud or interference by a third person is reduced, and an individual’s security of living in a smart home, and therefore, in a smart city, is strengthened. © 2022 by the authors.},

Using blockchain technology’s smart contract technology to simplify the transaction process, the triggering mechanism and algorithm rules of smart contracts in the trading process of the platform were designed, and the smart contract code was developed, deployed, and tested using Remix IDE, and the test results showed the transaction process between the supply and demand sides. Through blockchain technology, it achieves information security and transparency in the process of resource trading in the industry interconnection supply and demand network, establishes a trust mechanism on both sides of the transaction, reduces redundant steps in the transaction and improves the operational efficiency of the industry interconnection supply and demand network by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. © 2022 by the authors.

This work proposes a symbolic model for Blindcoin and conducts comprehensive formal verification. Fine-grained security goals of Blindcoin are formalized and subsequently encoded as model lemmas. However, it is challenging to verify the Blindcoin in a formal and automatic way. To tackle the challenges, we propose a tool-friendly symbolic model that can capture the semantics of multi-layers of Bitcoin and the features of Blindcoin. Our formal verification covers real-world security scenarios and discovers the Blindcoin vulnerabilities without human interaction. Furthermore, we offer several suggestions to fix the detected Blindcoin vulnerabilities and discuss the generalization of the proposed model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context.: As self-executing programs on blockchain platforms, smart contracts can build a trusted environment between multi-parties. However, participants who lack programming knowledge usually have difficulties understanding smart contracts by reading the source code. It brings them difficulties and risks when interacting with decentralized applications. Objective.: We aim to translate the smart contract source code into natural language descriptions as fine-grained in-line comments to help people better understand, learn and operate smart contracts. Method.: We propose an automated translation approach for smart contracts written in Solidity, termed SolcTrans, based on an Syntax Tree (AST) and formal grammar. We have investigated representative Solidity smart contracts, identified the AST parsing paths and core attributes used for translation, and proposed corresponding translation templates for special statements. Then, we leveraged reinforcement learning to train a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar-based syntax synthesizer used to generate comprehensible English sentences as comments. Result.: The experimental results show that SolcTrans outperforms four state-of-the-art neural machine translation models under currently available training data and is less affected by lengths of code snippets and translation outputs. We also conducted a human evaluation among 20 volunteers and asked them to score the generated comments. The results demonstrate that SolcTrans performs well on three metrics: Accuracy, Readability, and Instructiveness. Conclusion.: Our approach produces high-quality fine-grained comments for smart contract source code under the small training dataset, which creates a paradigm for future studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In Smart Grid (SG), Transactive Energy Management (TEM) is one of the most promising approaches to boost consumer participation in energy generation, energy management, and establishing decentralized energy market models using Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2P, a prosumer produces electric energy at their place using Renewable Energy Resources (RES) such as solar energy, wind energy, etc. Then, this generated energy is traded with consumers (who need the energy) in a nearby locality. P2P facilitates energy exchange in localized micro-energy markets of the TEM system. Such decentralized P2P energy management could cater to diverse prosumers and utility business models. However, the existing P2P approaches suffer from several issues such as single-point-of-failure, network bandwidth, scalability, trust, and security issues. To handle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized and Transparent P2P Energy Trading (DT-P2PET) scheme using blockchain. The proposed DT-P2PET scheme aims to reduce the grid’s energy generation and management burden while also increasing profit for both consumers and prosumers through a dynamic pricing mechanism. The DT-P2PET scheme uses Ethereum-blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for the P2P energy trading. Furthermore, a recommender mechanism is also introduced in this study to increase the number of prosumers. The Ethereum SCs are designed and deployed to perform P2P in real time in the proposed DT-P2PET scheme. The DT-P2PET scheme is evaluated based on the various parameters such as profit generation (for prosumer and consumer both), data storage cost, network bandwidth, and data transfer rate in contrast to the existing approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the process of cultivation, from the point of deciding to plant a certain crop to the point of selling harvest to the market, farmers incur many expenses at different stages of the crop life cycle. 75% of smallholder farmers around the world includes the world’s poorest. Most of them face constraints in getting finance to cover such costs. Microfinance, a method of offering small loans to the marginal, has evolved as a major institutional source to provide financial facilities to such people. Although there is ample evidence showing that microfinance has a positive impact on economic activities, securing the livelihood of the marginal people by uplifting their economic status, it can be a dilemma at the same time, since the severe indebtedness caused by microfinance loans has led impoverished communities to economic, social, and environmental vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based conceptual model for sustainable microfinance outreach for farmers where the microfinance institutes can dynamically adjust the loans they provide according to the farmer’s actions resulting in a reduction in severe indebtedness and vulnerabilities while smoothing the crop cultivation process leading to better farm outputs and income.

	abstract = {In the context of the rapid development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have also been widely used in the Internet of Things, finance, healthcare, and other fields. There has been an explosion in the number of smart contracts, and at the same time, the security of smart contracts has received widespread attention because of the financial losses caused by smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing analysis tools can detect many smart contract security vulnerabilities, but because they rely too heavily on hard rules defined by experts when detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, the time to perform the detection increases significantly as the complexity of the smart contract increases. In the present study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model named CBGRU that strategically combines different word embedding (Word2Vec, FastText) with different deep learning methods (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN, BiGRU). The model extracts features through different deep learning models and combine these features for smart contract vulnerability detection. On the currently publicly available dataset SmartBugs Dataset-Wild, we demonstrate that the CBGRU hybrid model has great smart contract vulnerability detection performance through a series of experiments. By comparing the performance of the proposed model with that of past studies, the CBGRU model has better smart contract vulnerability detection performance. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The key issue in the field of smart contract security is efficient and rapid vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Most of the existing detection methods can only detect the presence of vulnerabilities in the contract and can hardly identify their type. Furthermore, they have poor scalability. To resolve these issues, in this study, we developed a smart contract vulnerability detection model based on multi‐task learning. By setting auxiliary tasks to learn more directional vulnerability features, the detection capability of the model was improved to realize the detection and recognition of vulnerabilities. The model is based on a hard‐sharing design, which consists of two parts. First, the bottom sharing layer is mainly used to learn the semantic information of the input contract. The text representation is first transformed into a new vector by word and positional embedding, and then the neural network, based on an attention mechanism, is used to learn and extract the feature vector of the contract. Second, the task‐specific layer is mainly employed to realize the functions of each task. A classical convolutional neural network was used to construct a classification model for each task that learns and extracts features from the shared layer for training to achieve their respective task objectives. The experimental results show that the model can better identify the types of vulnerabilities after adding the auxiliary vulnerability detection task. This model realizes the detection of vulnerabilities and recognizes three types of vulnerabilities. The multi‐task model was observed to perform better and is less expensive than a single‐task model in terms of time, computation, and storage. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Version control is an important component of configuration management, and most enterprise-level software uses different tools and technologies to manage the software version control such as CVS, Subversion, or Perforce. Following the success of bitcoin, the first practical application of blockchain, it is being implemented in other fields such as healthcare, supply chains, financial management, real estate, electoral systems, and so on. Blockchain’s core features include decentralization, immutability, and interminability. Most version control repositories are centralized and can be modified by external sources, implying that they are in danger of being corrupted or controlled. In this study, we present the BDA-SCV architecture for implementing a version control system in blockchain technology. Our proposed approach would replace the necessity for a centralized system, with a decentralized approach implemented in the blockchain using distributed file storage, for which we will use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which is a distributed file system. The proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm will be used to approve the developer communicating modifications to the private blockchain network; the authority will only provide permission and will not be able to add, edit, or delete code files. For each change, a ledger block will be created with a reference to the file stored in the distributed repository. A block cannot be manipulated once it has been created. Smart contracts will be used to register developers, create blocks, and manage the repository. The suggested model is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric network, and the developer and authorizer ends are built into the dotnet web application. © 2023 by the authors.},

Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, any bugs or errors will become permanent once published and could lead to huge economic losses. Recently, a great number of security problems have been exposed in smart contracts. It is important to verify the correctness of smart contracts before they are deployed on the blockchain. This paper aims to verify the correctness of smart contracts in Ethereum transactions, and the model checker Spin is adopted for the formal verification of smart contracts in order to ensure their execution with respect to parties’ willingness, as well as their reliable interaction with clients. In this direction, we propose a formal method to construct the models for smart contracts. Then, the method is applied to a study case in the Ethereum commodity market. Finally, a case model is implemented in Spin, which can simulate the process’s execution and verify the properties that are abstracted from the requirements. Compared with existing techniques, formal analysis can verify whether smart contracts comply with the specifications for given behaviors and strengthen the credibility of smart contracts in the transaction. © 2022 by the authors.},

However, frequent smart contract security incidents have focused more and more attention on their security and reliability, and smart contract vulnerability detection has become an urgent problem in blockchain security. Most of the existing methods rely on fixed rules defined by experts, which have the disadvantages of single detection type, poor scalability, and high false alarm rate. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a method that combines Bi-LSTM and an attention mechanism for multiple vulnerability detection of smart contract opcodes. First, we preprocessed the data to convert the opcodes into a feature matrix suitable as the input of the neural network and then used the Bi-LSTM model based on the attention mechanism to classify smart contracts with multiple labels. The experimental results show that the model can detect multiple vulnerabilities at the same time, and all evaluation indicators exceeded 85%, which proves the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper for multiple vulnerability detection tasks in smart contracts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) technology is capable of achieving accurate ciphertext retrieval while protecting data privacy. However, curious or malicious semi-trusted cloud servers can cause privacy breaches, which then creates a trust problem for ciphertext management and searching. To address this problem, we propose a trusted certificateless authentication public-key encryption with a keyword search scheme in cloud storage (TCA-PEKS), which ensuring trusted retrieval, simultaneously resolves the problems of key escrow and certificate management that exist in PEKS. In the scheme, the security of the ciphertext storage and verifications are strengthened based on blockchain non-tampering features, which assists users in verifying the correctness of a file. In particular, we construct an open and transparent smart contract to limit the malicious behaviour of cloud servers, in which the user’s complete private key splits the secret value and the partial private key, further guaranteeing the correctness of the retrieval process. Finally, the scheme is proven to satisfy ciphertext and trapdoor indistinguishability under the random oracle model, and the performance evaluation results show that the scheme is highly efficient. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Authentication while maintaining anonymity when availing a service over the internet is a significant privacy challenge. Anonymous credentials (AC) address this by providing the user with a credential issued by a trusted entity that convinces the service provider (SP) that the user is authenticated but reveals no other information. The existing AC schemes assume a single trusted authority (certifier) that validates all the user attributes. In practice, however, a user may require different attributes to be attested by different certifiers. This means that the user has to get multiple credentials, increasing the burden on the SP who has to verify each one of them. Moreover, complete anonymity can be misused. We propose a decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential (DTRAC) scheme over blockchains that supports - a) attestation of attributes by multiple certifiers, and b) anonymity revocation through a set of distributed openers, by integrating threshold opening to the state-of-the-art threshold anonymous credential issuance scheme, Coconut [35]. DTRAC generates a single credential on attributes that are attested by multiple certifiers, freeing the SP from the hassle of verifying multiple credentials. We analyze the security of DTRAC formally in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also implement a prototype on Ethereum using smart contracts and give a detailed analysis of its performance. We compare the verification time for credentials with attributes attested by multiple certifiers in both DTRAC and Coconut and see that in terms of execution time and gas consumption, DTRAC performs significantly better than Coconut. It also scales better, with the performance gain of DTRAC over Coconut increasing linearly with the number of certifiers.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The opportunistic fog radio access network (OF-RAN) expands its offloading computation capacity on-demand by establishing virtual fog access points (v-FAPs), comprising user devices with idle resources recruited opportunistically to execute the offloaded tasks in a distributed manner. OF-RAN is attractive for providing computation offloading services to resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices from vertical industrial applications such as smart transportation, tourism, mobile healthcare, and public safety. However, the current OF-RAN design is lacking a trusted and distributed mechanism for automating its processes such as v-FAP formation and service execution. Motivated by the recent emergence of blockchain, with smart contracts as an enabler of trusted and distributed systems, we propose an automated mechanism for OF-RAN processes using smart contracts. To demonstrate how our smart-contract-based automation for OF-RAN could apply in real life, a federated deep learning (DL) use-case where a resource-limited client offloads the resource-intensive training of its DL model to a v-FAP is implemented and evaluated. The results validate the DL and blockchain performances of the proposed smart-contract-enabled OF-RAN. The appropriate setting of process parameters to meet the often competing requirements is also demonstrated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts constitute the foundation for blockchain distributed applications. These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {While blockchain systems are quickly gaining popularity, front-running remains a major obstacle to fair exchange. In this paper, we show how to apply identity-based encryption (IBE) to prevent front-running with minimal bandwidth overheads. In our approach, to decrypt a block of N transactions, the number of messages sent across the network only grows linearly with the size of decrypting committees, S. That is, to decrypt a set of N transactions sequenced at a specific block, a committee only needs to exchange S decryption shares (independent of N). In comparison, previous solutions are based on threshold decryption schemes, where each transaction in a block must be decrypted separately by the committee, resulting in bandwidth overhead of N× S. Along the way, we present a model for fair block processing and build a prototype implementation. We show that on a sample of 1000 messages with 1000 validators our system saves 42.53 MB of bandwidth which is 99.6% less compared with the standard threshold decryption paradigm. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Unfortunately, the engagement is still low due to concerns related to the privacy of their energy data used in the prediction processes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based distributed federated learning (FL) technique for energy-demand prediction that combines FL with blockchain to provide data privacy and trust features for energy prosumers. The privacy-sensitive energy data are stored locally at edge prosumer nodes without revealing it to third parties, with only the learned local model weights being shared using a blockchain network. The global federated model is not centralized but distributed and replicated over the blockchain overlay, ensuring the model immutability and provenance of parameter updates. We had proposed smart contracts to deal with the integration of local machine-learning prediction models with the blockchain, defining functions for the model parameters’ scaling and reduction of blockchain overhead. The centralized, local-edge, and blockchain-integrated models are comparatively evaluated for prediction of energy demand 24 h ahead using a multi-layer perceptron model and the monitored energy data of several prosumers. The results show only a slight decrease in prediction accuracy in the case of blockchain-based distributed FL with reliable data privacy support compared with the centralized learning solution. © 2022 by the authors.},

To this end, we propose a blockchain-based access control and behavior regulation system for IoT. Relying on the attribute-based access control model, this system deploys smart contracts on the blockchain to achieve distributed and fine-grained access control and ensures that the identity and authority of access users can be trusted. At the same time, an inter-domain communication mechanism is designed based on the locator/identifier separation protocol and ensures the traffic of access users are authorized. A feedback module that combines traffic detection and credit evaluation is proposed, ensuring real-time detection and fast, proactive responses against malicious behavior. Ultimately, all modules are linked together through workflows to form an integrated security model.

	abstract = {By 2050, the world's population will have increased by 34%, to more than 9 billion people, needing a 70% increase in food production. Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain's transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item's authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m2 cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system. By 2050, the world's population will need a 70% increase in food production. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model.

Deep learning neural network is applied to the vulnerability analysis and detection of smart contracts in blockchain technology by analyzing the connotation of blockchain technology and deep learning. A multiparty joint financial service platform based on blockchain technology is established to help SMEs financing institutions reduce transaction costs, thereby helping them reduce loan interest rates. Finally, Jiangsu Province is studied as a pilot unit. The results show that the Recall and F-score of Bidirectional Neural Network for smart contract vulnerability detection are higher than those of the original neural network. The Recall rate and F-score value of the Wide and Deep model are up to 96.2% and 94.7%, which are higher than those of other vulnerability detection schemes. The Timestamp vulnerability has the highest Recall rate, 94.2%, which can rely on a large amount of valid data to improve detection efficiency. The distribution of financing needs of SMEs in Jiangsu Province from 2020 to 2021 shows that the loan number of SMEs is generally not high. Still, financial institutions and enterprises must spend the same transaction cost. After a technology company in Nanjing made a loan through a blockchain financial service platform, its financing cost decreased by 0.5331%.

	abstract = {Current blockchain‐based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self‐adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self‐adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so‐called selfadaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE‐BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self‐adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t‐test and Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self‐adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

It automatically extracts structural sequences from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Then, two discriminators are designed to guide the Transformer encoder to learn local and global semantic features of smart contracts.

	abstract = {An algorithmic stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency managed by algorithms (i.e., smart contracts) to dynamically minimize the volatility of its price relative to a specific form of asset, e.g., US dollar. As algorithmic stablecoins have been growing rapidly in recent years, they become much more volatile than expected. In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of algorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research questions, i.e., Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they volatile in practice? Specifically, we introduced an in-depth study on three popular types of algorithmic stablecoins and developed a modeling framework to formalize their key design protocols. Through formal verification, the framework can identify critical conditions under which stablecoins might become volatile. Furthermore, we performed a systematic empirical analysis on real transaction activities of the Basis Cash stablecoin to relate theoretical possibilities to market observations. Lastly, we highlighted key design decisions for future development of algorithmic stablecoins. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are becoming increasingly popular in the last years. They collect reviews concerning several types of items (e.g., shops, professionals, services, songs or videos) in order to rank them according to a given criterion, and to suggest the most relevant ones to their users. However, most of the currently used RSs exhibit two main drawbacks: they are based on a centralized control model and they do not provide reward mechanisms to encourage the participation of users. To deal with these challenges, the architectures of current RSs could be enhanced through blockchain technology, thus providing novel solutions to decentralize them. As a matter of fact, the blockchain technology could be successfully adopted in this context because smart contracts would allow the decentralization of system control, while cryptocurrency and tokens could be used to implement the reward mechanism. In the light of the above considerations, this manuscript presents a decentralized rating framework aimed to support the users of RSs based on blockchain technology, providing a token-based reward mechanism that remunerates users submitting their reviews to incentivize their participation. Moreover, the proposed system provides a flexible strategy to rank items, allowing users to choose among different functions to combine reviews to obtain item ranking. The performance and the cost of using the proposed system have been evaluated on the Ropsten Ethereum test network. For instance, our experiments have shown that the median time required to store a batch of 35 ratings is about 47 s, while the average time required to obtain the score of an item having 6000 ratings is less than 2.5 s. © 2021},

	abstract = {In the era of the fourth industrial revolution (In-dustry 4.0), many Management Information Systems (MIS) integrate real-time data collection and use technologies such as big data, machine learning, and cloud computing, to foster a wide range of creative innovations, business improvements, and new business models and processes. However, the integration of blockchain with MIS offers the blockchain trilemma of security, decentralisation and scalability. MIS are usually Web 2.0 client-server applications that include the front end web systems and back end databases; while blockchain systems are Web 3.0 decentralised applications. MIS are usually private systems that a single party controls and manages; while blockchain systems are usually public, and any party can join and participate. This paper clarifies the key concepts and illustrates with figures, the implementation of public, private and consortium blockchains on the Ethereum platform. Ultimately, the paper presents a framework for building a private blockchain system on the public Ethereum blockchain.

	abstract = {Blockchain has attracted broad interests to build decentralised applications. A typical class of applications uses blockchain for the management of cross-organisational business processes as well as assets. However, developing such applications without introducing vulnerabilities is hard for developers, not the least because the deployed code is immutable and can be called by anyone with access to the network. Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps to reduce those risks, by combining proven code snippets as per the model specification, which is easier to understand than source code. Therefore, in this article, we present an approach for integrated MDE across business processes and asset management (e.g., for settlement). Our approach includes methods for fungible/non-fungible asset registration, escrow for conditional payment, and asset swap. The proposed MDE approach is implemented in a smart contract generation tool called Lorikeet, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, functional correctness, and cost effectiveness. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business activities have aroused great interest from organizations because of the benefits they offer. However, sharing data, services, and resources and exposing them to external use can prevent organizations involved in collaboration from being engaged. Therefore, the need for advanced mechanisms to ensure trust between the different parties involved is paramount. In this context, blockchain and smart contracts are promising solutions for performing choreography processes. However, the seamless integration of these technologies as non-functional requirements in the design and implementation phases of inter-organizational collaborative activities is a challenging task, as reported in the literature. Consequently, we aim in the proposed approach to extend the modeling and implementation of the choreography lifecycle based on service-oriented processes. This is fulfilled by integrating blockchain transactions and smart contract calls, to allow collaboration and interoperability between different entities while guaranteeing trust and auditability. Moreover, to conduct this extension efficiently we use a BPMN choreography diagram combined with Finite State Automata to ensure a meticulous modeling which targets the processes’ internal interactions. Hyperledger Fabric is used as a permissioned blockchain for proof-of-concept implementation. A use case of COVID-19 collaborative processes is used to experiment our approach, which aims to guarantee a fluid collaboration between healthcare providers and epidemiological entities at a national scale in Morocco. © 2021.

	abstract = {The transfer of market power in electric generation from utilities to end-users spurred by the diffusion of distributed energy resources necessitates a new system of settlement in the electricity business that can better manage generation assets at the grid-edge. A new concept in facilitating distributed generation is peer-to-peer energy trading, where households exchange excess power with neighbors at a price they set themselves. However, little is known about the effects of peer-to-peer energy trading on the sociotechnical dynamics of electric power systems. Further, given the novelty of the concept, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of alternative electricity market structures and individual decision strategies on neighborhood exchanges and market outcomes. This study develops an empirical agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate peer-to-peer electricity trades in a decentralized residential energy market. The framework is applied for a case study in Perth, Western Australia, where a blockchain-enabled energy trading platform was trialed among 18 households, which acted as prosumers or consumers. The ABM is applied for a set of alternative electricity market structures. Results assess the impact of solar generation forecasting approaches, battery energy storage, and ratio of prosumers to consumers on the dynamics of peer-to-peer energy trading systems. Designing an efficient, equitable, and sustainable future energy system hinges on the recognition of trade-offs on and across, social, technological, economic, and environmental levels. Results demonstrate that the ABM can be applied to manage emerging uncertainties by facilitating the testing and development of management strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Currently, food quality has become a major concern for the food industry. To efficiently detect food quality problems during the production process, food enterprises must build quality monitoring systems. However, in a traditional quality monitoring system, data tampering and centralized storage have become barriers to reliability. In addition, due to lack of sufficient automation, traditional quality monitoring approaches are usually inefficient. Fortunately, blockchain is a promising technology that is tamper-proof and decentralized. Moreover, smart contracts, which are executable codes on the blockchain platform, are able to conduct transactions between mutually untrusted parties and are self-executing and self-verifying. By combining smart contracts and quality evaluation models, this paper presents an intelligent quality monitoring system for fruit juice production. This system has the characteristics of high automation and high reliability. In this system, response surface models are established based on preproduction data, and the optimal production condition for each stage is identified. During the actual production process, smart contracts are executed to record production data on a blockchain. These data serve as the inputs for evaluation models. Based on the evaluation outcome, smart contracts will decide whether the production process can be resumed or not. To evaluate the feasibility of the presented system, a prototype version of the quality monitoring system for flat peach juice production is implemented based on the Ethereum platform and executed in the Remix IDE. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Pool hopping attack is the result of miners leaving the pool when it offers fewer financial rewards and joining back when the rewards of mining yield higher rewards in blockchain networks. This act of leaving and rejoining the pool only during the good times results in the miner receiving more rewards than the computational power they contribute. Miners exiting the pool deprive it of its collective hash power, which leaves the pool unable to mine the block successfully. This results in its competitors mining the block before they can finish mining. Existing research shows pool hopping resistant measures and detection strategies; however, they do not offer any robust preventive solution to discourage miners from leaving the mining pool. To prevent pool hopping attacks, a smart contract-based pool hopping attack prevention model is proposed. The main objective of our research is maintaining the symmetrical relationship between the miners by requiring them all to continually contribute their computational power to successfully mine a block. We implement a ledger containing records of all miners, in the form of a miner certificate, which tracks the history of the miner's earlier behavior. The certificate enables a pool manager to better initiate terms of the smart contract, which safeguards the interests of existing mining pool members. The model prevents frequent mine hoppers from pool hopping as they submit coins in the form of an escrow and risk losing them if they abandon the pool before completing mining of the block. The key critical factors that every pool hopping attack prevention solution must address and a study of comparative analysis with existing solutions are presented in the paper. © 2019 by the authors.},

The number of smart contracts has grown at a high rate and nearly at an average of thousands per day. However, the correctness and security of the smart contract itself are facing huge problems. The well-known DAO vulnerability, and Parity multi-signature wallet’ vulnerabilities have leaded to a hundreds of millions dollars loss, and they are both caused by the security problems of smart contracts. Once the smart contract vulnerability is exploited, it is very likely to bring the loss of cryptocurrencies, the disorder of the financial order and other catastrophic consequences. Therefore the security of smart contracts is imminent. This project has designed and implemented a vulnerability detection system of Ethereum smart contract. The system uses the assembly instruction sequences of the smart contract to generate the control flow graph, then performs symbolic execution and vulnerability constraint solving over the control flow. The system can detect some common types of vulnerabilities, such as the integer overflow and underflow vulnerability, reentry vulnerability and unchecked call return value vulnerability. It has a high accuracy of detection result, and gives support for export vulnerability report. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {An emerging healthcare delivery model is enabling a new era of clinical care based on well-informed decision-making processes. Current healthcare information systems (HISs) fall short of adopting this model due to a conflict between information security needed to implement the new model and those already enforced locally to support traditional care models. Meanwhile, in recent times, the healthcare sector has shown a substantial interest in the potential of using blockchain technology for providing quality care to patients. No blockchain solution proposed so far has fully addressed emerging cross-organization information-sharing needs in healthcare. In this paper, we aim to study the use of blockchain in equipping struggling HISs to cope with the demands of the new healthcare delivery model, by proposing HealthyBlockchain as a granular patient-centered ledger that digitally tracks a patient's medical transactions all along the treatment pathway to support the care teams. The patient-centered ledger is a neutral tamper-proof trail timestamp block sequence that governs distributed patient information across the decentralized discrete HISs. HealthyBlockchain connects patients, clinicians, and healthcare providers to facilitate a transparent, trustworthy, and secure supporting platform. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {Blockchain ecosystems are rapidly maturing and meeting the needs of business environ-ments (e.g., industry, manufacturing, and robotics). The decentralized approaches in industries enable novel business concepts, such as machine autonomy and servitization of manufacturing envi-ronments. Introducing the distributed ledger technology principles into the machine sharing and servitization economy faces several challenges, and the integration opens new interesting research questions. Our research focuses on data and event models and secure upgradeable smart contract platforms for machine servitization. Our research indicates that with the proposed approaches, we can efficiently separate on-and off-chain data and assure scalability of the DApp without compro-mising the trust. We demonstrate that the secure upgradeable smart contract platform, which was adapted for machine servitization, supports the business workflow and, at the same time, assures common identification and authorization of all the participants in the system, including people, de-vices, and legal entities. We present a hybrid decentralized application (DApp) for the servitization of 3D printing. The solution can be used for or easily adapted to other manufacturing domains. It comprises a modular, upgradeable smart contract platform and off-chain machine, customer and web management, and monitoring interfaces. We pay special attention to the data and event models during the design, which are fundamental for the hybrid data storage and DApp architecture and the responsiveness of off-chain interfaces. The smart contract platform uses a proxy contract to control the access of smart contracts and role-based access control in function calls for blockchain users. We deploy and evaluate the DApp in a consortium blockchain network for performance and pri-vacy. All the actors in the solution, including the machines, are identified by their blockchain ac-counts and are compeers. Our solution thus facilitates integration with the traditional information-communication systems in terms of the hybrid architectures and security standards for smart contract design comparable to those in traditional software engineering. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Building trust relationships between different decentralized entities in the IoT ecosystem is essential. Hereof, the combination of blockchain technology and trust evaluation techniques is recently considered as an efficient measure. However, both technologies within the IoT are still facing some limitations which are addressed in this research. First, this publication reviews various blockchain-based trust approaches and depicts their strengths and limitations regarding their usage in decentralized IoT communities. Then, an optimized trust model with a multi-layer adaptive and trust-based weighting system is proposed. Additionally, different trust metric parameters and their mathematical models used for trust evaluation are presented. Moreover, this publication presents a novel approach for incentivization processes in the IoT marketplace using control loops and smart contracts. Thereby, participants are motivated to continuously improve their behavior. Finally, the proposed trust model is proved to be reliable. The experimental results conducted from different scenarios show that the presented approach provides more resiliency against various attacks than existing ones.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A public private partnership (PPP) is an agreement between a public and a private party to achieve a strategic objective. The PPP model is based on three principles: risk allocation and transfer, affordability, and value for money. Traditionally, PPPs have been leveraged for hard service development such as infrastructure development. The advancement of technology within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has created new opportunities and risks for PPPs as important mechanisms for the promotion of development. The 4IR has implications for government service delivery, which have brought about an increased demand for service delivery innovation and the development of information and communications technology (ICT). Although PPPs have traditionally focused on hard services, it is important to consider PPPs for soft service delivery. It is therefore necessary to rethink the role of the PPP model as an alternative service delivery mechanism. The aim of this article is to discuss risk allocation in ICT PPPs. The research approach is qualitative in nature. The research method is based on a desktop analysis of literature and secondary data utilising unobtrusive research techniques such as conceptual and documentary analyses. The article identified various risks and opportunities for PPPs for service delivery innovation. These partnerships are often faced with high levels of uncertainty in terms of funding, level of stakeholder commitment, and complex relationships. Other risks include vendor financing, market risk, intellectual property (IP) risk, data governance, and regulatory risk. The deployment of ICT can reinforce and expand PPPs beyond all previous limitations and boundaries. This research makes proposals for good practices for risk allocation in ICT PPPs. © 2020, Social Sciences Research Society.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, business enactments almost exclusively focus on human-to-human business transactions. However, the ubiquitousness of smart devices enables business enactments among autonomously acting machines, thereby providing the foundation for the machine-driven Machine-to-Everything (M2X) Economy. Human-to-human business is governed by enforceable contracts either in the form of oral, or written agreements. Still, a machine-driven ecosystem requires a digital equivalent that is accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, an electronic contract platform enables fact-tracking, non-repudiation, auditability and tamper-resistant storage of information in a distributed multi-stakeholder setting. A suitable approach for M2X enactments are electronic smart contracts that allow to govern business transactions using a computerized transaction protocol such as a blockchain. In this position paper, we argue in favor of an open, decentralized and distributed smart contract-based M2X Economy that supports the corresponding multi-stakeholder ecosystem and facilitates M2X value exchange, collaborations, and business enactments. Finally, it allows for a distributed e-governance model that fosters open platforms and interoperability. Thus, serving as a foundation for the ubiquitous M2X Economy and its ecosystem. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Blockchain decentralized applications (DApp's) are applications which run on blockchains nodes. Thus, to interact directly with this sort of applications, users need to have a blockchain address, wallet, and knowledge about how to make transactions to interact with DApp's. Therefore, the knowledge required to use a DApp can easily make users to desist when trying to interact with them. To tackle this issue, we propose a software architecture that will be in the middle of the user and the DApp, thus making users initially unaware of the fact that they are interacting with a DApp. This is achieved by analyzing the relationship between DApps and Apps by using UML modelling. Next, based on the previous analysis, we created a middleware for users to interact with a DApp in the same manner they do with a traditional web app, i.e., by using usernames, passwords and user interface elements instead of addresses, private keys or transactions. To put the developed middleware into practice, we developed a DApp that makes use of it. This DApp registers the time control of workers from companies by using blockchain to store the data in a secure and non-modifiable manner. Finally, we performed an experiment, thus demonstrating that a DApp that implements the proposed middleware would improve its usability for users with no experience with blockchain. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: In the collaborative business environment, blockchain coupled with smart contract removes the reliance on a central system and offers data integrity which is crucial when the transacting parties rely on the shared data. The acceptance of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for the continued use of the services. Despite many extensive studies evaluating the performance of blockchain-based systems, few have focused on users’ acceptance of real-life applications. Objective: The main objective of this research is to evaluate the user acceptance of a real-life blockchain-based system (BBS) by observing various latent variables affecting the development of users’ attitudes and intention to use the system. It also aims to uncover the dimensions and role of trust, security and privacy alongside the primary Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-based predictors and their causal relationship with the users’ behavior to adopt such BBS. Methods: We tested the augmented TAM with Trust Model on a BBS that comprises two subsystems: a Shopping Cart System (SCS), a system oriented towards end-users and a Data Sharing System (DSS), a system oriented towards system administrators. We set research questions and hypotheses, and conducted online surveys by requesting each participant to respond to the questionnaire after using the respective system. The main study comprises two separate sub-studies: the first study was performed on SCS and the second on DSS. Furthermore, each study data comprises initial pre-test and post-test data scores. We analyzed the research model with partial least square structural equation modelling. Results: The empirical study validates our research model and supports most of the research hypotheses. Based on our findings, we deduce that TAM-based predictors and trust constructs cannot be applied uniformly to BBS. Depending on the specifics of the BBS, the relationships between perceived trust antecedents and attitudes towards the system might change. For SCS, trust is the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system, while DSS has perceived privacy as the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system. Quality of system shows the strongest total effect on intention to use SCS, while perceived usefulness has the strongest total effect on intention to use DSS. Trust has a positive significant effect on users’ attitudes towards both BSS, while security does not have any significant effect on users’ attitudes toward BBS. In SCS, privacy positively affects trust, but security has no significant effect on trust, whereas, in DSS, both privacy and security have significant effects on trust. In both BBS, trust has a moderating effect on privacy that correlates with attitudes towards BBS, whereas security does not have any mediating role between privacy and attitudes towards BBS. Hence, we recommend that while developing BBS, particular attention should be paid to increasing user trust and perceived privacy. © Copyright 2021 Shrestha et al.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of smart devices has exploded, leading to an unprecedented increase in demand for video live and video-on-demand (VoD) services. Also, the privacy of video providers and requesters and the security of requested video data are much more threatened. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, a blockchain-enabled CMEC video transmission model (Bl-CMEC) for intelligent video caching and transcoding will be proposed to ensure the transactions' transparency, system security, user information privacy, and integrity of the video data, enhance the ability of severs in actively caching popular video content in the CMEC system, and realize transcoding function at network edge nodes. Furthermore, we chose a scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to intelligently access the intracluster joint caching and transcoding decisions. Then, the joint video caching and transcoding decision smart contract is specially designed to automatically manage the transaction process of the joint caching and transcoding service, which records key information of joint caching and transcoding transactions and payment information on a continuous blockchain. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Bl-CMEC framework not only can provide users with better QoE performance for video streaming service but also can ensure the security, integrity, and consistency for the video providers, video requesters, and video data.  © 2021 Yan Li and Zheng Wan.},

	abstract = {This paper explores a potential paradigm shift in trade finance utilizing blockchain technology. Traditionally, the centralized operating model has governed trade finance and the manner in which traders handle business processes. However, such heavy reliance on centralized authorities has made for poor performance, the lack of flexibility and transparency, and vulnerability to malicious alteration. The blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology (DLT), has attracted growing attention and has the potential to disrupt legacy finance procedures such as payment by letter of credit (L/C). International trade players may benefit from the technological reengineering of financial processes through the implementation of blockchain-and smart contract-based platforms. From the conceptual perspective of a paradigm shift, this study analyzes the feasibility of blockchain innovation in trade finance through modern blockchain-based L/C initiatives. Moreover, this study also explores blockchain applications in terms of logistics tracking and how it integrates with trade finance procedures. This study contributes to the understanding of a blockchain paradigm shift with a multi-case study. The results may illuminate the potential future application of blockchain finance and provide researchers with an illustrative example of other finance-related capabilities. Studies of trade-related topics such as customs clearances, insurance, and logistics applications need to be addressed in the future to create a comprehensively trustless environment and facilitate the automation of trade. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper studies contractual graphs, where the formation of edges between nodes result in dyadic exchanges. Each dyadic exchange is analyzed as a contractual agreement that is implemented upon fulfilment of underlying conditions. As these dyadic exchanges proliferate, the resulting population of these exchanges creates a contractual graph. A contractual framework for graphs is especially useful in applications where AI-enabled software is employed to create or automate smart contracts between nodes. While some smart contracts may be easily created and executed, others may contain a higher level of ambiguity which may prevent their efficient implementation. Ambiguity in contractual elements is especially difficult to implement, since nodes have to efficiently sense the ambiguity and allocate appropriate amounts of computational resources to the ambiguous contractual task. This paper develops a two-node contractual model of graphs, with varying levels of ambiguity in the contracts and examines its consequences for a market where tasks of differing ambiguity are available to be completed by nodes. The central theme of this paper is that as ambiguity increases, it is difficult for nodes to efficiently commit to the contract since there is an uncertainty in the amount of resources that they have to allocate for completion of the tasks specified in the contract. Thus, while linguistic ambiguity or situational ambiguity might not be cognitively burdensome for humans, it might become expensive for nodes involved in the smart contract. The paper also shows that timing matters—the order in which nodes enter the contract is important as they proceed to sense the ambiguity in a task and then allocate appropriate resources. We propose a game-theoretic formulation to scrutinize how nodes that move first to complete a task are differently impacted than those that move second. We discuss the applications of such a contractual framework for graphs and obtain conditions under which two-node contracts can achieve a successful coalition. Copyright © 2021 Murimi.},

	abstract = {Programming errors in Ethereum smart contracts can result in catastrophic financial losses from stolen cryptocurrency. While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation. However, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation, which is nevertheless applicable for practical use. © 2021 The Authors},

However, most early warning systems are centralized and isolated, thus there are potential risks of single evidence bias and decision-making errors. In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organizations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality. It also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {With the rapidly developing of Internet of Things (IoT), the volume of data generated by IoT systems is increasing quickly. To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

However, this monetization model was originally intended to replace advertising as a source of revenue for a website. To resolve such problems, a storage verification architecture based on smart contracts was proposed in the study. The decentralized system of blockchain enables users to identify and participate in verification of mining sites through Ethereum smart contracts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Novel models and standards for this particular insurance market are essential due to the use of modern IT (Information Technology) and since insurance providers need to create suitable models for customers. In this work, a refreshing approach SaCI for the deployment and management of contract coverage is introduced. SaCI translates relevant information of a cyber insurance contract to Smart Contracts (SC) running on the Blockchain (BC). Thus, SaCI (i) allows for recording agreements in an immutable way, (ii) simplifies interactions between stakeholders (e.g., customers and insurers), and (iii) ensures a trustworthy and transparent process during the life-cycle of the contract. A case study is provided to show evidence of the feasibility of the approach, which is backed by a cost analysis and discussion regarding especially the application of BCs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {We propose a model for games in which the players have shared access to a blockchain that allows them to deploy smart contracts to act on their behalf. This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions about rationality since a contract can commit a player to act irrationally in specific subgames, making credible otherwise non-credible threats. This is further complicated by considering the interaction between multiple contracts which can reason about each other. This changes the nature of the game in a nontrivial way as choosing which contract to play can itself be considered a move in the game. Our model generalizes known notions of equilibria, with a single contract being equivalent to a Stackelberg equilibrium, and two contracts being equivalent to a reverse Stackelberg equilibrium. We prove a number of bounds on the complexity of computing SPE in such games with smart contracts. We show that computing an SPE is PSPACE -hard in the general case. Specifically, in games with k contracts, we show that computing an SPE is ΣkP -hard for games of imperfect information. We show that computing an SPE remains PSPACE -hard in games of perfect information if we allow for an unbounded number of contracts. We give an algorithm for computing an SPE in two-contract games of perfect information that runs in time O(mℓ) where m is the size of the game tree and ℓ is the number of terminal nodes. Finally, we conjecture the problem to be NP -complete for three contracts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The application of blockchains techniques in the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining much attention with new solutions proposed in diverse areas of the IoT. Conventionally IoT systems are designed to follow the centralised paradigm where security and privacy control is vested on a 'trusted' third-party. This design leaves the user at the mercy of a sovereign broker and in addition, susceptible to several attacks. The implicit trust and the inferred reliability of centralised systems have been challenged recently following several privacy violations and personal data breaches. Consequently, there is a call for more secure decentralised systems that allows for finer control of user privacy while providing secure communication. Propitiously, the blockchain holds much promise and may provide the necessary framework for the design of a secure IoT system that guarantees fine-grained user privacy in a trustless manner. In this paper, we propose a holistic blockchain-based decentralised model for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment. The nodes in our proposed model utilize smart contracts to define interaction rules while working collaboratively to contribute storage and computing resources. Based on the blockchain technique, our proposed model promotes trustless interaction and enhanced user's privacy through the blockchain-Interplanetary File System (IPFS) alliance. The proposed model also addresses the shortfall of storage constraints exhibited in many IoT systems.  © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programmable, decentralized and transparent financial applications. Because smart contract platforms typically support Turing-complete programming languages, such systems are often said to enable arbitrary applications. However, the current permissionless smart contract systems impose heavy restrictions on the types of computations that can be implemented. For example, the globally-replicated and sequential execution model of Ethereum requires low gas limits that make many computations infeasible. In this paper, we propose a novel system called ACE whose main goal is to enable more complex smart contracts on permissionless blockchains. ACE is based on an off-chain execution model where the contract issuers appoint a set of service providers to execute the contract code independent from the consensus layer. The primary advantage of ACE over previous solutions is that it allows one contract to safely call another contract that is executed by a different set of service providers. Thus, ACE is the first solution to enable off-chain execution of interactive smart contracts with flexible trust assumptions. Our evaluation shows that ACE enables several orders of magnitude more complex smart contracts than standard Ethereum. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

Our solution can be deployed in such a way that no human intervention is required to reach this type of agreement.

	abstract = {Since the advent of the microgrid (MG) concept, almost two decades ago, the energy sector has evolved from a centralized operational approach to a distributed generation paradigm challenged by the increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs) mainly based on renewable energy. This has encouraged new business models and management strategies looking for a balance between energy generation and consumption, and promoting an efficient utilization of energy resources within MGs and minimizing costs for the market participants. In this context, this paper introduces an efficient management strategy, which is aimed at obtaining a fair division of costs billed by the utilities, without relying on a centralized utility or MG aggregator, through the design of a local event-based energy market within the MG. This event-driven MG energy market operates with blockchain (BC) technology based on smart contracts for electricity transactions to both guarantee veracity and immutability of the data and automate the transactions. The event-based energy market approach focuses on two of the design limitations of BC, namely the amount of information to be stored and the computational burden, which are significantly reduced while maintaining a high level of performance. Furthermore, the prosumer data is obtained by using IEC 61850 standard-based commands within the BC framework. By doing so, the system is compatible with any device irrespective of the manufacturer implementing the IEC 61850 standard. The advantages of this management approach are considerable for: MG participants, in terms of financial benefits; the MG itself, as it can operate more independently from the main grid; and the grid since the MG becomes less unpredictable due to the internal energy exchanges. The proposed strategy is validated on an experimental setup employing low-cost devices.  © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the existing methodologies and approaches are time-consuming and costly and their major focus is on the SPI of Large Scale Enterprises (LSEs) therefore, we are introducing blockchain in SPI to overcome its major issues such as reliance on a central body of standardization for certification, knowledge management, high cost, resource management and change in organizational culture, etc. We have performed an exploratory case study to identify the different barriers of traditional SPI approaches. To overcome the identified issues, we have proposed and implemented a new approach by performing two case studies. The first case study was performed to identify the barriers in traditional SPI approaches and the second case study was performed to validate our proposed approach. We have performed our experiments on 55 representatives of 50 organizations. According to the results of proposed approach 56.4% of the population agreed that the SPI cost will decrease, 61.8% agreed that time of SPI will decrease and 60.3% of the population agreed that BBSPI will decrease resource utilization. Moreover, 69.1% of the population agreed with the fact that proposed BBSPI will make effective knowledge management and 83.3% of the population said that an organization can mature its processes equaliant to the central certification (CMMI, ISO) body by employing proposed BBSPI. Our results affirm that the BBSPI can reduce the time, cost, resources and helps to manage knowledge used to perform SPI. Moreover, results also depict that the BBSPI can be an efficient substitute of central bodies that could help small and medium-sized organizations to conform to common process improvement models by spending less money, time, and resources with effective knowledge management. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based voting, including liquid voting, has been extensively studied in recent years. However, it remains challenging to implement liquid voting on blockchain using Ethereum smart contract. The challenge comes from the gas limit, which is that the number of instructions for processing a ballot cannot exceed a certain amount. This restricts the application scenario with respect to algorithms whose time complexity is linear to the number of voters, i.e., O(n). As the blockchain technology can well share and reuse the resources, we study a model of liquid voting on blockchain and propose a fast algorithm, named Flash, to eliminate the restriction. The key idea behind our algorithm is to shift some on-chain process to off-chain. In detail, we first construct a Merkle tree off-chain which contains all voters' properties. Second, we use Merkle proof and interval tree to process each ballot with O(log n) on-chain time complexity. Theoretically, the algorithm can support up to 21000 voters with respect to the current gas limit on Ethereum. Experimentally, the result implies that the consumed gas fee remains at a very low level when the number of voters increases. This means our algorithm makes liquid voting on blockchain practical even for massive voters. © 2021 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers},

Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards.

	abstract = {The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) brought innovation along with unprecedented benefits of convenience and efficacy in many operations that were otherwise very cumbersome. This innovation explosion has surfaced a new dimension of vulnerability and physical threat to the data integrity of IoT networks. Implementing conventional cryptographic algorithms on IoT devices is not future‐proof as these devices are constrained in terms of computational power, performance, and memory. In this paper, we are proposing a novel framework, a unique model that integrates IoT networks with a blockchain to address potential privacy and security threats for data integrity. Smart contracts are instrumental in this integration process and they are used to handle device authentication, authorization and access‐control, and data management. We further share a new design model for interfaces to integrate both platforms while highlighting its performance results over the existing models. With the incorporation of off‐chain data storage into the framework, overall scalability of the system can be increased. Finally, our research concludes how the proposed framework can be fused virtually into any existing IoT applications with minimal modifications. © 2020 by the authors.

However, there are some major challenges, including changes in the network environment before and during task performing, and the weak connection network state faced by UAVs. Therefore, a novel task-oriented authentication model for UAVs based on blockchain (ToAM) is proposed, which divides UAVs authentication into group building authentication and intra-group authentication with a two-stage authentication framework. And two lightweight authentication protocols are presented, respectively, corresponding to two stages. Finally, analyses demonstrate that our model realizes secure and lightweight authentication function for the whole process of UAVs requisition and task performing. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain, and many smart contract vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past decade. Many security analysis tools have been created to detect such vulnerabilities, but their performance decreases drastically when codes to be analyzed are being rewritten. In this paper, we propose Eth2Vec, a machine-learning-based static analysis tool for vulnerability detection in smart contracts. It is also robust against code rewrites, i.e., it can detect vulnerabilities even in rewritten codes. Existing machine-learning-based static analysis tools for vulnerability detection need features, which analysts create manually, as inputs. In contrast, Eth2Vec automatically learns features of vulnerable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecodes with tacit knowledge through a neural network for natural language processing. Therefore, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts by comparing the code similarity between target EVM bytecodes and the EVM bytecodes it already learned. We conducted experiments with existing open databases, such as Etherscan, and our results show that Eth2Vec outperforms a recent model based on support vector machine in terms of well-known metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and F1-score.  © 2021 ACM.},

When doing so, originally constructed cryptographic signatures cannot be verified on-chain anymore. This exposes an opportunity for undetected manipulation and presents a problem for applications in the Internet of Things where trustworthy sensor data is required on-chain. In this paper, we propose trustworthy pre-processing as enabler for end-to-end sensor data integrity in data on-chaining workflows. We define requirements for trustworthy pre-processing, present a model and common workflow for data on-chaining, select off-chain computation utilizing Zero-knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as promising solution approaches, and discuss both our proof-of-concept implementations and initial experimental, comparative evaluation results.

	abstract = {Recently, Blockchain technology adoption has expanded to many application areas due to the evolution of smart contracts. However, developing smart contracts is non-trivial and challenging due to the lack of tools and expertise in this field. A promising solution to overcome this issue is to use Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), however, using models still involves a learning curve and might not be suitable for non-technical users. To tackle this challenge, chatbot or conversational interfaces can be used to assess the non-technical users to specify a smart contract in gradual and interactive manner. In this paper, we propose iContractBot, a chatbot for modeling and developing smart contracts. Moreover, we investigate how to integrate iContractBot with iContractML, a domainspecific modeling language for developing smart contracts, and instantiate intention models from the chatbot. The iContractBot framework provides a domain-specific language (DSL) based on the user intention and performs model-to-text transformation to generate the smart contract code. A smart contract use case is presented to demonstrate how iContractBot can be utilized for creating models and generating the deployment artifacts for smart contracts based on a simple conversation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this work, a secure and decentralized Blockchain based energy trading model for electric vehicles (EVs) using Smart contract that achieves Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions between EVs in Vehicle to Grid networks is designed. The traditional energy trading model is a centralized structure based on trusted third parties, and there may an issue of single-point failure and leakage of privacy. In this way, a blockchain-based framework offers a secure, efficient and transparent trading model. Initially, the participating EVs and aggregator in the trading process should register at the trusted authority. Once the registration is successfully completed, both EVs and aggregator authenticate each other mutually in an anonymous manner. Moreover, only authorized EVs (charging and discharging EVs) participate in the contrary auction mechanism to exchange power/money based on their demand. Simulation conducted for the proposed scheme shows that our scheme has high speed (i.e., less computational time and execution time) which improves the market efficiency. In-addition, the transactions are non tamperable, when compared to the conventional scheme.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {By law, schools are required to protect the well-being of students against problems such as on-campus bullying and physical abuse. In the UK, a report by the Office for Education (OfE) showed 17% of young people had been bullied during 2017–2018. This problem continues to prevail with consequences including depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders. Additionally, recent evidence suggests this type of victimisation could intensify existing health complications. This study investigates the opportunities provided by Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data towards next-generation safeguarding. A new model is developed based on blockchain technology to enable real-time intervention triggered by IoMT data that can be used to detect stressful events, e.g., when bullying takes place. The model utilises private permissioned blockchain to manage IoMT data to achieve quicker and better decision-making while revolutionising aspects related to compliance, double-entry, confidentiality, and privacy. The feasibility of the model and the interaction between the sensors and the blockchain was simulated. To facilitate a close approximation of an actual IoMT environment, we clustered and decomposed existing medical sensors to their attributes, including their function, for a variety of scenarios. Then, we demonstrated the performance and capabilities of the emulator under different loads of sensor-generated data. We argue to the suitability of this emulator for schools and medical centres to conduct feasibility studies to address sensor data with disruptive data processing and management technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {—Due to the increasing complexity of supply chains over the past years, many factors significantly contribute to lowering the supply chains performance. Poor visibility is one of the major challenging factors that lowers supply chains performance. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based supply chain network model to improve the supply chain visibility. The model focuses in improving the visibility measurements properties: information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility. The proposed model consists of information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility platforms based on Blockchain technology smart contract. The model built with Hyperledger platform and extend the Hyperledger Composer Supply Chain Network (HCSC) model. The research is designed to three main phases. First phase: the preliminary phase which is the literature review phase to identify the existing challenges in the domain. The second phase: the design and implementation phase which is the development steps of the proposed research model. The third phase: the evaluation phase which represent the performance evaluation of the proposed model and the comparisons between the proposed model and the existing models. In the evaluation performance, the common performance metrics Lead time and average inventory levels will be compared in the proposed model, Cloud-based information system, and the traditional supply chain. These proposed platforms offer an end-to-end visibility of products, orders, and stock levels for supply chain practitioners and customers within supply chain networks. Which helps managers’ access key information that support critical business decisions and offers essential criteria for competitiveness and therefore, enhance supply chain performance. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the lives of millions of people worldwide. With an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases, it is important to detect and diagnose COVID-19 in its early stages to prevent its spread. To diagnose remote patients, the Internet can be useful for accessing data of that patient. But, the Internet has also had issues related to data security, reliability, and privacy. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain (BC) based COVID-19 detection scheme (BCovX) for fast and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. For fast and accurate detection of COVID-19 using CXR, BCovX consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using which a patient can be diagnosed for COVID-19 remotely. CNNs have performed successfully in medical imaging classification. BCovX provides reliable and secure data access and exchange using BC and smart contracts (SC). To solve issues related to data storage and its associated cost, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol is used to store medical data. We also present a real-time SC developed in Solidity to govern the transaction between the patient and the doctor. The SC has been compiled and deployed on Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Finally, we have evaluated the performance of BCovX with traditional schemes in terms of storage cost, bandwidth requirements, and accuracy of the CNN model. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is a list of data blocks as a publicly distributed ledger, which are linked together using cryptography. By allowing Turing-complete programming languages to implement smart contracts, recent blockchains such as Ethereum can reduce needs in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs. However, subtle errors in smart contracts have induced an enormous financial loss-for examples, the DAO attack, Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and integer underflow/overflow attacks. To identify such errors in smart contracts, various researches are performed, which are based on static analysis and theorem proving. However, they only support inspection for pre-defined error patterns, or they cannot explore the whole searching space exhaustively or be fully automatic. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel formal verification technique to analyze blockchain smart contracts by using ATL model checking. In our methodology, we represent the interaction between users and smart contracts into a two-player game and verify properties we want to check using MCMAS that is an efficient ATL model checker for multi-agent systems. Moreover, we present three case studies to show that our proposal can successfully identify subtle flaws in real world smart contracts.

This change diversifies the attacker’s attack vectors, increasing the impact and damage of cyber threats. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) technology is a proof-based security system which responds to these advanced cyber threats proactively by analyzing and sharing security-related data. However, the performance of CTI systems can be significantly compromised by creating and disseminating improper security policies if an attacker intentionally injects malicious data into the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI framework that improves confidence in the source and content of the data and can quickly detect and eliminate inaccurate data for resistance to a Sybil attack. The proposed framework collects CTI by a procedure validated through smart contracts and stores information about the metainformation of data in a blockchain network. The proposed system ensures the validity and reliability of CTI data by ensuring traceability to the data source and proposes a system model that can efficiently operate and manage CTI data in compliance with the de facto standard.

However, current explorations still face challenges to prove that the off-chain SLO (Service Level Objective) violations really happen before recorded into the on-chain transactions. In this paper, a witness model is proposed implemented with smart contracts to solve this trust issue. The introduced role, “Witness”, gains rewards as an incentive for performing the SLO violation report, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that the witness has to tell the truth, for maximizing the rewards. This fact that the witness has to be honest is analyzed and proved using the Nash Equilibrium principle of game theory. For ensuring the chosen witnesses are random and independent, an unbiased selection algorithm is proposed to avoid possible collusions. An auditing mechanism is also introduced to detect potential malicious witnesses. Specifically, we define three types of malicious behaviors and propose quantitative indicators to audit and detect these behaviors. Moreover, experimental studies based on Ethereum blockchain demonstrate the proposed model is feasible, and indicate that the performance, ie, transaction fee, of each interface follows the design expectations. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {A smart contract is the algorithmic description of a contractual transaction protocol that is automatically executed together with the information provided by its parties. It is written in a simplified programming language that is specific to a particular domain. Not only correctness and unambiguity are its essential formal properties, but also conformance to any legislation governing the matter of the transaction. Finally, and importantly, the trustworthiness, safety and security of the platform executing the transactions are its main attributes. An emerging challenge is to define a proper engineering process to meet the demanding requirements while supporting mass production and distribution. This paper proposes the concept of smart contract engineering (SCE) to facilitate the generation of smart legal contracts, which is the combination of software engineering, formal methods and computational law. SCE aims to reduce the potential errors and improve efficiency during the contract development process, meanwhile promote the standardization of contract design methodologies. In this paper, the roadmap of an iterative refinement-based, model-driven formal design methodology is introduced, not only to validate smart contracts but also to support the whole life cycle of their engineering. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The growing adoption of Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) systems, particularly in the healthcare field, demonstrates that RFID is a positive asset for healthcare institutions. RFID offers the ability to save organizations time and costs by enabling data of traceability, identification, communication, temperature and location in real time for both people and resources. However, the RFID systems challenges are financial, technical, organizational and above all privacy and security. For this reason, recent works focus on attribute-based access control (ABAC) schemes. Currently, ABAC are based on mostly centralized models, which in environments such as the supply chain can present problems of scalability, synchronization and trust between the parties. In this manuscript, we implement an ABAC model in RFID systems based on a decentralized model such as blockchain. Common criteria for the selection of the appropriate blockchain are detailed. Our access control policies are executed through the decentralized application (DApp), which interfaces with the blockchain through the smart contract. Smart contracts and blockchain technology, on the one hand, solve current centralized systems issues as well as being flexible infrastructures that represent the relationship of trust and support essential in the ABAC model in order to provide the security of RFID systems. Our system has been designed for a supply chain environment with an use case suitable for healthcare systems, so that assets such as surgical instruments containing an associated RFID tag can only access to specific areas. Our system is deployed in both a local and Testnet environment in order to stablish a deep comparison and determining the technical feasibility. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain is an innovative technology that disrupts different industries and offers decentralized, secure, and immutable platforms. Its first appearance is connected with monetary cryptocurrency transactions, followed by adaptation in several domains. We believe that blockchain can provide a reliable environment by utilizing its unique characteristics to offer a more secure, costless, and robust mechanism suitable for a voting application. Although the technology has captured the interest of governments worldwide, blockchain as a service is still limited due to lack of application development experience, technology complexity, and absence of standardized design, architecture, and best practices. Therefore, this study aims to build an imperial example for a blockchain electronic voting (e-voting) application using digital identity management for fulfilling immutable, transparent, and secure distributed blockchain features. The paper reviews the current types of e-voting systems and discusses the standard processes. We propose a conceptual design for a blockchain providing a digital identity management service to secure the e-voting application results. The blockchain development process implemented in this study follows the Proof of Concept to verify the e-voting application’s function for illustrating the architecture and description of the application’s business process model. The development is based on the Ethereum platform, which allows the implementation of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. The developed e-voting application saves time, requires fewer processes, and results in higher accuracy, more transparency, considerable voters’ privacy, and accountable system management. We expect that the e-voting blockchain application will impact governmental processes during the election, reduce spending, support digital transformation, and ensure fairness of results. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {As smart contracts are growing in size and complexity, it becomes harder and harder to ensure their correctness and security. Due to the lack of isolation mechanisms a single mistake or vulnerability in the code can bring the whole system down, and due to this smart contract upgrades can be especially dangerous. Traditional ways to ensure the security of a smart contract, including DSLs, auditing and static analysis, are used before the code is deployed to the blockchain, and thus offer no protection after the deployment. After each upgrade the whole code need to be verified again, which is a difficult and time-consuming process that is prone to errors. To address these issues a security protocol and framework for smart contracts called Cap9 was developed. It provides developers the ability to perform upgrades in a secure and robust manner, and improves isolation and transparency through the use of a low level capability-based security model. We have used Isabelle/HOL to develop a formal specification of the Cap9 framework and prove its consistency. The paper presents a refinement-based approach that we used to create the specification, as well as discussion of some encountered difficulties during this process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated. c© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

IIoT is a major driving force for Industry 4.0, which heavily utilizes machine learning (ML) to capitalize on the massive interconnection and large volumes of IIoT data. However, ML models that are trained on sensitive data tend to leak privacy to adversarial attacks, limiting its full potential in Industry 4.0. This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer.

IoT is increasingly becoming an essential part of the homes and industrial automation; nevertheless, there are still many challenges that need to fix. IoT solutions are costly and complicated, while issues regarding security and privacy must be addressed with a sustainable plan. Support the growing number of connected devices; the IoT is in dire need of a reboot. Blockchain technology might be the answer. Starting as a decentralized financial solution in the form of Bitcoin, Blockchain technology has expanded to diverse areas and Information Technology applications. Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts can address the outstanding security and privacy issues that impede further development of the IoT. Blockchain is a decentralized system with no central governance, facilitates interactions, promotes new and improved transaction models, and allows autonomous coordination of the devices using enhanced encryption techniques. The primary reason for this paper is to showcase the challenges and problems we are facing with the current internet of things solutions and analyze how the use of Blockchain and Smart Contracts can help achieve a new, more robust internet of things system. Finally, we examine some of the many projects using the Internet of Things together with Blockchain and Smart Contracts, to create new solutions that are only possible by integrating these technologies. © Science and Information Organization.},

	abstract = {The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this paper, we revisit the predominant offline contract-driven mobile data access model enabling users to gain access to the infrastructure of only a few network operators and propose a new blockchain-backed mobile data access model where the key 5G stakeholders can trade, share and consume mobile edge network assets (access to the internet, spectrum, processing, storage, local content etc.) in a fully decentralized, anonymous and highly-robust fashion. Blockchain-backed mobile data access should address critical practical challenges of blockchain decentralization, scalability and security in the context of 5G and Beyond networks. Accordingly, we provide a meticulous survey of existing solutions in the aforementioned three areas and present a comprehensive holistic framework of protocols to address the key challenges identified, including a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for distributed blockchain consensus over 5G and Beyond mobile data networks, a future-proof smart-contract enabled payment relay service enabling instant off-chain payments in a highly robust fashion as well as a hybrid mixing protocol that enables payment relays to act as anonymous payment hubs while addressing the unique challenges opposed by the joint blockchain and network level interaction of the 5G and Beyond service components. A wide range of practical implications and mitigation measures for dishonest operation of the blockchain nodes are investigated and sophisticated yet highly-robust incentive engineering mechanisms are derived. Detailed numerical results also accompany the paper, bringing to light the unique performance trade-offs and valuable design guidelines towards blockchain-backed mobile data access for 5G and Beyond mobile data networks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed key generation (DKG) is widely used in multi-party computation and decentralized applications. DKG has two phases, namely sharing and reconstruction. Most of the prior DKG protocols need at least 2 rounds for the sharing phase, in case some party raises a dispute. The existing 1-round DKG protocol [Fouque et al., PKC'01], built based on a publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme, assumes a static adversary model and its reconstruction phase requires O(n^{2}) communication complexity. Motivated by the observation that a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme hides secret sharing (SS) in ciphertext, we utilize decentralized CP-ABE to achieve the first adaptively secure 1-round DKG protocol. Firstly, a CP-ABE scheme enables the ciphertexts in DKG to be externally decrypted, making our protocol superior to the PVSS-based DKG protocol in reconstruction. The communication and computation complexities are both lowered to O(n) thanks to the constant-sized decryption key and the proposed batch decryption. The use of CP-ABE also makes our DKG protocol storage-friendly, i.e., the parties store no ciphertext after the sharing phase. Secondly, we add non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs to make the CP-ABE ciphertext publicly verifiable by leveraging the sigma protocol and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Thirdly, we demonstrate our protocol's feasibility by presenting a proof-of-concept implementation over Ethereum, which is used as a public channel and a trustworthy computation platform. The implementation is a non-trivial task due to Ethereum's incompatibility with the bilinear mapping group. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

How to improve the applicability and scientific nature of electric vehicle charging is an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes an intelligent scheduling access model for electric vehicles based on blockchain. Firstly, the layout simplification calculation is carried out for the layout of the traditional distributed power grid. Then, a data storage and consensus system is built using blockchain smart contracts to ensure that all historical data are not tampered with and are traceable. Finally, the model forms an electricity price guidance model in the intelligent scheduling and access of electric vehicles, optimizes the multivehicle line congestion in operation, and can dynamically schedule and correct the model. In terms of the experiment, 13 test electric vehicles were dispatched based on 12 real power station nodes and 36 test nodes of Yunnan Power Grid Co. Information Center for verification. The result analysis shows that the model can effectively and quickly solve the blocking and unblocking of the Internet of Vehicles and can develop a scheduling scheme conforming to the safety constraints of electric vehicles in a relatively short time.  © 2021 Cheng Xu et al.},

The authentication of ANs and SNs is performed in public and private blockchains, respectively. However, inauthentic nodes utilize the network’s resources and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the SNs have limited energy, transmission range and computational capabilities, and are attacked by malicious nodes. Afterwards, the malicious nodes transmit wrong information of the route and increase the number of retransmissions due to which the SNs’ energy is rapidly consumed. The lifespan of the wireless sensor network is reduced due to the rapid energy dissipation of the SNs. Furthermore, the throughput increases and packet loss increase with the presence of malicious nodes in the network. The trust values of SNs are computed to eradicate the malicious nodes from the network. Secure routing in the network is performed considering residual energy and trust values of the SNs. Moreover, the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), a cryptosystem that provides asymmetric keys, is used for securing data transmission. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high packet delivery ratio. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Due to the obvious privacy issues of deep learning, Google proposes Federal Deep Learning (FDL), in which distributed participants only upload local gradients and and a centralized server updates parameters based on the collected gradients. But few users are willing to participate in federated learning due to the lack of contribution evaluation and reward mechanisms. So a decentralized federated deep learning, called DFDL, has been proposed by introducing blockchain to form an effective incentive mechanism for participants. However, DFDL still faces serious privacy issues as blockchain does not guarantee the privacy of training data and model. In this paper, in order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a new Privacy-preserving DFDL scheme, called PDFDL. With PDFDL, parties can securely learn a global model with their local gradients in the assistance of blockchain, and the parties' sensitive data and the global model are well protected. Specifically, with a secure multi-party aggregation computing, all local gradients are encrypted by their owners before being sent to the smart contract, and can be directly aggregated without decryption. Detailed security analysis shows that PDFDL can resist various known security threats. Moreover, we give an implementation prototype by integrating deep learning module with a Blockchain development platform (Ethereum V1.6.4). We demonstrate the encryption performance and the training accuracy of our PDFDL on benchmark datasets. © 2021 ACM.},

From research and practice, we observe two main paradigms of how organizations interact with blockchain. First, organizations use blockchain to optimize existing processes (blockchain-based business process optimization (BPO)). Second, organizations use blockchain to disrupt existing processes, foster disintermediation, and enable disruptive business models (blockchain-based business process disruption (BPD)). However, we lack scientific research that evaluates its de facto potential. We bridge this gap by following a design science research approach to design blockchain-based business process re-engineering (BPRE) for a letter of credit that combines the advantages of BPO and BPD. We conduct three design cycles and develop three artefacts: a BPO, a BPD, and a BPRE approach. Our BPRE approach combines the advantages of partial disintermediation (i.e., increased efficiency and transparency) with the advantages of intermediaries (i.e., process flexibility, liquidity provision, and dispute mediation). © 2021 by the Association for Information Systems.},

Data sharing among distributed medical institutions is already a development trend. However, the security is worrying; e.g., the access to medical data lacks uniformity and standardization. What is more, data is easy to be tampered with and leaked. This has a very negative impact on the medical industry. Therefore, a strict and reliable access control mechanism for data in the medical cyber physical systems is a prerequisite for ensuring the implementation of modern medical functions. We deal with how to design effective access control in medical cyber physical systems. Combined with blockchain technology, we design the medical cyber physical systems based on blockchain data access control mechanism and unite data in the chain of union Fabric network resources access control. We qualitatively classify medical data, define the weight level of different data, design a medical data access framework based on blockchain, build an applicable model, formulate access control strategy, and specify the role assignment and access task matching of users, so as to achieve secure and effective data access control. The Hyperledger Fabric network is established as the alliance chain for managing access control rights distribution through smart contracts so as to achieve case-based medical data access control under the blockchain.  © 2021 Fulong Chen et al.},

However, the classical consensus method of blockchain, that is, Proof-of-Work, as implemented in Bitcoin, has a significant impact on energy consumption and compromises the scalability, efficiency, and latency of the system. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consensus model (PSC-Bchain) composed of Proof of Credibility and Proof of Stake that work mutually to address the aforementioned problems to secure e-voting systems. Smart contracts are used to provide a trustworthy public bulletin board and a secure computing environment to ensure the accuracy of the ballot outcome. We combine a sharding mechanism with the PSC-Bchain hybrid approach to emphasize security, thus enhancing the scalability and performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system. Furthermore, we compare and discuss the execution of attacks on the classical blockchain and our proposed hybrid blockchain, and analyze the security.

The initial adoption of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for continued use of the services, but their user acceptance behavioral model has not been well investigated in the literature. In this paper, we take the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a foundation and extend the external constructs to uncover how the perceived ease of use, perceived usability, quality of the system and perceived enjoyment influence the intention to use the blockchain-based system. We based our study on user evaluation of a prototype of a blockchain-based research data sharing framework using a TAM validated questionnaire. Our results show that, overall, all the individual constructs of the behavior model significantly influence the intention to use the system while their collective effect is found to be insignificant. The quality of the system and the perceived enjoyment have stronger influence on the perceived usefulness. However, the effect of perceived ease of use on the perceived usefulness is not supported. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emergence of smart contracts has increased the attention of industry and academia to blockchain technology, which is tamper-proofing, decentralized, autonomous, and enables decentralized applications to operate in untrustworthy environments. However, these features of this technology are also easily exploited by unscrupulous individuals, a typical example of which is the Ponzi scheme in Ethereum. The negative effect of unscrupulous individuals writing Ponzi scheme-type smart contracts in Ethereum and then using these contracts to scam large amounts of money has been significant. To solve this problem, we propose a detection model for detecting Ponzi schemes in smart contracts using bytecode. In this model, our innovation is shown in two aspects: We first propose to use two bytes as one characteristic, which can quickly transform the bytecode into a high-dimensional matrix, and this matrix contains all the implied characteristics in the bytecode. Then, We innovatively transformed the Ponzi schemes detection into an anomaly detection problem. Finally, an anomaly detection algorithm is used to identify Ponzi schemes in smart contracts. Experimental results show that the proposed detection model can greatly improve the accuracy of the detection of the Ponzi scheme contracts. Moreover, the F1-score of this model can reach 0.88, which is far better than those of other traditional detection models. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts (SCs) and collaborative learning (CL) are disclosed publicly, in which most transactions and activities that occur by the parties can be bared in real-time. Both are strengthened in a decentralized manner. CL allows numerous clients to collectively build deep learning models privately by aggregating the gradient values from clients' devices, yet it lacks the incentive mechanism for the contributing clients. On the other hand, the merits of SCs can be a plausible solution as an incentive mechanism in the CL system because self-executing contracts with immutable data records are resistant to failure. The clients can claim the rewards by stating their contribution arbitrarily in the SCs and tendering a proof transaction function. Nevertheless, directly adopting SCs in the CL system could breach clients' privacy because the transactions are exposed openly. The observer can infer the properties of the clients' resources. Therefore, we designed schemes that can overcome observers' ability to link clients' information with their associated devices during training. In essence, our schemes are unbiased. We also provide a secure incentive mechanism for the parties in the CL system by obscuring the information values. Finally, the numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes satisfy the design goals.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Towards this goal, we study a blockchain-aided EC market wherein each data service operator (DSO) rents a group of edge computing nodes (ECNs) and leases the ECNs to the user terminals (UTs) to provide computation offloading services. First, we propose a smart contract based matching mechanism to establish the renting association between the DSOs and ECNs with the aim of maximizing the social welfare. Second, we propose a social welfare improved double auction (SWIDA) mechanism to build up the leasing association between the DSOs and UTs, and show that the proposed mechanism can achieve individual rationality, balanced budget, truthfulness in expectation, and an improved social welfare than the benchmark mechanisms. Moreover, we put forth a trustworthiness-driven Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to enable verified transaction and fair reward allocation. We formulate the block generation as a coalitional game, wherein each stakeholder votes according to its trustworthiness and coinage, and shares the reward among the coalition according to the Shapley values. The simulation results show that the proposed PoS consensus mechanism can reduce the wealth inequality among the network entities. IEEE},

	abstract = {The increasing number of rice product safety issues and the potential for contamination have established an enormous need for an effective strategy for thetraceability of the rice supply chain. Tracing the origins of a rice product from rawmaterials to end customers is very complex and costly. Existing food supply chainmethods (for example, rice) do not provide a scalable and cost-effective means ofagricultural food supply. Besides, consumers lack the capability and resourcesrequired to check or report on the quality of agricultural goods in terms of defects orcontamination. Consequently, customers are forced to decide whether to utilize ordiscard the goods. However, blockchain is an innovative framework capable ofoffering a transformative solution for the traceability of agricultural products andfood supply chains. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework capable oftracking and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholdersin the rice chain ecosystem through smart contracts. The model incorporates asystem for customer satisfaction feedback, which enables all stakeholders to getup-to-date information on product quality, enabling them to make more informedsupply chain decisions. Each transaction is documented and stored in the publicledger of the blockchain. The proposed framework provides a safe, efficient, reliable,and effective way to monitor and track rice products safety and quality especiallyduring product purchasing.

The amount of transaction fee depends on the size of that contract and the operations executed by that contract. Consequently, smart contracts with inefficient code will waste money. In this article, we propose and develop the first tool, named GasChecker, for automatically identifying gas-inefficient code in smart contracts, and conduct the first empirical study on the prevalence of gas-inefficient code in the deployed smart contracts. More precisely, we first summarize ten gas-inefficient programming patterns and propose a new approach based on symbolic execution (SE) to detect them in the bytecode of smart contracts. To make our approach scalable to analyze millions of smart contracts, we parallelize SE by tailoring it to the MapReduce programming model, and propose a new feedback-based load balancing strategy to effectively utilize cloud resources. Extensive experiments show that GasChecker scales well with the increase of workers. The empirical study demonstrates that lots of real smart contracts contain various inefficient code. Manual investigation demonstrates that only 2.5 percent of discovered gas-inefficient instances are false positives.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Ethereum, which uses blockchain technology, is a distributed computing platform and operating system. Smart contracts are small programs deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. Errors in smart contracts will lead to huge losses. Formal verification can provide a reliable guarantee for the security of blockchain smart contracts. In this paper, the formal method is applied to inspect the security issues of smart contracts. We summarize five kinds of security issues in smart contracts and present formal verification methods for these issues, thus establishing a formal verification framework that can effectively verify the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. Furthermore, we present a complete formal verification of the Binance Coin (BNB) contract. It shows how to formally verify the above security issues based on the formal verification framework in a specific smart contract. All the proofs are checked formally using the Coq proof assistant in which contract model and specification are formalized. The formal work of this paper has a variety of essential applications, such as the verification of blockchain smart contracts, program verification, and the formal establishment of mathematical and computer theoretical foundations. © 2020 by the authors.

In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Now-a-days, the Internet of Things (IoT) has generated enormous interest from industry to create distributed and innovative solutions. However, achieving this goal is a tedious task and presents several open challenges as the literature points out. One of the most complex is the IoT coordination service. Unfortunately, most research works give rarely importance to this service in their models or architectures proposals. Wherefore our current contribution deals with this open issue and proposes a solution capable of implementing advanced processes that can be based on orchestration, choreography or both mechanisms. More over and to conduct efficiently both coordination mechanisms when sharing knowledge or tasks between connected objects, we integrate smart contacts to guarantee the modalities of behavior change in the coordination mechanism. Smart contracts are a safe way to decide the coordination mechanism based on the state of the system environment. To prove our approach, we have built a technical architecture based on a multi-agent system to abstract connected objects of IoT systems, blockchain technology, and the frameworks and languages required for collaboration processes such as BPMN, BPEL and BPEL4CHOR.

	abstract = {Data sharing techniques have progressively drawn increasing attention as a means of significantly reducing repetitive work. However, in the process of data sharing, the challenges regarding formation of mutual-trust relationships and increasing the level of user participation are yet to be solved. The existing solution is to use a third party as a trust organization for data sharing, but there is no dynamic incentive mechanism for data sharing with a large number of users. Blockchain 2.0 with smart contract has the natural advantage of being able to enable trust and automated transactions between a large number of users. This paper proposes a data sharing incentive model based on evolutionary game theory using blockchain with smart contract. The smart contract mechanism can dynamically control the excitation parameters and continuously encourages users to participate in data sharing. © 2020},

	abstract = {With the increasing number of cybercrimes, the digital forensics team has no choice but to implement more robust and resilient evidence-handling mechanisms. The capturing of digital evidence, which is a tangible and probative piece of information that can be presented in court and used in trial, is very challenging due to its volatility and improper handling procedures. When computer systems get compromised, digital forensics comes into play to analyze, discover, extract, and preserve all relevant evidence. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain efficient evidence management to guarantee the credibility and admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law. A critical component of this process is to utilize an adequate chain of custody (CoC) approach to preserve the evidence in its original state from compromise and/or contamination. In this paper, a practical and secure CustodyBlock (CB) model using private blockchain protocol and smart contracts to support the control, transfer, analysis, and preservation monitoring is proposed. The smart contracts in CB are utilized to enhance the model automation process for better and more secure evidence preservation and handling. A further research direction in terms of implementing blockchain-based evidence management ecosystems, and the implications on other different areas, are discussed. © 2021 by the author.

Each patent office in a country or region manages a peer node of the system, reaching agreements of all the applications. First, we build the model of the system and detail the three-layer architecture of PABC Core. Then, we implement PABC on a permissioned blockchain platform &#x2014; Hyperledger Fabric.

	abstract = {Smart contract-enabled blockchains allow building decentralized applications in which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle services emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds. Unfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under what is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side and showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered collaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart contract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative attack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all previous works required a technique to quantify an attacker’s individual contribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our framework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless collaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the attack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform the attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers’ interaction as a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in proportion to the amount of their bets in the game’s unique equilibrium. We also model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and prove that it is a strategy-proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This paper considers a federated learning system consisting of a central aggregation server and multiple distributed local workers, all having access to trusted execution environments (TEEs). For the local workers, which are untrusted but economically-rational, to conduct local learning honestly, we propose a TEE-based selective testing scheme that also combines techniques from applied cryptography, game theory and smart contract. Theoretical analysis of the scheme indicates that only a small number of tests are needed to enforce honest execution by the local workers. Implementation-based experiments compare the cost of the proposed scheme against two reference schemes (i.e., the original scheme without security measure and the all-SGX scheme which conducts training completely in an SGX enclave). The results show that, our proposed scheme incurs much lower cost at the SGX enclave though introducing a higher cost at the untrusted execution environment. We argue that this tradeoff is appropriate given that computing in the untrusted environment can access more resources and is cheaper than in the trusted environment. The experiment results also show that, the increase of the cost in the untrusted execution environment get smaller as the size of the training model increases, which demonstrates the scalability of the scheme.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Construction projects usually involve signing various contracts with specific billing proce-dures. In practice, dealing with complex contract structures causes significant problems, especially with regard to timely payment and guaranteed cash flow. Furthermore, a lack of transparency leads to a loss of trust. As a result, late or non-payment is a common problem in the construction industry. This paper presents the concept of implementing smart contracts for automated, transparent, and traceable payment processing for construction projects. Automated billing is achieved by combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) approaches with blockchain-based smart contracts. Thereby, parts of traditional construction contracts are transferred to a smart contract. The smart contract is set up using digital BIM-based tender documents and contains all of the relevant data for financial transactions. Once the contracted construction work has been accepted by the client, payments can be made automatically via authorized financial institutions. This paper describes the framework, referred to as BIMcontracts, the container-based data exchange, and the digital contract management workflow. It discusses the industry-specific requirements for blockchain and data storage and explains which technical and software architectural decisions were made. A case study is used to demonstrate the current implementation of the concept. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In the current digital era, information exchanges can be done easily through the Internet and social media. However, the actual truth of the news on social media platforms is hard to prove, and social media platforms are susceptible to the spreading of hoaxes. As a remedy, Blockchain technology can be used to ensure the reliability of shared information and can create a trusted communications environment. In this study, we propose a social media news spreading model by adapting an epidemic methodology and a scale-free network. A Blockchain-based news verification system is implemented to identify the credibility of the news and its sources. The effectiveness of the model is investigated by utilizing agent-based modelling using NetLogo software. In the simulations, fake news with a truth level of 20% are assigned a low News Credibility Indicator (NCI ±-0.637) value for all of the different network dimensions. Moreover, the Producer Reputation Credit is also decreased (PRC ± 0.213) so that the trust factor value is reduced. Our epidemic approach for news verification has also been implemented using Ethereum Smart Contract and several tools such as React with Solidity, IPFS, Web3.js, and Metamask. By showing the measurements of the credibility indicator and reputation credit to the user during the news dissemination process, this proposed smart contract can effectively limit user behaviour in spreading fake news and improve the content quality on social media. © 2021, IICM.

Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between blockchains.

In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate new large-scale production blockchains. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {With increased awareness comes unprecedented expectations. We live in a digital, cloud era wherein the underlying information architectures are expected to be elastic, secure, resilient, and handle petabyte scaling. The expectation of epic proportions from the next generation of the data frameworks is to not only do all of the above but also build it on a foundation of trust and explainability across multi-organization business networks. From cloud providers to automobile industries or even vaccine manufacturers, components are often sourced by a complex, not full digitized thread of disjoint suppliers. Building Machine Learning and AI-based order fulfillment and predictive models, remediating issues, is a challenge for multi-organization supply chain automation. We posit that Federated Learning in conjunction with blockchain and smart contracts are technologies primed to tackle data privacy and centralization challenges. In this paper, motivated by challenges in the industry, we propose a decentralized distributed system in conjunction with a recommendation system model (Matrix Factorization) that is trained using Federated Learning on an Ethereum blockchain network. We leverage smart contracts that allow decentralized serverless aggregation to update local-ized items vectors. Furthermore, we utilize Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to allow sharing the encrypted gradients over the network while maintaining their privacy. Based on our results, we argue that training a model over a serverless Blockchain network using smart contracts will provide the same accuracy as in a centralized model while maintaining our serverless model privacy and reducing the overhead communication to a central server. Finally, we assert such a system that provides transparency, audit-ready and deep insights into supply chain operations for enterprise cloud customers resulting in cost savings and higher Quality of Service (QoS). © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Access control is a technology that can guarantee the security of information in network transmission, in which role-based access control is to separate the subject from the permission, and to assign the permission by distributing the corresponding role of the user. However, the traditional role-based access control scheme is generally centralized, the allocation of user's role lacks fine granularity, and there is static in the allocation of the role and permission, which is not consistent with the distributed and dynamic network architecture nowadays. Hence, we propose a dynamic and fine-grained role-based access control model DF-RBAC, which can realize the flexible assignment of roles by resource owners and security verification of assigned roles. Further, we take advantage of blockchain technology and cryptography technology to combine with the DF-RBAC framework to achieve access to the activity log security audit function, which can ensure the security of the overall architecture.

	abstract = {Ride-sharing is a service that enables drivers to share trips with other riders, contributing to appealing benefits of shared travel cost and reducing traffic congestion. However, the majority of existing ride-sharing services rely on a central third party to organize the service, which make them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure concerns by both internal and external attackers. Moreover, they are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks launched by malicious users and external attackers. Besides, high service fees are paid to the ride-sharing service provider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based on public Blockchain, named B-Ride. B-Ride enables drivers to offer ride-sharing services without relying on a trusted third party. Both riders and drivers can learn whether they can share rides while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location, departure/arrival date and travel price. However, malicious users exploit the anonymity provided by the public blockchain to submit multiple ride requests or offers, while not committing to any of them, in order to find a better offer or to make the system unreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit protocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set membership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their good will and commitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove to the blockchain on the agreed pick-up time that he/she arrived at the pick-up location on time. To preserve rider/driver privacy by hiding the exact pick-up location, the proof is performed using zero-knowledge set membership proof. Moreover, to ensure fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is introduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and rider. In addition, we introduce a reputation model to rate drivers based on their past behaviour without involving any third-parties to allow riders to select them based on their history on the system. Finally, we implement our protocol and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experimental results show the applicability of our protocol atop existing real-world blockchains. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of the Internet, the domain name system (DNS) as infrastructure is playing an increasingly important role. However, traditional DNS architecture is centralized, and there are some security problems such as the right concentration and power abuse. This paper combines blockchain technology with DNS technology and proposes a domain name service model based on the permissioned blockchain. At first, this paper designs a top-level domain chain (TLDChain) model to conduct consensus on block transactions and achieve decentralization of domain name service. Then, this paper introduces a data model to upload data. At the same time, to improve the efficiency of the blockchain data query, this paper proposes a data warehouse to speed up the query. Also, it designs the domain name data synchronization algorithm and consistency checking algorithm to achieve synchronization and quick consistency checking of domain name data. At last, this paper introduces the domain name resolution process of this model. Experimental results show that the proposed DNS service model not only realizes the decentralization of domain name resolution but also improves query efficiency. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {With opportunities brought by the Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to maintain concurrency and privacy when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices are involved. Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user’s environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system’s performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {We present a static analysis approach that combines concrete values and symbolic expressions. This symbolic value-flow ("symvalic") analysis models program behavior with high precision, e.g., full path sensitivity. To achieve deep modeling of program semantics, the analysis relies on a symbiotic relationship between a traditional static analysis fixpoint computation and a symbolic solver: the solver does not merely receive a complex "path condition"to solve, but is instead invoked repeatedly (often tens or hundreds of thousands of times), in close cooperation with the flow computation of the analysis. The result of the symvalic analysis architecture is a static modeling of program behavior that is much more complete than symbolic execution, much more precise than conventional static analysis, and domain-agnostic: no special-purpose definition of anti-patterns is necessary in order to compute violations of safety conditions with high precision. We apply the analysis to the domain of Ethereum smart contracts. This domain represents a fundamental challenge for program analysis approaches: despite numerous publications, research work has not been effective at uncovering vulnerabilities of high real-world value. In systematic comparison of symvalic analysis with past tools, we find significantly increased completeness (shown as 83-96% statement coverage and more true error reports) combined with much higher precision, as measured by rate of true positive reports. In terms of real-world impact, since the beginning of 2021, the analysis has resulted in the discovery and disclosure of several critical vulnerabilities, over funds in the many millions of dollars. Six separate bug bounties totaling over $350K have been awarded for these disclosures.  © 2021 Owner/Author.},

Blockchain technology, as a distributed and decentralized ledger, is a potential solution to tackle the limitations of the current peer-to-peer IoT networks. This paper presents the development of an integrated IoT system implementing the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to secure the edge computing devices by employing a local authentication process. In addition, the proposed model provides traceability for the data generated by the IoT devices. The presented solution also addresses the IoT systems' scalability challenges, the processing power and storage issues of the IoT edge devices in the blockchain network. A set of built-in queries is leveraged by smart-contracts technology to define the rules and conditions. The paper validates the performance of the proposed model with practical implementation by measuring performance metrics such as transaction throughput and latency, resource consumption, and network use. The results show that the proposed platform with the HLF implementation is promising for the security of resource-constrained IoT devices and is scalable for deployment in various IoT scenarios.},

These devices sense a considerable amount of sensitive data processed by a centralized third party. While many researchers have thoroughly evaluated privacy issues surrounding wearable fitness trackers, no study has addressed privacy issues in trackers by giving control of the data to the user. Blockchain is an emerging technology with outstanding advantages in resolving consent management privacy concerns. As there are no fully transparent, legally compliant solutions for sharing personal fitness data, this study introduces an architecture for a human-centric, legally compliant, decentralized and dynamic consent system based on blockchain and smart contracts. Algorithms and sequence diagrams of the proposed system's activities show consent-related data flow among various agents, which are used later to prove the system's trustworthiness by formalizing the security requirements. The security properties of the proposed system were evaluated using the formal security modeling framework SeMF, which demonstrates the feasibility of the solution at an abstract level based on formal language theory. As a result, we have shown that blockchain technology is suitable for mitigating the privacy issues of fitness providers by recording individuals' consent using blockchain and smart contracts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The combination of renewable energy sources and prosumer-based smart grid is a sustainable solution to cater to the problem of energy demand management. A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Project delivery on time, with agreed quality and assigned budget, is the desire of project-based companies. Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contracts on Ethereum can be used to encode business logic and have been applied to many different areas, such as token exchanges and games. Unlike general programs, the computations of contracts on Ethereum are restricted by the gas limit. If a transaction runs out of the gas limit before an execution finishes, the Ethereum virtual machine throws an out-of-gas exception, and the entire transaction fails, which reverts to the state before the transaction started, although the transaction fee is still deducted. It is therefore, essential to conduct a gas estimation before sending a transaction. Existing studies have mostly failed in estimating the gas for a loop function because the number of iterations of the loops cannot be statically determined. However, we found that a quarter of all contracts have loop functions, and the gas cost for the loops is higher than for the other functions. Therefore, it is necessary to apply a gas estimation for the loop functions. In this study, we propose a gas estimation approach based on the transaction trace to dynamically estimate the gas for the loop functions. Our belief is that we can learn the relationship between the historical transaction traces and their gas costs to estimate the gas for new transactions. We considered three different abstractions of the original transaction trace and fed them to different machine learning models. The results show that our approach is effective in gas estimation and that a random forest can achieve the most accurate estimation.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Nevertheless, the transactional semantics of SC which follow ACID transactions are not appropriate for BP characteristics. Indeed, it is admitted that ACID transactions are limited to cope with complex control structure and long running execution of BP. Transactional Business Processes (TBP for short) have emerged as an extension to ACID models to overcome these limits. A TBP ensures transactional reliability of advanced transactions having a control structure as complex as for BP. In this paper, we propose an approach that builds on SC and extends them to implement TBP. We extend Caterpillar, an existing BP execution engine developed on top of Ethereum, to implement our approach and support the execution of TBP.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the electric power market, comparing the status quo with the recent trend towards the increase in distributed self-generation capabilities by prosumers. Starting from the existing tension between the intrinsically hierarchical current structure of the electricity distribution network and the substantially distributed and self-organising nature of the self-generation, we explore the limitations imposed by the current conditions. Initially, we introduce a potential multi-layered architecture for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy market, discussing the fundamental aspects of local production and local consumption as part of a microgrid. Secondly, we analyse the consequent changes for the different users' roles, also in connection with some incentive models connected with the decentralisation of the power production. To give a full picture to the reader, we also scrutinise relevant elements of energy trading, such as Smart Contract and grid stability. Thirdly, we present an example of a typical P2P settlement, showcasing the role of all the previously analysed aspects. To conclude, we performed a review of relevant activities in this domain, to showcase where existing projects are going and what are the most important themes covered. Being this a work in progress, many open questions are still on the table and will be addressed in the next stages of the research. Eventually, by providing a reference model as base for further discussions and improvements, we would like to engage ourselves in a dialog with the different users and the broad community, oriented towards a more fair and ecological-friendly solution for the electricity market of the future.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, blockchain proposals are being adopted to solve security issues, such as data integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation. To improve certain aspects, e.g., energy consumption and latency, of traditional blockchains, different architectures, algorithms, and data management methods have been recently proposed. For example, appendable-block blockchain uses a different data structure designed to reduce latency in block and transaction insertion. It is especially applicable in domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), where both latency and energy are key concerns. However, the lack of some features available to other blockchains, such as Smart Contracts, limits the application of this model. To solve this, in this work, we propose the use of Smart Contracts in appendable-block blockchain through a new model called context-based appendable-block blockchain. This model also allows the execution of multiple smart contracts in parallel, featuring high performance in parallel computing scenarios. Furthermore, we present an implementation for the context-based appendable-block blockchain using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Finally, we execute this implementation in four different testbed. The results demonstrated a performance improvement for parallel processing of smart contracts when using the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emerging blockchain technology has enabled various decentralised applications in a trustless environment without relying on a trusted intermediary. It is expected as a promising solution to tackle sophisticated challenges on personal data management, thanks to its advanced features such as immutability, decentralisation and transparency. Although certain approaches have been proposed to address technical difficulties in personal data management; most of them only provided preliminary methodological exploration. Alarmingly, when utilising Blockchain for developing a personal data management system, fictions have occurred in existing approaches and been promulgated in the literature. Such fictions are theoretically doable; however, by thoroughly breaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we clarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly inefficient due to the natural limitations of the blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution in which such fictions are reduced by designing a novel system architecture with a blockchain-based 'proof of permission' protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing service built on top of a public blockchain platform. We believe that our research resolves existing ambiguity and take a step further on providing a practically feasible solution for decentralised personal data management. © 2019 IEEE.},

However, smart contracts have to comply with national and international laws and accountability of participant's actions. Soundness of a smart contract has to be verified in terms of law compliance. Here, we propose a model for verification and validation of law compliance of smart contracts in IoT environments.

	abstract = {Blockchain has become a pervasive technology in a wide number of sectors like industry, research, and academy. With the emergence of blockchain, new solutions with this technology to existing problems were devised, leading to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts are similar to traditional contracts with the benefits provided by blockchain, such as immutability, privacy, and decentralisation. These contracts are usually defined based on a specific domain, and this domain knowledge can be represented through an ontology. Researches have explored the benefits of using domain ontologies with smart contracts, such as code generation, discovering other contracts in the network, or interaction with other contracts. Notwithstanding, the representation of smart contract languages themselves has not been studied. In this paper, we present an ontology for a well-known smart contract language, Solidity, defining all entities needed to cover the whole language and aligning it to other standardised ontologies such as EthOn, in a way to improve the knowledge of the ontology developed. Furthermore, the ontology has also been validated with already deployed contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, Solidity will be able to benefit from the advantages provided by ontologies, such as interoperability and the use of semantic web technologies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This study sought to apply these core technologies to future validated algorithms that make real estate transactions secure to come up with an encryption algorithm. In addition, the real estate transaction is being paid a large fee by the middlemen, the real estate agent. Furthermore and recently, P2P (peer-to-peer) real estate exchange is used a lot. However, these P2P real estate exchanges also have problems that have not been identified by each other between landlords and tenants. In particular, a research model was established to compare and verify the PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance) algorithm of Hyperledger through the blockchain agreement process. Subsequently, a process for verifying the real estate contract was established. Through VM (virtual machine) research methodology for the verification of blockchain real estate contracts, ElGamal communication was provided to prove quantum cryptography. We also automated lightweight encryption test verification tools and blockchain smart contract VM (virtual machine) models using artificial intelligence. Verification was performed through a reservation server and a monitoring server using a test verification tool for network-based lightweight security IoT (Internet of things) GW (gateway). It presents important ECP (elastic curve program) and elastic curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) models among the main functions of the blockchain smart contract, and it is equipped with quantum-based encryption algorithm. In addition, the necessary UML (unified modeling language) source code and performance data were calculated according to the actual experimental environment, and the average value for blockchain for administrative or government authorized assets—4000 TPS (transaction per second) were tested. In the future, we want to use this technology for real estate transactions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To try and relieve the burden on the National Grid and still progress electrification activities, the smart microgrid model and secure energy trade paradigm is considered—enabled by the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Given the high availability requirements of microgrid operations, the limited resources available on IIoT devices and the high processing and energy requirements of DLT operations, this work aims to determine the effect of native DLT algorithms when implemented on IIoT edge devices to assess the suitability of DLTs as a mechanism to establish a secure, energy trading market for the Internet of Energy. Metrics such as the node transaction time, operating temperature, power consumption, processor and memory usage are considered towards determining possible interference on the edge node operation. In addition, the cost and time required for mining operations associated with the DLT-enabled node are determined in an effort to predict the cost to end users—in terms of fees payable and mobile data costs—as well as predicting the microgrid’s growth and potential blockchain network slowdown. © 2021 by the authors.

Initiating secure and efficient energy trading mechanisms among networked microgrids for reliability and economic mutual benefits have become a crucial task. Recently, integrating blockchain technologies into the energy sector have gained significant amount of interest, e.g. transactive grid. This paper proposes a two-layer secured smart contract-based energy trading mechanism to allow microgrids to establish coalitions, adjust the electricity-trading price, and achieve transparent and decentralized secure transactions without intervention of a third trusted party. Since reliability benefits are main drivers of microgrids operation in islanded mode, a new decentralized smart contract based-energy trading model for islanded networked microgrids is proposed in the first layer with an objective to achieve demand generation balance. In the second layer, and to achieve a higher security, all executed contracts are verified and saved in a blockchain based on a new developed two-phase consensus method that utilizes practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), and a modified Proof of Stake (PoS). Simulations are conducted in Python environment to validate the proposed energy trading model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new clean-slate architecture for the future Internet. Efficient content retrieval is the original intention of NDN design. The content retrieval process driven by content consumers in NDN includes the following challenges, consumers do not know whether the content exists and whether the content producer is reliable. Invalid interest packets could cause the occupation of limited network resources and DoS attack problem. To ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data packets, consumers need to pre-configure the trust schema, which is centralized and prone to the single point of failure problem. Blockchain has widespread attention to build trust in a distributed way, and Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, a decentralized smart contract platform. To lighten the burden of consumers, we proposed a Smart Contract-based Trusted Content Retrieval Mechanism (SCTCRM) for NDN in this paper. The mechanism contains a trustworthy information base for content and producers based on smart contracts, and provides content retrieval and name resolution services for content consumers. The purpose of this mechanism is to improve the efficiency and security of content retrieval process. We described the framework and the workflow of SCTCRM, and used Colored Petri Nets to create a formal mathematical model and analyze the security of the mechanism. Finally, the cost of storage and Gas in smart contracts are evaluated through the prototype deployment. From the results, we can see that the proposed mechanism is security and practicality. © 2013 IEEE.},

Although the museum is a non-profit organization, if it can provide digital exhibits and collections under the premises of “intellectual property rights” and “cultural assets protection”, and licensing and adding value in various fields, it can generate revenue from digital licensing and handle the expenses of museum operations. This will be a new trend in the sustainable development of museum operations. Especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of this year (2020), the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) recently stated that nearly a third of the museums in the United States may be permanently closed since museum operations are facing “extreme financial difficulties.” This research is aimed at museums using the business model of “digital authorization”. It proposes an authorization mechanism based on block chain technology protecting the museums’ digital rights in the business model and the application of cryptography. The signature and time stamp mechanism achieve non-repudiation and timeless mechanism, which combines block chain and smart contracts to achieve verifiability, un-forgery, decentralization, and traceability, as well as the non-repudiation of the issue of cash flow with signatures and digital certificates, for the digital rights of museums in business. The business model proposes achievable sustainable development. Museums not only achieve the goal of promoting social education, but also solve their financial problems. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The introduction of a review system in e-commerce platforms results in an effective business model. The effects of positive/negative reviews on the success of a product are well studied in the literature. Therefore, for the vendors, it is crucial to obtain positive reviews of their products. This fact opens fraudulent scenarios. Indeed, some vendors can pay an incentive to the buyers to obtain, in exchange, a fake positive review. This fake-review system (FRS) is so widespread that vendors rely on ad-hoc companies that, through intermediaries, find buyers available to release fake reviews. In this paper, we propose a game-theory-based strategy to discourage the above fraudulent business model, and an effective way to implement this strategy leveraging an Ethereum smart contract. Specifically, the contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we formalize the current business model as a sequential game, and we identify sufficient conditions making FRS advantageous. Second, we propose to introduce in the review system a new mechanism, thanks to which, the corresponding sequential game requires conditions necessary to make advantageous FRS that are strictly less convenient than the previous ones. We implemented the solution and evaluate the cost of the smart contract execution. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Smart contracts — computer protocols that regulate the exchange of crypto-assets in trustless environments — have become popular with the spread of blockchain technologies. A landmark security property of smart contracts is liquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain frozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed by recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD millions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for smart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for currency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main result is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on the behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the context. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e. if the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We then verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We implement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts and compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of representative contracts. © M. Bartoletti, S.

	abstract = {Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are the cornerstone for the security of the communication layer of online services relying on certificate-based authentication, such as e-commerce, e-government, online banking, cloud services, and many others. A PKI is an infrastructure based on a hierarchical model, but the use of PKIs in non-hierarchical contexts has exposed them to many types of attacks. Here, we discuss weaknesses exploited in past attacks and we propose a solution based on an original consensus algorithm developed for use on blockchain technology. In this implementation we retain the full functionality around X.509 certificates, i.e., for the triad (server name, server address, X.509 server certificate), and demonstrate a mechanism for obtaining fast consensus. The main properties of the solution are that a consensus may be reached even when not all members of the involved PKI participate in a transaction, and that no advanced trust agreement among PKIs is needed. The proposed solution is able to detect PKI attacks and can distinguish errors from attacks, allowing precise management of anomalies. © 2020 by the author.},

For example, these data can be related to pollution and gas emissions, which can be used to check the compliance with national and international regulations. The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing. We characterize the communication efficiency of three basic DLT-based IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms of latency and energy consumption. The model and analyses of these protocols provide a benchmark for IoT data trading applications.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The conventional architecture of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with a centralized approach has difficulty overcoming the increasing complexity of intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications as well as challenges in providing large amounts of data storage, trust management, and information security. Therefore, vehicular edge computing networks (VECNets) have emerged to provide massive storage resources with powerful computing on network edges. However, a centralized server in VECNets is insufficient due to potential data leakage and security risks as it can still allow a single point of failure (SPoF). We propose consortium blockchain and smart contracts to ensure a trustworthy environment for secure data storage and sharing in the system to address these challenges. Practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is utilized because it is suitable for consortium blockchain to audit publicly, store data sharing, and records the whole consensus process. It can defend against system failures with or without symptoms to reach an agreement among consensus participants. Furthermore, we use an incentive mechanism to motivate the vehicle to contribute and honestly share their data. The simulation results satisfy the proposed model’s design goals by increasing vehicular networks’ performance in general. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this work, however, we present an RBAC model based on blockchain technology to enhance user authentication before knowledge is accessed and utilized in a knowledge management system (KMS). Our blockchain-based system model and the smart contract ensure that transparency and knowledge resource immutability are achieved. We also present smart contract algorithms and discussions about the model. As an essential part of RBAC model applied to KMS environment, trust is ensured in the network.

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has attracted much attention from people around the world. Scammers take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain to implement financial fraud. The Ponzi scheme, one of the main scam methods, has defrauded investors of large amounts of money, thereby harming their interests and hindering the application of blockchain. Unfortunately, the current detection technology typically largely relies on the source code of the contract or uses a single feature which does not fully represent the contract characteristics. In such a case, the detection of Ponzi schemes with high efficiency becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose an image-based scam detection method using an attention capsule network (SE-CapsNet) focused on Ethereum. The sequence of bytecode, the opcode frequency, and the application binary interface (ABI) call are extracted as features from the contract bytecode and ABI, further converted into grayscale images, and then mapped into three color channels to generate RGB images, which are used as the input of the model for detecting the Ponzi scheme contract. In addition, we employ fancy PCA for data augmentation to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the detection results. Experimental results show that the image-based detection method using deep learning models can effectively detect contracts before transactions occur. Among them, our proposed SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results, with an F1 score of 98.38%.  © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the transparent characteristic may disclose sensitive information of candidate for all system users have the same right to their information. Besides that, the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain will lead to the disclosure of voters’ privacy and the third-parties such as registration institutions involved in voting process also have possibility of tampering data. To overcome these difficulties, we apply authority management mechanism into blockchain-based voting systems. In this paper, we put forward AMVchain, a fully decentralized and efficient blockchain-based voting system. AMVchain has a three-layer access control architecture, and on each layer, smart contracts are responsible for validation and granting permissions. Linkable ring signature is adopted in the process of voting to protect ballot-privacy. AMVchain also makes a tradeoff between efficiency and concurrency by introducing proxy nodes.

	abstract = {A Smart Community (SC) is an essential part of the Internet of Energy (IoE), which helps to integrate Electric Vehicles (EVs) and distributed renewable energy sources in a smart grid. As a result of the potential privacy and security challenges in the distributed energy system, it is becoming a great problem to optimally schedule EVs' charging with different energy consumption patterns and perform reliable energy trading in the SC. In this paper, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving energy trading system for 5G-deployed SC is proposed. The proposed system is divided into two components: EVs and residential prosumers. In this system, a reputation-based distributed matching algorithm for EVs and a Reward-based Starvation Free Energy Allocation Policy (RSFEAP) for residential homes are presented. A short-term load forecasting model for EVs' charging using multiple linear regression is proposed to plan and manage the intermittent charging behavior of EVs. In the proposed system, identity-based encryption and homomorphic encryption techniques are integrated to protect the privacy of transactions and users, respectively. The performance of the proposed system for EVs' component is evaluated using convergence duration, forecasting accuracy, and executional and transactional costs as performance metrics. For the residential prosumers' component, the performance is evaluated using reward index, type of transactions, energy contributed, average convergence time, and the number of iterations as performance metrics. The simulation results for EVs' charging forecasting gives an accuracy of 99.25%. For the EVs matching algorithm, the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm converges faster than the bichromatic mutual nearest neighbor algorithm. For RSFEAP, the number of iterations for 50 prosumers is 8, which is smaller than the benchmark. Its convergence duration is also 10 times less than the benchmark scheme. Moreover, security and privacy analyses are presented. Finally, we carry out security vulnerability analysis of smart contracts to ensure that the proposed smart contracts are secure and bug-free against the common vulnerabilities' attacks. The results show that the smart contracts are secure against both internal and external attacks.  © 2022 Adamu Sani Yahaya et al.},

	abstract = {Governments rely on collected data to analyze their citizens' health requirements and needs. Such data is usually of scattered manner gathered by several agencies and entities that fall under different business models and goals. Hence, the scattered nature of this data creates a burden on governments in precisely planning adequate health bills that guarantee the wellbeing of their citizens. Furthermore, the issue of synchronizing and having a real-time access to such data exacerbates the problem even more. Therefore, a system that guarantees the integrity, accessibility, correctness and security of medical data in a highly synchronized environment is crucial for governments to accurately project their future needs. In this paper, we present Smart-Health (SHealth), a blockchain-based health management system. In its crux, SHealth is a private multi-layered blockchain integrated with a multi-tiered addressing scheme that defines the privileges and permissions of entities in the system. Blockchain-based systems assure security, reliability, availability, resistance against tampering and malicious attacks, seamless integration, and easy data management.

	abstract = {Transactions related to vehicles include manufacturing, buying, selling, paying insurance(takaful), obtaining regular inspection, leasing a vehicle from banks, getting in an accident, engaging in a traffic violation, calculating price predictions and renting a vehicle. Many people perform transactions related to vehicles in their daily life; transportation authorities also perform vehicle transactions as part of managing vehicle fleets. But tracking these transactions is a challenging task. There are countrywide solutions that uses centralized systems. However, these solutions have problems with trust management, transparency, and access control. Therefore, we believe there is still room for integrated automation of various vehicle-related transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based framework for vehicle tracking that incorporates the mentioned features. Moreover, blockchain is customized to enable usage control for additional transactions, such as inspection, renting and islamic insurance. The usage control model is integrated with IoT devices to continuously monitor the vehicles for certain conditions and remotely revoke access if needed. The complete transaction set is recorded over an immutable ledger that provides trust, transparency and a complete history of record. In this paper, we also presents a prototype implementation of a permissioned blockchain, which will be made available under the GNUv3 General Public License. Performance analysis is performed on the newly proposed framework implementation over the permissioned blockchain to measure its adoption and suitability. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are executable programs that enable the building of a programmable trust mechanism between multiple entities without the need of a trusted third-party. At the time of this writing, there were over 10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage. Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are essential if smart contracts are to gain mainstream acceptance. Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions of the contract-under-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart contracts. In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Advanced wireless technology in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing and facing various security threats. The authentication of IoT devices is the first line of defense for the wireless network. Especially in a Wi-Fi network, the existing authentication methods mainly use a password or digital certificate, these methods are inconvenient to manage due to certificate issuance or prone to be attacked because passwords are easily cracked. In this paper, we propose a location-aware authentication scheme using smart contracts to ensure that IoT devices can securely perform Wi-Fi network authentication. The scheme adopts the concept of secondary authentication and consists of two phases: the registration phase, which is mainly designed to complete the generation of the public and private keys, and to link the device information with its related device information; the authentication phase, which is mainly designed to determine whether the requesting device is within a legal location range. We use the smart contract to ensure the credibility and irreparability of the authentication process. Analysis of the attack model and the attacks at different stages proves that this certification scheme is assured, and the simulation results show that the overhead introduced by this scheme is acceptable, this scheme can provide greater security for the Wi-Fi authentication of IoT devices. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being deployed in huge numbers around the world, and often present serious vulnerabilities. Accordingly, delivering regular software updates is critical to secure IoT devices. Manufactures face two predominant challenges in providing software updates to IoT devices: 1) scalability of the current client-server model and 2) integrity of the distributed updates-exacerbated due to the devices' computing power and lightweight cryptographic primitives. Motivated by these limitations, we propose CrowdPatching, a blockchain-based decentralized protocol, allowing manufacturers to delegate the delivery of software updates to self-interested distributors in exchange for cryptocurrency. Manufacturers announce updates by deploying a smart contract (SC), which in turn will issue cryptocurrency payments to any distributor who provides an unforgeable proof-of-delivery. The latter is provided by IoT devices authorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required conditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor to generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system called zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers three main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely by enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial distribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor network). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account for. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in IoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the more constraint IoT devices. Thirdly, the trustworthiness of distributors is considered in our protocol, rewarding the honest distributors' engagements. We provide both informal and formal security analysis of CrowdPatching using Tamarin Prover.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the innovation of embedded devices, the concept of smart marketplace came into existence. A smart marketplace is a platform on which participants can trade multiple resources, such as water, energy, bandwidth. Trust is an important factor in the trading platform, as the participants would prefer to trade with those peers who have a high trust rating. Most of the existing trust management models for smart marketplace only provide a single aggregated trust score for a participant. However, they lack the mechanism to gauge the level of commitment shown by a participant while trading a particular resource. This work aims to provide a fine-grained trust score for a participant with respect to each resource that it trades. Several parameters, such as resource availability, success rate, and turnaround time are used to gauge the participant’s level of commitment, specific to the resource being traded. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through security analysis against ballot-stuffing and bad-mouthing attacks, along with simulation-based analysis and a comparison in terms of accuracy, false positive, false negative, computational cost and latency. The results indicate that the proposed trust model has 7% better accuracy, 30.13% lower computational cost and 31.74% less latency compared to the existing benchmark model. © 2021 by the authors.

The cloud server provides the IT resources required by customers in a self-service manner through the network, realizing business expansion and rapid innovation. However, due to the insufficient protection of data privacy, the problem of data privacy leakage in cloud storage is threatening cloud computing. To address the problem, we propose BC-PECK, a data protection scheme based on blockchain and public key searchable encryption. Firstly, all the data is protected by the encryption algorithm. The privacy data is encrypted and stored in a cloud server, while the ciphertext index is established by a public key searchable encryption scheme and stored on the blockchain. Secondly, based on the characteristics of trusted execution of smart contract technology, a control mechanism for data accessing and sharing is given. Data transaction is automatically recorded on the blockchain, which is fairer under the premise of ensuring the privacy and security of the data sharing process. Finally, we analyzed the security and fairness of the current scheme. Through the comparison with similar schemes, we have shown the advantages of the proposed scheme. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {With the development of communication 5G networks and technologies, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce. The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

From the traceability data, contractual decisions may be taken such as incident detection, validation of the delivery or billing. The stakeholders require transparency in the whole process. The combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the blockchain paradigms helps in the development of automated and trusted systems. In this context, ensuring the quality of the IoT data is an absolute requirement for the adoption of those technologies. In this article, we propose an approach to assess the data quality (DQ) of IoT data sources using a logistic traceability smart contract developed on top of a blockchain. We select the quality dimensions relevant to our context, namely accuracy, completeness, consistency and currentness, with a proposition of their corresponding measurement methods. We also propose a data quality model specific to the logistic chain domain and a distributed traceability architecture. The evaluation of the proposal shows the capacity of the proposed method to assess the IoT data quality and ensure the user agreement on the data qualification rules.

	abstract = {As a key technology for the development of 5G networks, network slicing is developing rapidly. Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice. IEEE},

	abstract = {Large commercial buildings are complex cyber-physical systems containing expensive and critical equipment that ensure the safety and comfort of their numerous occupants. Yet occupant and visitor access to spaces and equipment within these buildings are still managed through unsystematic, inefficient, and human-intensive processes. As a standard practice, long-term building occupants are given access privileges to rooms and equipment based on their organisational roles, while visitors have to be escorted by their hosts. This approach is conservative and inflexible. In this paper, we describe a methodology that can flexibly and securely manage building access privileges for long-term occupants and short-term visitors alike, taking into account the risk associated with accessing each space within the building. Our methodology relies on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, audit, and revoke fine-grained permissions for building occupants and visitors, in a decentralised fashion. The smart contracts are specified through a process that leverages the information compiled from Brick and BOT models of the building. We illustrate the proposed method through a typical application scenario in the context of a real office building and argue that it can greatly reduce the administration overhead, while, at the same time, providing fine-grained, auditable access control.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has recently inspired remarkable attention due to its unique features, such as privacy, accountability, immutability, and anonymity, to name of the few. In contrast, core functionalities of most Internet of Things (IoT) resources make them vulnerable to security threats. The IoT devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have limited capacity in terms of network, computing, and storage, which make them easier for vulnerable threats. Furthermore, a massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices, which is still an open challenge for the existing platforms to process, analyze, and unearth underlying patterns to provide convenience environment. Therefore, a new solution is required to ensure data accountability, improve data privacy and accessibility, and extract hidden patterns and useful knowledge to provide adequate services. In this paper, we present a secure fitness framework that is based on an IoT-enabled blockchain network integrated with machine learning approaches. The proposed framework consists of two modules: a blockchainbased IoT network to provide security and integrity to sensing data as well as an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine to discover hidden insights and useful knowledge from IoT and user device network data. The enhanced smart contract aims to support users with a practical application that provides real-time monitoring, control, easy access, and immutable logs of multiple devices that are deployed in several domains. The inference engine module aims to unearth underlying patterns and useful knowledge from IoT environment data, which helps in effective decision making to provide convenient services. For experimental analysis, we implement an intelligent fitness service that is based on an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine as a case study where several IoT fitness devices are used to securely acquire user personalized fitness data. Furthermore, a real-time inference engine investigates user personalized data to discover useful knowledge and hidden insights. Based on inference engine knowledge, a recommendation model is developed to recommend a daily and monthly diet, as well as a workout plan for better and improved body shape. The recommendation model aims to facilitate a trainer formulating effective future decisions of trainee’s health in terms of a diet and workout plan. Lastly, for performance analysis, we have used Hyperledger Caliper to access the system performance in terms of latency, throughput, resource utilization, and varying orderer and peers nodes. The analysis results imply that the design architecture is applicable for resource-constrained IoT blockchain platform and it is extensible for different IoT scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Health information exchange (HIE) refers to the integrated management and secure sharing of health information among healthcare entities. HIE improves healthcare quality and streamlines healthcare administrative work. These advantages have propelled health-care stakeholders to implement HIE. However, challenged by issues such as security, privacy, and costs, HIE is not widespread. Recent studies have suggested blockchain-based HIE for solving security and privacy issues. Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE. Finally, we compare MEXchange with Ancile, FHIRChain, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (IHE XDS), and MedRec. The MEXchange lowers barriers to the application of blockchain-based HIE systems by mitigating privacy and security issues among healthcare stakeholders.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts can be regarded as one of the most popular blockchain-based applications. The decentralized nature of the blockchain introduces vulnerabilities absent in other programs. Furthermore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to patch a smart contract after it has been deployed. Therefore, smart contracts must be formally verified before they are deployed on the blockchain to avoid attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. There is a recent surge of interest in analyzing and verifying smart contracts. While most of the existing works either focus on EVM bytecode or translate Solidity contracts into programs in intermediate languages for analysis and verification, we believe that a direct executable formal semantics of the high-level programming language of smart contracts is necessary to guarantee the validity of the verification. In this work, we propose a generalized formal semantic framework based on a general semantic model of smart contracts. Furthermore, this framework can directly handle smart contracts written in different high-level programming languages through semantic extensions and facilitates the formal verification of security properties with the generated semantics. © The Author(s) 2020.},

However, in Ethereum, miners do not receive a reward for verifying. This implies that miners face the Verifier's Dilemma: use resources for verification, or use them for the more lucrative mining of new blocks? We provide an extensive analysis of the Verifier's Dilemma, using a data-driven model-based approach that combines closed-form expressions, machine learning techniques and discrete-event simulation. We collect data from over 300,000 smart contracts and experimentally obtain their CPU execution times. Gaussian Mixture Models and Random Forest Regression transform the data into distributions and inputs suitable for the simulator. We show that, indeed, it is often economically rational not to verify, in particular for miners with less hashing power. We consider two approaches to mitigate the implications of the Verifier's Dilemma, namely parallelization and active insertion of invalid blocks, both will be shown to be effective. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Health Information Exchange (HIE) exhibits remarkable benefits for patient care such as improving healthcare quality and expediting coordinated care. The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology is seeking patient-centric HIE designs that shift data ownership from providers to patients. There are multiple barriers to patient-centric HIE in the current system, such as security and privacy concerns, data inconsistency, timely access to the right records across multiple healthcare facilities. After investigating the current workflow of HIE, this paper provides a feasible solution to these challenges by utilizing the unique features of blockchain, a distributed ledger technology which is considered 'unhackable'. Utilizing the smart contract feature, which is a programmable self-executing protocol running on a blockchain, we developed a blockchain model to protect data security and patients' privacy, ensure data provenance, and provide patients full control of their health records. By personalizing data segmentation and an 'allowed list' for clinicians to access their data, this design achieves patient-centric HIE. We conducted a large-scale simulation of this patient-centric HIE process and quantitatively evaluated the model's feasibility, stability, security, and robustness. © 2013 IEEE.},

Researchers have embarked on efforts with logic rules, symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in smart contract vulnerability detection tasks.

In this paper, we attempt to utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional long-short term memory with attention mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we propose contract snippet representations for smart contracts, which contributes to capturing essential semantic information and control flow dependencies. Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart contracts show that our proposed model and contract snippet representations significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {The complexity of today’s integrated circuit (IC) supply chain, organised in several tiers and including many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging to assess the history and integrity of procured ICs. This enables malicious practices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely dangerous, especially in supply chains of ICs for industrial control systems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can be put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by introducing Anti-BlUFf (Anti-counterfeiting Blockchain- and PUF-based infrastructure), an approach where ICs are uniquely identified and tracked along the chain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies; hence, it is decentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity of stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of ICs along the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary interested in tampering with ICs along the supply chain and then provide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed anti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking system against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show its technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit mitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our solution ad its integration with real IC supply chains. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The versatility of the Solidity language allows developers to program general-purpose smart contracts. Among the various smart contracts, there may be some fraudulent ones, whose purpose is to steal Ether from the network participants. A notorious example of such cases are Ponzi schemes, i.e. a financial frauds that require investors to be repaid through the investments of others who have just entered the scheme. Within the Ethereum blockchain, several contracts have been identified as being Ponzi schemes. The paper proposes a machine learning model that uses textual classification techniques to recognize contracts emulating the behavior of a Ponzi scheme. Starting from a contracts dataset containing exclusively Ponzi schemes uploaded between 2016 and 2018, we built models able to properly classify Ponzi schemes contracts. We tested several models, some of which returned an overall accuracy of 99% on classification. The best model turned out to be the linear Support Vector Machine and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which provides the best results in terms of metrics evaluation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers.

	abstract = {The deployment of small-scale renewable energy sources will transform the management of energy grids towards more decentralized solutions in which the prosumers will have a more active role. Regulatory and market barriers are driving the implementation of virtual aggregation models in which the small-scale prosumers work together on a larger scale to gain benefits that could not be obtained on an individual basis. In this paper, we propose to use public blockchain and self-enforcing smart contracts to construct Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) of prosumers to provide energy services. A model has been defined for capturing the prosumer level constraints in terms of available energy profiles and energy service requirements enabling their optimal aggregation in hierarchical structures. A lightweight decentralized solution for VPPs construction is implemented using smart contracts enabling its efficient running on the public blockchain. Smart contracts are encoding the model constraints and are defining functionalities for prosumers to initiate or join a VPP implementing the complete chain of Offer-Operate-Measure-Remunerate actions. The VPP will be managed on top of a distributed ledger technology offering decentralized functionality for tracking and validating the delivery of energy based on the blockchain transactions and for energy and financial settlement, the remuneration being done according to the amount of energy provided by individual prosumers. Experimental results show that the proposed solution runs successfully on the public blockchain with good execution time and can address Balancing Responsible Party requests for additional generation. The overhead in terms of gas consumption and transactional throughput stays within reasonable boundaries.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in information management systems coupled with machine learning algorithms paved the way for a significant revolution in animal healthcare industries. However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RIVIMS. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A smart public transport system is expected to be an integral part of our human lives to improve our mobility and reduce the effect of our carbon footprint. The safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public transport system from cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide more comprehensive protection against potential cyberattacks, we propose a novel approach that combines blockchain technology and a deep learning method that can better protect the smart public transport system. By the creation of signed and verified blockchain blocks and chaining of hashed blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can withstand unauthorized integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport maintenance data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep learning-based method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical exchange of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The experimental results of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three different datasets (i.e., CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show that our deep learning model is effective to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks achieving more than 95% F1-score across all three datasets in average. The comparison of our approach with other similar methods confirms that our approach covers a more comprehensive range of security properties for the smart public transport system. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Production lines in pharmaceutical manufacturing generate numerous heterogeneous data sets from various embedded systems which control the multiple processes of medicine production. Such data sets should arguably ensure end-to-end traceability and data integrity in order to release a medicine batch, which is uniquely identified and tracked by its batch number/code. Consequently, auditable computerised systems are crucial on pharmaceutical production lines, since the industry is becoming increasingly regulated for product quality and patient health purposes. This paper describes the EU-funded SPuMoNI project, which aims to ensure the quality of large amounts of data produced by computerised production systems in representative pharmaceutical environments. Our initial results include significant progress in: (i) end-to-end verification taking advantage of blockchain properties and smart contracts to ensure data authenticity, transparency, and immutability; (ii) data quality assessment models to identify data behavioural patterns that can violate industry practices and/or international regulations; and (iii) intelligent agents to collect and manipulate data as well as perform smart decisions. By analysing multiple sensors in medicine production lines, manufacturing work centres, and quality control laboratories, our approach has been initially evaluated using representative industry-grade pharmaceutical manufacturing data sets generated at an IT environment with regulated processes inspected by regulatory and government agencies. © 2021 The Author(s)},

However, while many contributions in the literature assess SC computational expressiveness, an evaluation of their power in terms of coordination (i.e., governing interaction) is still missing. This is why in this paper we test mainstream SC implementations by evaluating their expressive power in coordinating both inter-users and inter-SC activities. To do so, we exploit the archetypal LINDA coordination model as a benchmark-a common practice in the field of coordination models and languages-by discussing to what extent mainstream blockchain technologies support its implementation. As they reveal some notable limitations (affecting, in particular, coordination between SC) we then show how Tenderfone, a custom blockchain implementation providing for a more expressive notion of SC, addresses the aforementioned limitations. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The widespread recognition of the smart contracts has established their importance in the landscape of next generation blockchain technology. However, writing a correct smart contract is notoriously difficult. Moreover, once a state-changing transaction is confirmed by the network, the result is immutable. For this reason, it is crucial to perform a thorough testing of a smart contract application before its deployment. This paper's focus is on the test coverage criteria for smart contracts, which are objective rules that measure test quality. We analyze the unique characteristics of the Ethereum smart contract program model as compared to the conventional program model. To capture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the notions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction interaction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent inter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum transactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the permutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two notions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms are given to the generation of coverage requirements. A case study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed test coverage criteria with random testing and statement coverage testing. © 2019 IEEE.},

COVID-19 pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs so far. It is now obvious that the world is in dire need for non-clinical, real-time, faster and cost-effective and secure smart solutions for monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients and hence mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, Machine learning approaches can be leveraged in all aspects that could impact the patients and the future care guidelines. However, ensuring the data privacy, security and the conformity to data protection regulations will become even more of a challenge. This leads to the requirement for secured and privacy-preserving machine learning mechanisms for COVID-19-based healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned IoMT data for a clinical decision support (CDS) system. The proposed system does not require any intervention or direct interactions between data owners. Both local training and building the global classification model run on verifiable and private smart contracts rather than relying on untrusted third parties.

In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories. For the sake of verification, tests have been conducted for the electricity consumption and supply management system designed for prosumers of renewable energy. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) relies on on-device training to avoid the migration of devices' data to a centralized server to address privacy leakage. Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL's smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that ST-BFL has the same accuracy as traditional FL. However, ST-BFL provides input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance at the expense of relatively higher computation and communication costs than traditional FL.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Software engineers must deal with them to ensure the quality of smart contracts in all phases of the smart contract lifecycle, from requirements specifications to design and deployment. This broad scope and criticality of smart contracts in business environments means that they have to be expressed in a language that is intuitive, easy-to-use, independent of the blockchain platform employed, and oriented towards software quality assurance.

It is a hot topic in the field of machine learning, and HAR is gaining more attention among researchers due to its unique societal and economic advantages. This paper focuses on a collaborative computation scenario where a group of participants will securely and collaboratively train an accurate HAR model. The training process requires collecting a massive number of personal activity features and labels, which raises privacy problems. We decentralize the training process locally to each client in order to ensure the privacy of training data. Furthermore, we use an advanced secure aggregation algorithm to ensure that malicious participants cannot extract private information from the updated parameters even during the aggregation phase. Edge computing nodes have been introduced into our system to address the problem of data generation devices' insufficient computing power. We replace the traditional central server with smart contract to make the system more robust and secure. We achieve the verifiability of the packaged nodes using the publicly auditability feature of blockchain. According to the experimental data, the accuracy of the HAR model trained by our proposed framework reaches 93.24%, which meets the applicability requirements. The use of secure multiparty computation techniques unavoidably increases training time, and experimental results show that a round of iterations takes 36.4 seconds to execute, which is still acceptable.  © 2022 Lin Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are decentralized applications running on Blockchain. A very large number of smart contracts has been deployed on Ethereum. Meanwhile, security flaws of contracts have led to huge pecuniary losses and destroyed the ecological stability of contract layer on Blockchain. It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to effectively and efficiently detect vulnerabilities in contracts. Existing detection methods like Oyente and Securify are mainly based on symbolic execution or analysis. These methods are very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution requires the exploration of all executable paths or the analysis of dependency graphs in a contract. In this work, we propose ContractWard to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts with machine learning techniques. First, we extract bigram features from simplified operation codes of smart contracts. Second, we employ five machine learning algorithms and two sampling algorithms to build the models. ContractWard is evaluated with 49502 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ContractWard. The predictive Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 of ContractWard are over 96% and the average detection time is 4 seconds on each smart contract when we use XGBoost for training the models and SMOTETomek for balancing the training sets. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The term lsmart contractsz has become ubiquitous to describe an enormous number of programs uploaded to the popular Ethereum blockchain system. Despite rapid growth of the smart contract ecosystem, errors and exploitations have been constantly reported from online contract systems, which has put financial stability at risk with losses totaling millions of US dollars. Most existing research focuses on pinpointing specific types of vulnerabilities using known patterns. However, due to the lack of awareness of the inherent nondeterminism in the Ethereum blockchain system and how it affects the funds transfer of smart contracts, there can be unknown vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers to access numerous online smart contracts. In this paper, we introduce a methodical approach to understanding the inherent nondeterminism in the Ethereum blockchain system and its (unwanted) influence on contract payments. We show that our new focus on nondeterminism-related smart contract payment bugs captures the root causes of many common vulnerabilities without relying on any known patterns and also encompasses recently disclosed issues that are not handled by existing research. To do so, we introduce techniques to systematically model components in the contract execution context and to expose various nondeterministic factors that are not yet fully understood. We further study how these nondeterministic factors impact contract funds transfer using information flow tracking. The technical challenge of detecting nondeterministic payments lies in discovering the contract global variables subtly affected by read-write hazards because of unpredictable transaction scheduling and external callee behavior. We show how to augment and instrument a contract program into a representation that simulates the execution of a large subset of the contract behavior. The instrumented code is then analyzed to flag nondeterministic global variables using off-the-shelf model checkers. We implement the proposed techniques as a practical tool named NPChecker (Nondeterministic Payment Checker) and evaluate it on 30K online contracts (3,075 distinct) collected from the Ethereum mainnet. NPChecker has successfully detected nondeterministic payments in 1,111 online contracts with reasonable cost. Further investigation reports high precision of NPChecker (only four false positives in a manual study of 50 contracts). We also show that NPChecker unveils contracts vulnerable to recently-disclosed attack vectors. NPChecker can identify all six new vulnerabilities or variants of common smart contract vulnerabilities that are missed by existing research relying on a lcontract vulnerability checklist.. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

	abstract = {Still to this day, academic credentials are primarily paper-based, and the process to verify the authenticity of such documents is costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error and fraud. Digitally signed documents facilitate a cost-effective verification process. However, vulnerability to fraud remains due to reliance on centralized authorities that lack full transparency. In this paper, we present the mechanisms we designed to create secure and machine-verifiable academic credentials. Our protocol models a diploma as an evolving set of immutable credentials. The credentials are built as a tree-based data structure with linked time-stamping, where portions of credentials are distributed over a set of smart contracts. Our design prevents fraud of diplomas and eases the detection of degree mills, while increasing the transparency and trust in the issuer’s procedures. Our evaluation shows that our solution offers a certification system with strong cryptographic security and imposes a high level of transparency of the certification process. We achieve these benefits with acceptable costs compared to existing solutions that lack such transparency. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Access control is one of the most important security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection over IoT devices. This paper proposes a new scheme that combines attribute-based access control (ABAC) model with blockchain technology and uses smart contracts for access control judgment. This scheme can realize dynamic, distributed and reliable access control in the open IoT environment. The IoT access control system based on this scheme consists of five functional modules. The information registration point registers information for each device that joins the system. Policy enforcement point (PEP) is responsible for managing agent-devices in the system and processing original access requests from access subjects. Policy decision point (PDP) makes access control right decision through smart contracts. Policy administration point (PAP) is used to manage smart contract information. Policy information point (PIP) is used to manage key attribute information of devices used for access control judgment. The scheme also includes three types of smart contracts, one management contract (MC) is used to manage other contracts in the system, one policy decision contract (PDC) is responsible for obtaining attribute information from PIP and making final access control right decision, and a large number of policy contracts (PCs) which composed of a public policy contract (PPC) and a large number of exclusive policy contracts (EPCs). These PCs are used to implement specific attribute-based access control policies. To demonstrate the application of the scheme, we simulated a scenario of access control in a home IoT environment and verified the feasibility of access control decisions using our proposed scheme through three experiments. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Power system reforms worldwide have commoditized electric energy, and thus the electricity market has been developed. With this, trading of electric energy takes place in various time-domains like the day ahead, real-time, etc. These transactions take place over the counter (OTC) or Power Exchange (Px), which provide the market participants with the required platform and payment security. The transactions on OTC and Px requires a third-party platform and guarantee for contract and settlement, there incurs overhead cost. Since electric energy is a fungible commodity, it can be transacted very well with the old system like barter. Energy Banking is one such mechanism wherein one utility supplies the energy to another utility that needs it more and, in leisure, the energy can then be provided back. The requisite security of the transactions can be provided by blockchain technology. Energy banking is presently being done only on a MW quantum basis with no price tag, despite the cost being dependent on the demand-supply ratio. To ensure energy banking transactions in real-time and free from the perils of financial settlements, this article suggests the use of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model of blockchain technology for executing Smart Contracts mutually agreed upon by both parties and avoiding third party overhead costs. © Authors retain all copyrights.},

	abstract = {Personal IoT data is a new economic asset that individuals can trade to generate revenue on the emerging data marketplaces. Typically, marketplaces are centralized systems that raise concerns of privacy, single point of failure, little transparency and involve trusted intermediaries to be fair. Furthermore, the battery-operated IoT devices limit the amount of IoT data to be traded in real-time that affects buyer/seller satisfaction and hence, impacting the sustainability and usability of such a marketplace. This work proposes to utilize blockchain technology to realize a trusted and transparent decentralized marketplace for contract compliance for trading IoT data streams generated by battery-operated IoT devices in real-time. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we propose an autonomous blockchain-based marketplace equipped with essential functionalities such as agreement framework, pricing model and rating mechanism to create an effective marketplace framework without involving a mediator, (2) we propose a mechanism for selection and allocation of buyers' demands on seller's devices under quality and battery constraints. We present a proof-of-concept implementation in Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. We investigated the impact of buyer's demand on the battery drainage of the IoT devices under different scenarios through extensive simulations. Our results show that this approach is viable and benefits the seller and buyer for creating a sustainable marketplace model for trading IoT data in real-time from battery-powered IoT devices. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows virtual disintermediation and automatization of property transactions, which might help to design future platforms, intended to facilitate cross-border transactions within the EU and worldwide. To this end, users of these blockchain-based platforms may create the so-called “digital tokens” or “colored coins” that aim to represent rights over different types of “real world” assets. By transferring a digital token, the parties aim to transfer the ownership or other property rights over the asset represented by the token without the intervention of traditional intermediaries, such as real estate conveyancers, land registrars or notaries specializing in real estate. However, this new technological tool raises several questions in the field of private law, such as the legal nature of the token, how the effective transfer of the property rights operates or how ownership rules may be applied in this decentralized environment (e.g. rights and duties of the token holder). Some of the issues at stake have only been tentatively addressed by both lawmakers and academia. In light of this research gap, this paper addresses these controversial issues from both a private law and a comparative perspective, and proposes a model to tokenize the right of usufruct over chattels and real estate, analyzing its legal viability and limitations across six jurisdictions. The paper concludes that private law rules may be adapted to the tokenization of property rights, which may contribute to the establishment of a digital market for the trading of asset-backed tokens worldwide. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Modern blockchains support a variety of distributed applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts, which let users execute arbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency, contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work, we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract, one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This has led to the development of analyzers for specific platforms and languages. However, blockchain platforms present significant variability in languages and cost models, as well as over time. Approaches that facilitate the quick development and adaptation of cost analyses are thus potentially attractive in this context. We explore the application of a generic approach and tool for cost analysis to the problem of static inference of gas consumption bounds in smart contracts. The approach is based on Parametric Resource Analysis, a method that simplifies the implementation of analyzers for inferring safe bounds on different resources and with different resource consumption models. In addition, to support different input languages, the approach also makes use of translation into a Horn clause-based intermediate representation. To assess practicality we develop an analyzer for the Tezos platform and its Michelson language. We argue that this approach offers a rapid, flexible, and effective method for the development of cost analyses for smart contracts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Blockchain provides an immutable distributed ledger for storing transactions. One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Efficient and reliable access control in smart cities is critical for the protection of various resources for decision making and task execution. Existing centralized access control schemes suffer from the limitations of single point of failure, low reliability, and poor scalability. This article, therefore, proposes a distributed and reliable access control framework for smart cities by combining the blockchain smart contract technology and the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. The framework consists of one policy management contract (PMC) for managing the ABAC policies, one subject attribute management contract (SAMC) for managing the attributes of subjects (i.e., entities accessing resources), one object attribute management contract (OAMC) for managing the attributes of objects (i.e., resources being accessed), and one access control contract (ACC) for performing the access control. To show the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a local private Ethereum blockchain system to implement the four smart contracts and also conduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the proposed framework with an existing access control list (ACL)-based scheme. The experimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money than the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary cost during the system running especially for large-scale smart cities.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The dramatic rise in internet-based service provisioning has highlighted the importance of deploying scalable access control methods, facilitating service authorization for eligible users. Existing centralized methods suffer from single-point-of-failure, low scalability, and high computational overhead. In addition, in these methods, users pay for the service provider as well as the network provider independently for a specific service, imposing extra cost for the user. New business models are needed to resolve such shortcomings. The realization of these models calls for sophisticated access control methods which consider the requirements of all parties who want to: 1) access a service; 2) provide that service; and 3) provide the network connection. Blockchain is an enabling technology that provides unprecedented opportunities to novel distributed access control methods for new business models. We propose an Attribute-based access control solution by leveraging Blockchain to share network providers' and service providers' resources. Our solution offers access flexibility based on the requirements of the parties while fulfilling reliability, accountability, and immutability. Besides, it decreases the overall service cost which is beneficial for each party. Our solution makes it possible for service providers to outsource their access control procedures without requiring a trusted third party. The experiments confirm that our solution can provide a fast, comprehensive, and scalable access control mechanism.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Ethereum blockchain enables executing and recording smart contracts. The smart contracts can facilitate, verify, and implement the negotiation between multiple parties, also guaranteeing transactions without a traditional legal entity. Many tools supporting the smart contracts development in different areas are flourishing because in Ethereum blockchain valuable assets are often involved. Some of the tools help the developer to find security vulnerabilities via static and/or dynamic analysis or to reduce the Gas fees consumption. Despite the plethora of such tools, there is no tool supporting smart contracts evaluation and analysis via a graphical representation for expert developers.The paper embraces this way to facilitate the developers' analysis activity, by proposing a graphical representation model to visualize smart contract source code. The paper makes available a tool via a web interface, which accepts the smart contract address as an input and produces a graphical representation of the smart contract as an output. The graphical representation can help developers to better understand the structure of smart contracts and share it with other developers. Moreover, some metrics, such as the relations among smart contracts, are easier to be understood via "spatial"than "tabular"representation. Indeed, representing smart contracts' metrics via visual representation facilitates the developers, who are used to analyse the source code by directly inspecting it or using other tools that provide the metrics in a table format. Finally, the paper provides detailed data regarding a smart contract to the developers and proposes a graphical representation of the smart contracts without obscuration of details, also highlighting areas of the code that are possibly too big in size and/or too complex via a diagram displaying their connections. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that are executed across a blockchain. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be modified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting target for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing millions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on symbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation. Recently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts. However, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving low code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to achieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination of symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on smart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart contracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex conditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts. Moreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius by comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for smart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and a dataset of 21K real-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs than state-of-the-art tools (up to 23%) and that it outperforms existing tools in terms of code coverage (up to 69%). We also demonstrate that data dependency analysis can boost bug detection up to 18%.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic situation has proved to be disastrous for humanity throughout the world. However, during this period, people must take precautions for safety purposes. One of the essential steps towards eliminating or reducing the effect of COVID-19 is maintaining social distancing while in public places. Some people are neglecting the social distancing norms while on the move. Still, no surveillance system exists, which monitors the people's movement for social distancing and securely efficiently shares the information with the concerned administration department. There also exists no penalty system which forces the people to ensure social distancing. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-envisioned scheme for monitoring social distancing to combat COVID-19 situations. The proposed scheme uses fast region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and you only look once (YOLO) models for the object (i.e., human) detection through the live video feed captured from the static CCTV cameras as well as lens-equipped drones. Further, the efficient euclidean distance calculation is embedded for calculating the distance between two humans. Blockchain technology ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information between the entities at the physical layer and the administration departments. Blockchain wallets are also used to pay the fine when people do not follow social distance norms. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on three broad parameters such as (i) human detection and violation identification, (ii) blockchain simulation and analysis, and (iii) network performance comparison. The parameters considered for (i) is confidence score, for (ii) are scalability, hash rate, and simulation interface, and for (iii) are network bandwidth, throughput, packet loss rate, and network latency. By analyzing all the parameters mentioned above, we observe the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional approaches.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology that brings transparency in a scalable way for multiple organizations and this is thanks to its several features. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them, decentralization is undoubtedly the most interesting one. Organizations can share data within a distributed ledger. As a consequence, each one can access synchronized data stored in its local Blockchain node. This functionality improves transaction tracking and facilitates access to data within a private group of organizations. However, in some cases, even if organizations accept to share data, they require to hide some private information related to their users or their business model. To tackle privacy and trust issues between organizations, this paper presents a blockchain architecture based on the proxy re-encryption scheme. This scheme is integrated within smart contracts to provide a very efficient, fast, and secure platform. The proposed architecture is implemented in an Hyperledger Blockchain and tested in a real transport and mobility use case.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, cost- ing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnera- ble contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce ÆGIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the blockchain. We compare ÆGIS to current state-of-the-art tools and demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks. Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported and yet unreported attacks in the wild.  © 2020 ACM.},

Based on the content and architecture of traditional contract, a smart contract model with wider application scope is designed. Findings: In this paper, several models are used to describe the operation mechanism of smart contracts. To facilitate computer execution, a decomposition method is proposed, which divides smart contracts into several sub-contracts. Then, the advantages and deployment methods of smart contract are discussed. On this basis, a specific example is given to illustrate how the application of smart contract will change our life. Originality/value: Smart contract is gradually applied to more fields. In this paper, the structure and operation mechanism of smart contract system in reality are given, which will be beneficial to the application of smart contract to more complex systems. © 2019, Tianyu Feng, Xiao Yu, Yueting Chai and Yi Liu.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.},

The national economy’s orientation toward the use of modern achievements of the digital industry will contribute to a faster transition to the global information society. Digitalization of education will make it possible to use the latest scientific achievements for the development of other areas of life in society. This study presents a model that applies distributed registry technologies based on blockchains and smart contracts for the reliable storage and efficient use of date relating to the population’s professional competencies. This model aims to create a unified information environment for interaction between all the actors of the economic system. The authors developed the model for registering professional competencies of the population and their developmental paths based on modern digital technologies. We substantiate the efficiency and security assured by blockchain technology for information storage and transmission. Educational institutions of all levels, governmental authorities controlling education, and people taking part in the educational process are the basic actors of the system presented. The proposed model presents the educational level and professional skills of each registered person as an education index (EI), which keeps track of all educational achievements and professional competencies of the participant over their lifetime. When calculating the EI, the authors also propose to consider ratings of the educational institutions responsible for the participant’s professional skills. The implementation of the EI will significantly simplify the process of employing graduates from various educational institutions, as well as the college admissions process. In addition, analytic tools could be used to create ratings of colleges, school departments, and even specific teachers. The registry of professional competencies we developed is directed at the processing and storage of large volumes of data (Big Data). In the future, this will allow us to open access to the registry to employers, pension insurance funds, and other state authorities that require complete and reliable personal data. © 2020 Business Informatics.

	abstract = {Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are one of the main building blocks for securing communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the control of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by numerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault tolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart contract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of PKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity systems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even constant) sized amount of data for verifying identity records stored off chain. However, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little information regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs. In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart contract based PKI of Patsonakis et al. on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs constant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore this tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates the need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of Patsonakis et al. and, as illustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized state that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we compare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g., the Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart contract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost model. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would be useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so that it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent publications, we presented a novel formal symbolic process virtual machine (FSPVM) framework that combined higher-order logic theorem proving and symbolic execution for verifying the reliability and security of smart contracts developed in the Ethereum blockchain system without suffering from standard issues surrounding reusability, consistency, and automation. A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. This paper addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) is challengeable due to lacking a trustworthy platform. This paper presents a witness model to credibly enforce the cloud service level agreement. Through introducing the witness role and using the blockchain based smart contract, we solve the trust issues about who can detect the service violation, how the violation is confirmed and the compensation is guaranteed. In this model, a verifiable consensus sortition algorithm proposed by us is firstly leveraged to select independent witnesses to form a witness committee. They are responsible for a specific service level agreement and get paid by monitoring and detecting service violation. Through carefully designing the witness' payoff function in the agreement, we further leverage game theory to analyze and prove that it is not the witness itself is trustworthy. Instead, the witness has to tell the truth because of its greedy nature, which is the desire to maximize its own revenue. As long as the service violation is confirmed by the witness committee, the compensation is automatically transferred to the customer by the smart contract. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype with the smart contract of Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the feasibility of our model. © 2018 IEEE.},

A wireless sensor network is the core technology to support the operation of the IoT, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Aiming at the problem that the existing malicious node detection methods in wireless sensor networks cannot be guaranteed by fairness and traceability of detection process, we present a blockchain trust model (BTM) for malicious node detection in wireless sensor networks. First, it gives the whole framework of the trust model. Then, it constructs the blockchain data structure which is used to detect malicious nodes. Finally, it realizes the detection of malicious nodes in 3D space by using the blockchain smart contract and the WSNs' quadrilateral measurement localization method, and the voting consensus results are recorded in the blockchain distributed. The simulation results show that the model can effectively detect malicious nodes in WSNs, and it can also ensure the traceability of the detection process. © 2019 IEEE.},

However, its use may very well also lead to increased complexity resulting from having to subsume work that displaced intermediary institutions had performed. We present our perspective that smart contracts may be used to mitigate this increased complexity. We further posit that smart contracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can be verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an inter- organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong in an intra- organizational context. We state that smart contracts that implement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially beneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce inter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may ensure effective evaluation and comparison between different intra-organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our perspective by describing Intellichain, which implements formal, agent-based simulation model as a smart contract to provide epidemiological decision support. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To date, cash on delivery (COD) is one of the most popular payment methods in developing countries thanks to the blossom of customer-to-customer e-commerce. With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people's daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue. In particular, we propose a multi-session mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and transparent across delivering sessions in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism ensure the efficiency of delivering process. The authors release our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. We conclude that the integration of multi-session mechanism and blockchain technology will cause significant efficiency across several disciplines. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

	abstract = {Swarms of robots will revolutionize many industrial applications, from targeted material delivery to precision farming. However, several of the heterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future applications—robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent behavior, etc.—hinder the evolution of the technology from academic institutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology originated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer networks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement on a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for a controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even profitable. This position paper explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative solutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New security, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for swarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples. Finally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the combination of these two technologies are described. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Implementing a circular economy business model which is profitable for businesses operating physical assets, while at the same time does not conflict with strategic goals of environmental policies can be a complex and risky undertaking for a single entity, especially if the asset operator is a small-to-medium enterprise (SMEs). To mitigate this, a collaborative circular economy business model is proposed, where the circular economy cycle is materialized by assets transitioning between asset operators on a demanddriven approach. Demand itself is partially based on the asset's state, which is described by its circular properties (location, condition, availability). The asset state and its transition between operators can be monitored by auditors and governmental regulators to ensure asset integrity and compliance with environmental targets. This common view of asset state between all parties can be enabled by blockchains and smart contracts, which can provide the underlying technology to share data with integrity, while simultaneously offering more efficient interoperability between participants. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual asset record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for regulated environmental jurisdictions. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Blockchain has been expected to create a secure mechanism for exchanging not only for cryptocurrency but also for other types of assets without the need for a powerful and trusted third-party. This could enable a new era of the Internet usage called the Internet of Value (IoV) in which any types of assets such as intellectual and digital properties, equity and wealth can be digitized and transferred in an automated, secure, and convenient manner. In the IoV, Blockchain is used to guarantee security of transactions that the transactions are nearly impossible to be altered; thus it is impractical to retract once a transaction is confirmed. Therefore, to strengthen the IoV, before making any transactions it is crucial to evaluate trust between participants for reducing the risk of dealing with malicious peers. In this article, we clarify the concept of IoV and propose a trust-based IoV model including a system architecture, components and features. Then, we present a trust platform in the IoV considering two concepts, Experience and Reputation, originated from Social Networks for evaluating trust between two any peers in the IoV. The Experience and Reputation are characterized and calculated using mathematical models with analysis and simulation in the IoV environment. We believe this paper consolidates the understandings about IoV technologies and demonstrates how trust is evaluated and used to strengthen the IoV. It also opens important research directions on both IoV and trust in the future. © 2018 IEEE.},

This model does not require manual intervention at any point in the process; no data recorded on the distributed ledgers can be tampered with or revoked. The data collected using this model can be used as information on events, providing data support for the events approach to basic accounting theory. This practice responds to the important insight of sorter, who proposes the provision of accounting information in real time and on demand to substantially improve the usefulness of accounting information.

	abstract = {In Malaysia, a new regulation of traffic offences demerit points has been over a debate. Therefore, a blockchain model is formulated to solve this issue. It serves a purpose to be a Proof of Work (PoW) of a blockchain system. This model contains application layer and blockchain layer with smart contract inside. The smart contracts act as a conditional filter which follows the regulation rules. It contains three contracts starting from the declaration of each offence's demerit points and fines until the penalties when a certain amount of demerit points is collected, including revocation of driver license. The contracts will be automatically executed when such conditions are fulfilled. A transaction schema is also designed to match the schema of a traffic offence system. This model is deployed in online environment with two servers synced to each other to prove the decentralized characteristic of blockchain. It is developed using NodeJS while preserving JSON format for transaction between server and client. A user interface is also provided as a simulation media where a traffic officer can input offences and send it to blockchain server while public users or the driver itself can check the status of the driver license recorded on the blockchain. Government officer can monitor the records through a dashboard analytics provided which contains graphs and charts based on the records. This interface is used as media to do evaluation which produces satisfying results. The evaluation shows that the smart contracts are executed properly as compared to real regulations. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it’s hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Trading cryptocurrency on current digital exchange platforms is a trust-based process, where the parties involved in the exchange have to fully trust the service provider. As it has been proven several times, this could lead to funds being stolen, either due to malicious service providers that simply disappear or due to hacks that these platforms might suffer. In this work, we propose and develop a decentralised exchange solution based on smart contracts running on the Ethereum network that is open, verifiable, and does not require trust. The platform enables two parties to trade different currencies, limited to Ethereum and Bitcoin in the current status of the system. A smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, functions as an escrow, which holds a user’s funds until a verified transaction has been made by the other party. To make the smart contract able to detect a Bitcoin transfer, we implement our solution by utilising an oracle. We define the system architecture and implement a working platform, which we test in a model scenario, successfully exchanging Bitcoin and Ether on the blockchain test networks. We conclude the paper identifying possible challenges and threats to such a system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue for the role of the blockchain, i.e., distributed ledger technology, in building innovative business models, including machine money, autonomous economic agents and decentralised organisations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things. Findings: The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology’s adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies. Originality/value: The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three models for our approach with di.erent granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions. Our implementations show in practice the feasibility and limitations of contracts for the purposes identified in this paper. © 2017 ACM.},

	abstract = {Nowadays robots are able to perform decisions independent from the operator. Also, they are able to form a various kind of unions, such as swarms, schools, or coalitions to perform joint task solving. The most powerful and flexible type of union is coalitions. Due to each robot acts like an independent agent it is important to provide trusted interaction between them. It is quite hard to do this with existing methods based only on the knowledge representation using ontologies and reasoning techniques. The paper proposes to use smart contracts in blockchain to enrich the knowledge-based system by functions, specific for blockchain such as immutable transaction log, consensus between all participants as well as possibility to automate control on task resolving.

Firstly, based on the blockchain and smart contract technology, a decentralized power trading model is proposed to realize the information equivalence and transparent openness of power trading. Then, considering the randomness and uncertainty of EV charging and discharging, the EV trading parties use the reverse auction mechanism based on dynamic pricing strategy to complete the transaction matching, which can not only improve the profit of the less competitive power seller, but also it can reduce the cost of the electricity purchaser. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of our proposed scheme, V2G's EV power trading smart contract was designed, and the smart contract was released to Ethereum and simulated experiments were carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with traditional power trading schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record. In this paper, we have developed a blockchain access control ecosystem that gives asset owners the sovereign right to effectively manage access control of large data sets and protect against data breaches.

The relevance of this issue is witnessed by a recent liquidity attack to the Ethereum Parity Wallet, which has frozen ~160M USD within the contract, making this sum unredeemable by any user. We address the problem of verifying liquidity of Bitcoin contracts. Focussing on BitML, a contracts DSL with a computationally sound compiler to Bitcoin, we study various notions of liquidity. Our main result is that liquidity of BitML contracts is decidable, in all the proposed variants. To prove this, we first transform the infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on the behaviour of any given set of contracts, abstracting the context moves. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound and complete. Our decision procedure for liquidity is then based on model-checking the finite space of states of the abstraction. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Businesses need trust to confidently perform trade among each other. Centralized business models are the only mature solutions available to perform trades over the Internet. However, they have many problems which includes but are not limited to the fact that these create bottleneck on the server as well as requires trusted third parties. Recently, decentralized solutions have gained significant popularity and acceptance for future businesses. The wide acceptance of such systems is indeed due to the trust management among various untrusted business stakeholders. Many solutions have been proposed in this regard to provide de-centralized infrastructure for various business models. A standard solution that is acceptable to the industry is still in demand. Hyperledger umbrella Blockchain projects, that are supported by IBM and many other industry big players are gaining popularity due to its efficient and pluggable design. In this study, the author present the idea of utilizing Blockchain to design a Value-Added Tax (VAT) system for Saudi Arabia's newly introduced tax system. The reason to select this business model for VAT is twofold. First, it provides an untampered distributed ledger, which cannot be deceived by any party. Each transaction in the system cannot go unnoticed by the smart contract. Secondly, it provides a transparent record, and updates all involved parties regarding each activity performed by stakeholders. The newly proposed system will provide a transparent database of VAT transactions according to our smart contract design and at each stage of supply chain, tax will be deducted and stored on peer-to-peer network via consensus process. The author believes that the proposed solution will have significant impact on VAT collection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net. Value net modeling offers a precise abstract representation which provides in the detailed informational requirements in a canonical form and it connects i.e. implements the abstract notion of Service Oriented Architecture characterizing systems without loss of crucial informational elements. � 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs, deployed on a peer-to-peer network and executed in a consensus-based fashion. Their bytecode is public, immutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As smart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are attractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully been exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses. The correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first approaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in formal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze individual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e., calls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the actual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic execution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported by annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In contrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional, inter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode with a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While the analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we analyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from unreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to handle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain its implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and demonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Smart contract platforms, the most notable of which is probably Ethereum, facilitate the development of important and diverse distributed applications (e.g., naming services and fungible tokens) in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the inherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and verify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an underpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no incentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is faced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically increasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and directly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce an alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is of constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are stored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage network. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as any key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely deployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show that Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it minimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's future. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold manner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state of smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network. Second, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations reflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show that under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed by smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction fees by up to an order of magnitude. © 2019 IEEE.},

Central to this model is the service-dominant 'building-block'-type provision of care services to patients, paired with the collaboration of healthcare providers through a common infrastructure. This combination enables the forming of a decentralized, holistic care cycle. Sharing of patient medical informationis pivotal towards reaching this goal; however, preserving medical record integrity and privacy, while at the same time allowing provider interoperability are often conflicting requirements. Blockchains and Smart Contracts can provide the underlying technology to support the decentralized care cycle by addressing patient privacy and medical record integrity, while simultaneously offering efficient interoperability between providers. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for a system operating within a regulated healthcare jurisdiction. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Physical layer security (PLS) is considered as a promising technique to prevent information eavesdropping in wireless systems. In this context, cooperative relaying has emerged as a robust solution for achieving PLS due to multipath diversity and relatively lower transmission power. However, relays or the relay operators in the practical environment are unwilling for service provisioning unless they are incentivized for their cost of services. Thus, it is required to jointly consider network economics and relay cooperation to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint network economics and PLS using cooperative relaying and jamming. Based on the double auction theory, we model the interaction between transmitters seeking for a particular level of secure transmission of information and relay operators for suitable relay and jammer assignment, in a multiple source-destination networks. In addition, theoretical analyses are presented to justify that the proposed auction mechanism satisfies the desirable economic properties of individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. As the participants in the traditional centralized auction framework may take selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a decentralized and trustless auction framework based on blockchain technology. In particular, we exploit the smart contract feature of blockchain to construct a completely autonomous framework, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. The security properties of the proposed framework are also discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decentralised (on-blockchain) and centralised (off-blockchain) platforms are available for the implementation of smart contracts. However, none of the two alternatives can individually provide the services and quality of services (QoS) imposed on smart contracts involved in a large class of applications. The reason is that blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Likewise, off-blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks emerging from their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several applications, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on and off-blockchain platforms are more adequate. Developers that informatively choose between the three alternatives are likely to implement smart contracts that deliver the expected QoS. Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap and as a proof of concept, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. We show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off-blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the rinkeby ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool. © 2018 IEEE.},

To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts.

Although COD allows consumers to be more proactive in making payments, it still appears to be vulnerable by the appearance of a third party (shipping companies). In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on "smart contract" implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract.

	abstract = {The Internet of Energy (IoE) provides an effective networking technology for distributed green energy, which allows the connection of energy anywhere at any time. As an important part of the IoE, electric vehicles (EVs), and charging pile management are of great significance to the development of the IoE industry. Previous work has mainly focused on network performance optimization for its management, and few studies have considered the security of the management between EVs and charging piles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized security model based on the lightning network and smart contract in the blockchain ecosystem; this proposed model is called the lightning network and smart contract (LNSC). The overall model involves registration, scheduling, authentication, and charging phases. The new proposed security model can be easily integrated with current scheduling mechanisms to enhance the security of trading between EVs and charging piles. Experimental results according to a realistic infrastructure are presented in this paper. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance vehicle security. Different performances of LNSC-based scheduling strategies are also presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT)-based E-commerce is a new business model that relies on autonomous transaction management on IoT-devices. The management system toward IoT-based E-commerce demands autonomy, lightweight, and legitimacy. As blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, we adopt it to design the autonomous transaction management system on IoT E-commerce. However, current blockchain solutions, most namely cryptocurrencies, have fatal drawbacks of nonsupervisability and huge computational overhead, and hence cannot be directly applied on IoT-based E-commerce. In this paper, we propose NormaChain, a blockchain-based normalized autonomous transaction settlement system for IoT-based E-commerce. By designing a special three-layer sharding blockchain network, we can significantly increase transaction efficiency and system scalability. Additionally, by designing an innovative decentralized public key searchable encryption scheme (decentralized public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme), we can uncover illegal and criminal transactions and achieve crime traceability. Our new decentralized PEKS scheme cryptographically eliminates the dependence of a trusted central authority in the original PEKS scheme and instead expands it to a fully decentralized governance, which distributes the supervision power equally among all parties. More importantly, by proving NormaChain is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks and against the stealing of the secret key, we show that NormaChain prevents a legitimate user's privacy from being violated by banks, supervisors or malicious adversaries. Finally, we deliver the NormaChain system with design details and full implementations. Experiments show that the average transaction-per-second on IoT devices is around 113, and the supervision accuracy is 100% when proper target illegal keywords are provided. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Timed transaction execution is critical for various decentralized privacy-preserving applications powered by blockchain-based smart contract platforms. Such privacy-preserving smart contract applications need to be able to securely maintain users' sensitive inputs off the blockchain until a prescribed execution time and then automatically make the inputs available to enable on-chain execution of the target function at the execution time, even if the user goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust. This paper presents a new decentralized privacy-preserving transaction scheduling approach that allows users of Ethereum-based decentralized applications to schedule transactions without revealing sensitive inputs before an execution time window selected by the users. The proposed approach involves no centralized party and allows users to go offline at their discretion after scheduling a transaction. The sensitive inputs are privately maintained by a set of trustees randomly selected from the network enabling the inputs to be revealed only at the execution time. The proposed protocol employs secret key sharing and layered encryption techniques and economic deterrence models to securely protect the sensitive information against possible attacks including some trustees destroying the sensitive information or secretly releasing the sensitive information prior to the execution time. We demonstrate the attack-resilience of the proposed approach through rigorous analysis. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrates that the proposed approach is effective and has a low gas cost and time overhead associated with it. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the storage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on mobile cloud environments, where mobile devices are integrated with cloud computing to facilitate medical data exchanges among patients and healthcare providers. This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in lightweight access control design, minimum network latency with high security and data privacy levels, compared to the existing data sharing models. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In traditional cloud storage systems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as an important technology for solving the problem of data privacy and fine-grained access control. However, in all ABE schemes, the private key generator has the ability to decrypt all data stored in the cloud server, which may bring serious problems such as key abuse and privacy data leakage. Meanwhile, the traditional cloud storage model runs in a centralized storage manner, so single point of failure may leads to the collapse of system. With the development of blockchain technology, decentralized storage mode has entered the public view. The decentralized storage approach can solve the problem of single point of failure in traditional cloud storage systems and enjoy a number of advantages over centralized storage, such as low price and high throughput. In this paper, we study the data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems and propose a framework that combines the decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, the Ethereum blockchain, and ABE technology. In this framework, the data owner has the ability to distribute secret key for data users and encrypt shared data by specifying access policy, and the scheme achieves fine-grained access control over data. At the same time, based on smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the keyword search function on the cipher text of the decentralized storage systems is implemented, which solves the problem that the cloud server may not return all of the results searched or return wrong results in the traditional cloud storage systems. Finally, we simulated the scheme in the Linux system and the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show that our scheme is feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts allow untrusting parties to arrange agreements encoded as code deployed on a blockchain platform. To release their potential, it is necessary to connect the contracts with the outside world, such that they can understand and use information from other infrastructures. However, there are many challenges associated with realizing such a system, and despite the existence of many proposals, no solution is secure, provides easily-parsable data, introduces small overheads, and is easy to deploy. In this paper, we propose Practical Data Feed Service (PDFS), a system that combines the advantages of the previous schemes and introduces new functionalities. PDFS extends content providers by including new features for data transparency and consistency validations. This combination provides multiple benefits like content which is easy to parse and efficient authenticity verification without breaking natural trust chains. PDFS keeps content providers auditable and mitigates their malicious activities (like data modification or censorship) and allows them to create a new business model. We show how PDFS is integrated with content providers, report on a PDFS implementation and present results from conducted experimental evaluations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain technology has been widely applied in the financial field. Therefore, the security of the blockchain smart contracts is among the most popular contemporary research topics. To improve the theorem-proving technology in this field, we are developing an extensible hybrid verification proof engine, denoted as FEther, for Ethereum smart contract verification. Based on Lolisa, which is a large subset of solidity mechanized in Coq, FEther guarantees the consistency between smart contracts and its formal model. Combining symbolic execution with higher order logic theorem-proving, FEther contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. Besides, in FEther, the verified code segments also can be reused to assist in the verification of other properties. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. The execution efficiency of FEther has far exceeded that of the interpreters that are developed in Coq in accordance with the standard tutorial. To the best of our knowledge, FEther is the first definitional interpreter of the solidity language in Coq. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed data storage has received more attention due to its advantages in reliability, availability and scalability, and it brings both opportunities and challenges for distributed data storage transaction. The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in and single point failure risk. To overcome the above shortcomings, considering the storage policy with erasure coding, in this paper we propose a decentralized transaction method for cloud storage based on a smart contract, which takes into account the resource cost for distributed data storage. First, to guarantee the availability and decrease the storing cost, a reverse Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based auction mechanism is proposed for storage resource selection and transaction. Then we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem of how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment. Based on the private chain of Ethereum, we make the simulation for the proposed storage transaction method. The results of simulation show that the proposed transaction model can realize competitive trading of storage resources and ensure the safe and economic operation of resource trading. © 2018 by the authors.},

Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

One reason of this new trend is the introduction of on-chain smart contracts enabling the implementation of decentralized applications in trust-less environments. Along with its adoption, attacks exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities are inevitably growing. To counter these attacks and avoid breaches, several approaches have been explored such as documenting vulnerabilities or model checking using formal verification. However, these approaches fail to capture the Blockchain and users behavior properties. In this paper, we propose a novel formal modeling approach to verify a smart contract behavior in its execution environment. We apply this formalism on a concrete smart contract example and analyze its breaches with a statical model checking approach. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It has been ten years since Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and introduced the concept of a blockchain. The original goal was to propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. Now, Blockchain proves to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services. Applications are being explored in healthcare (patient records), government (land registries) and electronics (Internet of Things). The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation. The characteristics of Industry 4.0 meets the blockchain-based system and the model can aid these changes. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Temporary workers play therefore, an important role in many companies, but this kind of activity is subject to a special form of legal protections and many aspects and risks must be taken into account for both employers and employees. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all actors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with the fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a protection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system wants to assist the employer in processing contracts with a fully automated and fast procedure. To resolve these problems, we propose the D-ES (Decentralized Employment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state system. Then we describe the enabling technology that makes us able to realize the D-ES. In fact, we propose the implementation of a DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) based system, consisting in a blockchain system and of a web-based environment. Thanks to the decentralized application platforms that makes us able to develop smart contracts. We define a discrete event control system that works inside the blockchain.

Therefore, when problems arise - violations of Service Level Agreements, data corruption, data leakage, security breaches - both customers and Cloud providers face the challenge of agreeing on which party is to be held responsible.

	abstract = {While Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely recognized as an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new challenges in terms of privacy and security. Access control (AC) is among the top security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection over IoT devices. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanism to meet the requirements of IoT systems. Another weakness in today’s AC is the centralized authorization server, which can cause a performance bottleneck or be the single point of failure. Inspired by the smart contract on top of a blockchain protocol, this paper proposes BlendCAC, which is a decentralized, federated capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information in large-scale IoT systems. A federated capability-based delegation model (FCDM) is introduced to support hierarchical and multi-hop delegation. The mechanism for delegate authorization and revocation is explored. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry PI nodes) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops) and tested on a local private blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution for IoT systems. © 2018 by the authors.

In order to realize this vision, we need a formal language to unambiguously describe contract clauses. We introduce Findel – a purely declarative financial domain-specific language (DSL) well suited for implementation in blockchain networks. We implement an Ethereum smart contract that acts as a marketplace for Findel contracts and measure the cost of its operation.

	abstract = {The second generation of blockchain represented by smart contracts has been developing vigorously in recent years. However, frequent smart contract vulnerability incidents pose a serious risk to blockchain ecosystem security. Since current symbol execution tools often fall into path explosion and thus lead to inefficient detection, this paper expands Mythril's framework to optimize its performance. Firstly, it finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally, it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000 smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time consumption by around 35% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not actually cause financial losses. But the proposed method only concentrates on code regions related to transfer of funds, so it can reduce the false alarm rate to some extent. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems which utilize the human intelligence to solve complex tasks have gained considerable interest and adoption in recent years. However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users' privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is a tamper-proof distributed transaction registry; first popularized by Bitcoin [1], it has now been extended to support storage of arbitrary state and computations in-ledger. Ethereum [2] and its smart contract model have proven to be a very popular choice for this task, routinely managing assets valued in the billions. However, development of such contracts has been anything but easy. While formally specified, the Ethereum execution platform is based on a low-level machine, quite similar to assembly; semantics for contract operations such as call are quite complex, and the need for resource management creates unanticipated modes of failure. The dominant day-to-day programming platform for Ethereum is Solidity [3], an Object- Oriented language that identifies contracts with objects. While reasoning about Solidity programs is much easier than for their bytecode counterparts, it is not extent of challenges either, and moreover, Solidity lacks a source-level semantics, which forces developers to reason over output bytecode again. In this short paper we explore the main barriers to lift in order to achieve a principled compilation strategy for Solidity. We will review the standard concepts on verified and secure compilation, and frame them in the context of the Ethereum platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of openness and decentralization is one which people have desired since years. Everyone wants transactional data to be transparent. When sensitive data are on the hand of third-parties, it may be susceptible to frauds and misuse. The advent of blockchain, a decentralized technology in cryptocurrency, has revealed an appropriate solution to address such issues. Blockchain maintains the integrity of a transaction. It not only secures from tempering and fraud but also ensures transactions are verifiable without involvement of an intermediate. Therefore, blockchain is applied to different decentralized domains that require trusted computing. Supply chain is one of these domains, that can benefit from trustworthy decentralized transactions initiated by multiple stakeholders. This paper presents a general model for a blockchain enabled supply chain. We have implemented this model using three smart contracts on an Ethereum platform. We have provided evidence of our verification and validation efforts. Our results convey the feasibility of the approach, which can streamline the administrative processes, and automatize the transactions making the system more efficient and transparent. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In blockchain systems, miners execute transactions in blocks. Since each block has a limit on the number of transactions, miners usually prioritise transactions by selecting the most profitable ones. However, miners are uncertain about the exact income and the exact cost of executing transactions. Thus, they are not able to make informed decisions of which transactions to select and execute in order to maximise their profits. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty that miners perceive about the income and the cost of executing transactions and the impact of this uncertainty on the profit miners can gain. To achieve this aim, we design a simulation model, collect the input data for the model, implement the model and run an experiment on the model. Our simulation results show that the uncertainty miners perceive about the cost of executing transactions has a significant impact on the block profit. On the contrary, our results do not show a significant impact of the income uncertainty on the block profit. © 2018 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of 'pre-verification' is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service. © 2016 ACM.},

The ramifications of these general conditions for scalability are analysed for Ethereum and then generalised to other current and future platforms.

Combining the characteristics of blockchain such as distribution, transparent, and collegiality with the actual needs of regional autonomy, we propose the hierarchical multi-domain blockchain (HMDBC) network structure and the secondary-check mechanism, which can support timely correction and replacement of the malicious supervision nodes by regional nodes co-governance, auxiliary verification of supervision nodes, and arbitration of superior regions. In order to optimize the supervision nodes election, we proposed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of credibility, which can be used to objectively and fairly evaluate the comprehensive reputation of each node in that region by considering various influencing factors of node performance indicators. Furthermore, we designed the data block structure model, which can support the supervisor node replacement. Our system can perform automatic food quality detection and warning of substandard food in the entire industrial chain, with the use of smart contracts combined with the food industry standards. Finally, comparing the complexity of the traditional blockchain system with PBFT consortium, our system is more secure, with lower broadcast complexity. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are computer programs that are executed by a network of mutually distrusting agents, without the need of an external trusted authority. Smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value (in the form of crypto-currency like Bitcoin). Hence, it is crucial that their implementation is bug-free. We identify the utility (or expected payoff) of interacting with such smart contracts as the basic and canonical quantitative property for such contracts. We present a framework for such quantitative analysis of smart contracts. Such a formal framework poses new and novel research challenges in programming languages, as it requires modeling of game-theoretic aspects to analyze incentives for deviation from honest behavior and modeling utilities which are not specified as standard temporal properties such as safety and termination. While game-theoretic incentives have been analyzed in the security community, their analysis has been restricted to the very special case of stateless games. However, to analyze smart contracts, stateful analysis is required as it must account for the different program states of the protocol. Our main contributions are as follows: we present (i) a simplified programming language for smart contracts; (ii) an automatic translation of the programs to state-based games; (iii) an abstraction-refinement approach to solve such games; and (iv) experimental results on real-world-inspired smart contracts. © The Author(s) 2018.},
