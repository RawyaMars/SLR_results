	abstract = {The Ethereum blockchain permits the development and deployment of smart contracts which can store and execute code “on-chain” — that is, entirely on nodes in the blockchain’s network. Smart contracts have traditionally been used for financial purposes, but since smart contracts are Turing-complete, their algorithmic scope is broader than any single domain. To that end, we design, develop, and deploy a comprehensive 3D rendering engine programmed entirely in Ethereum smart contracts, called Shackled. Shackled computes a 2D image from a 3D scene, executing every single computation on-chain, on Ethereum. To our knowledge, Shackled is the first and only fully on-chain 3D rendering engine for Ethereum. In this work, we 1) provide three unique datasets for the purpose of using and benchmarking Shackled, 2) execute said benchmarks and provide results, 3) demonstrate a potential use case of Shackled in the domain of tokenised generative art, 4) provide a no-code user interface to Shackled, 5) enumerate the challenges associated with programming complex algorithms in Solidity smart contracts, and 6) outline potential directions for improving the Shackled platform. It is our hope that this work increases the Ethereum blockchain’s native graphics processing capabilities, and that it enables increased use of smart contracts for more complex algorithms, thus increasing the overall richness of the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Hospitals provide diverse tasks essential for the delivery of patient care and are comprised of many functional units. This makes healthcare projects in construction highly complex among other types of building projects due to the specific regulations, multiple functions it must provide, complicated mechanical and electrical systems, and so on. This complexity embodies potential risk events during its construction, which not only influences the completion of the project but can impact the patients’ safety and health conditions even after the project is finished. To prevent such outcomes, risk management is a crucial process that can identify, evaluate, and properly mitigate risks along the project lifecycle. A key aspect of risk management is that it requires the interaction and contribution from multiple stakeholders of the project. Various frameworks and tools that enable collaborative management of risks among multiple stakeholders have been developed in the past. However, the developed frameworks are not suitable in the sense that it does not protect the confidentiality of individual inputs from the stakeholders. Moreover, these frameworks are centralized systems, which can bring issues related to the security and transparency of the information that is being stored. Blockchain technology is an emergent distributed ledger technology (DLT) that can provide solutions to the listed problems found in centralized systems. It is a novel system that records information on a decentralized, distributed ledger, where transactions are constantly duplicated and updated. This study explores the applicability of blockchain technology for healthcare risk management. The key functional elements of blockchain that can resolve the challenges faced by prior risk management frameworks have been identified and discussed. Based on the discussions, a conceptual information management model for managing healthcare project risks on a blockchain has been conceived. The development of the initial prototype has been explained. The research study illustrates the process, benefits, and limitations of adopting the blockchain technology for collaborative risk management in healthcare projects. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Digital freelancing refers to hiring potential employees to work on specific projects on a contract basis by organizations, companies, and individuals. Existing freelancing systems are based on client-server models and managed in a centralized way. Centralized freelancing systems are originating several issues: Lack of trust, payment delays, central control over all operations, less reliability, online frauds, and lack of fairness. Hence, we propose a decentralized freelancing system based on blockchain and biometrics. Blockchain in the freelancing system makes contracts decentralized, and no one can control the interaction and deals between buyers and sellers. Biometric signatures on smart contracts in the freelancing system enhance the authenticity and validity of agreements between buyers and sellers. Our decentralized freelancing system is an online web-based platform based on blockchain and biometrics and built on Python. It makes the interaction and deals between buyers and sellers via the innovative approach of smart contracts. The proposed work illustrates the development, implementation, and functionalities of the freelancing system, such as registration as buyer or seller, logging in to the system, posting a job, bidding on jobs, hiring process, finalizing deals with smart contracts having a biometric signature of both parties and distributing smart contracts among all stakeholders via blockchain. Our system proves the fairness, clarity, security, and reliability in all processes of posting and hiring without the involvement of any central management authority. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The article develops a logical understanding of processes for signature of legal contracts, motivated by applications to legal recognition of smart contracts on blockchain platforms. A number of axioms and rules of inference are developed that can be used to justify a 'meeting of the minds' precondition for contract formation from the fact that certain content has been signed. In addition to an 'offer and acceptance' process, the article considers 'signature in counterparts', a legal process that permits a contract between two or more parties to be brought into force by having the parties independently (possibly, remotely) sign different copies of the contract, rather than placing their signatures on a common copy at a physical meeting. It is argued that a satisfactory account of signature in counterparts benefits from a logic with syntactic self-reference. The axioms used are supported by a formal semantics, and a number of further properties of the logic are investigated. In particular, it is shown that the logic implies that when a contract has been signed, the parties do not just agree, but are in mutual agreement (a common-knowledge-like notion) about the terms of the contract.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications called ÐApps onto the blockchain for public use through the use of smart contracts. To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be issued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a contract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners in the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that block to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and code execution. It is crucial for ÐApp developers to be able to precisely estimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define and provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the transactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different factors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time estimation services are used by ÐApp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet, these services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing times. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum blockchain, changes in processing times are hard for ÐApp developers to predict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build random forest models to understand the factors that are associated with transaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture blockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction issuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas pricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing times. Based on our empirical results, we provide ÐApp developers with concrete insights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

For the evaluation, the authors developed an automatic tool with a test suite based on the proposed functional specifications. The authors' experiment revealed that no top-100 market capitalization token smart contracts turned out to agree perfectly based on the functional specifications. In addition, the authors found the de facto standard behaviour deduced through testing with the functional specifications and suggested a possible countermeasure for the compliance problem in dealing with multiple tokens together. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The number of internet-connected devices has been exponentially growing with the massive volume of heterogeneous data generated from various devices, resulting in a highly intertwined cyber-physical system. Currently, the Edge Intelligence System (EIS) concept that leverages the merits of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is utilized to provide smart cloud services with powerful computational processing and reduce decision-making delays. Thus, EIS offers a possible solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in a vehicular network framework. However, since the central aggregator server is responsible for supervising the entire system orchestration, the existing EIS framework faces several challenges and is still potentially susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. Hence, to solve the issues mentioned earlier, this paper presents the notion of secure edge intelligence, merging the benefits of Federated Learning (FL), blockchain, and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). The blockchain-assisted FL approach is used to efficiently improve traffic prediction accuracy and enhance user privacy and security by recording transactions in immutable distributed ledger networks as well as providing a decentralized reward mechanism system. Furthermore, LDP is empowered to strengthen the confidentiality of data sharing transactions, especially in protecting the user’s private data from various attacks. The proposed framework has been implemented in two scenarios, i.e., blockchain-based FL to efficiently develop the decentralized traffic management for vehicular networks and LDP-based FL to produce the randomized privacy protection using the IBM Library for differential privacy. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Software licenses are legal agreements of sale and usage among software developers and clients. Such legal agreements are crucial to effectively manage ownership and protect the rights of involved parties. Today's software licensing mechanisms are mostly centralized and do not address the ever-increasing issues and complexities of modern software that may include multiple licenses, open-source distribution, rewarding other contributors of external software libraries, and utilizing royalty payments for monetization. As a result, developers have lost confidence in the existing software licensing models, and many software projects are failing due to lack of funding and royalty payments. This paper addresses such issues and complexities by proposing a novel decentralized software licensing system based on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. The proposed licensing system is applicable to both commercial and open-source software. We use NFTs as digital tokens that encapsulate software code and their artifacts by minting them as unique valuable assets that allow developers to store and manage them on a blockchain ledger. With NFTs, developers can register and license their code, monetize it on NFT marketplaces, and earn royalties from other software projects that use their code. We present system architecture, relevant sequence diagrams, and develop aggregation algorithms for Ethereum smart contracts with ERC-1155 NFTs. Furthermore, we perform functional validation of our system and analyze the cost of its adoption. We also analyze the security of the solution and show how its applicability can be generalized and extended. We have made our smart contract code and related testing scripts publicly available on GitHub.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the main concerns of cybersecurity is the detection of hoaxes across social media. Hoaxers propagate such messages to mislead users and to promote violence. Several approaches exist in literature to address this issue. They are mainly limited to detect hoax activities by characterizing the message nature and detecting provenance of messages. However, unless hoaxes are detected, they continue to propagate across social media nodes. This work aims at reducing the dissemination of hoaxes across group of users. Relying on social graph structure, this research develops a mechanism based on smart contract logics to prevent a group to consume a fake post. To achieve this objective, we used a smart contract to exploit a trust index computed based on message characteristics and group features such as graph density, group status, group degree, group acceptability. Based on the value of trust index, the message is forwarded or blocked. Experiments realized on groups of different characteristics revealed that the proposed smart contract is even able to reactively block a fake post of the same nature than the group type. Results indicate that the proportion of targeted groups could be reduced even if their interests match with the message subject. This research is an important step forward to anti-promote hoaxes with the novelty of exploiting smart contract approach to contain their propagation. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Emerging multitenant cloud computing ecosystems allow multiple applications to share virtualized pool of computing and networking resources. As a result, such ecosystems are becoming increasingly prone to data privacy concerns (personal data leakages and unauthorized access). While cloud computing providers support robust security and privacy mechanisms (e.g., public key cryptography, firewalls, and virtual private networks, among many others), they lack mechanisms and frameworks to monitor, audit, and verify these data privacy concerns. The emergence of data protection regulations around the world, such as General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the Data Protection Act in the U.K., further emphasizes the need to overcome these privacy limitations. In this article, a novel technique for monitoring, auditing, and verifying the operations carried out on a user's personal data in cloud computing ecosystems is proposed. Our research methodology leverages distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain and smart contracts) for developing an immutable recording technique, which transparently logs, monitors, and verifies the operations carried out on user data. Using a healthcare pharmacy scenario and extensive real-world experiments, we validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. The proposed work handles a large pool of requests ($>$13K) ensuring minimal latency ($\approx$50-60 ms) and overheads for three different service packages varied with respect to the number of actors and operations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an information carrier based on the Internet and traditional telecommunications networks. Access control is an important part of the service architecture, which can effectively solve the security issues in IoT. Therefore, many solutions adopt the access control to solve some security problems. However, these existing solutions cannot easily deploy access control in the IoT. As a decentralized, non-tamperable, and highly credible distributed ledger technology, blockchain is in line with the current trend of network development. To improve the transparency, non-tampering of the access control process and traceability and auditability of access flow changes, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the IoT, which uses a combination of on-chain and off-chain to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain. On the one hand, we deploy policy decision points (PDP) and other components on the smart contract in the form of chain code to better judge and execute decision-making. On the other hand, we put policy administration points (PAP) in the off-chain organization to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain and make better access flow transformation and traceability. Ultimately, we concluded through feasibility analysis that our solution can maintain high throughput in a large-scale transaction volume environment. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to aggressive urbanization (with population size), waste increases exponentially, resulting in environmental damage. Even though it looks challenging, such an issue can be controlled if we can reuse them. To handle this, in our work, we design a machine learning and blockchain-oriented system that identifies the waste objects/products and recommends to the user multiple 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) ideas to reuse or recycle. Blockchain records every transaction in the shared ledger to enable transaction verifiability and supports better decision-making. In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on about 11700 images is developed using ResNet50 architecture for object recognition (training accuracy of 94%). We deploy several smart contracts in the Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain platform to validate recommended DIY ideas by blockchain network members. HF is a decentralized ledger technology platform that executes the deployed smart contracts in a secured Docker container to initialize and manage the ledger state. The complete model is delivered on a web platform using Flask, where our recommendation system works on a web scraping script written using Python. Fetching DIY ideas using web-scraping takes nearly 1 second on a desktop machine with an Intel Core-i7 processor with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, installed with Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system, and Python 3.6 package. Further, we evaluate blockchain-based smart contracts' latencies and throughput performances using the hyperledger caliper benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates blockchain technology and deep learning for the DIY recommender system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decentralized services and applications provide a multitude of advantages for their users, such as improved privacy, control, and independence from third parties. Anyhow, decentralization comes at the cost of certain disadvantages, such as increased application complexity or communication overhead. This aggravates the development and deployment of decentralized services and applications. In this paper we present Blade, a software platform that aims to ease the effort of development and deployment of decentralized services by implementing reusable solutions for recurring challenges developers are facing when designing decentralized service architectures. Blade implements such functionality in a Blade server instance, which can be deployed on a lightweight device, such as a NAS, Raspberry Pi, or router at home. This allows users without expert knowledge to run a Blade instance with already existing hardware with little overhead. Blade supports polyglot Blade modules that implement extended functionality, such as interfaces, frontends, and business logic of decentralized applications. Blade modules are installed via a decentralized, Ethereum-based marketplace that can be accessed via the Blade instances. For identity management, Blade relays on smart contracts, which implement an Ethereum-based registry. This allows users to create and manage their identities in a self-sovereign manner without the need of a central entity. This way, Blade builds a decentralized service ecosystem that supports developers of decentralized applications and services. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology in recent years, all kinds of blockchain-based applications have emerged. Among them, the decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which is regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the real-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. However, due to the deterministic nature of blockchain, the blockchain cannot directly obtain indeterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have appeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain applications. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study on oracles, especially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application scenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by categorizing them into several types based on their design features. After that, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use (such as Chainlink and Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data validation process, and their incentive mechanisms. Then, we compare these present DeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness, data source trustworthiness and their overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing trustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a few promising techniques for building future trustworthiness oracles.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Billions of dollars lost has been recorded over the past decade due to the overproduction and underconsumption of medical supplies. The overproducation and underconsumption are usually due to the lack of accountability, transparency, traceability, audit, assessment, security, and trust features in the current healthcare supply chain systems. It is required to ensure that everyone is getting a fair share of medical supplies without unnecessary waste. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that ensures the commitment and accountability of all participants to prevent them from producing any unnecessary waste. We introduce five phases, such as registration, commitment, production, delivery, and consumption, to perform the waste assessment accurately and fairly. We develop four smart contracts that ensure data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability while recording all actions on an immutable ledger automatically. We utilize offchain decentralized storage to deal with the large data problem. We present five algorithms and discuss each phase of the proposed solution, along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct the security analysis to ensure that our smart contracts are secure enough and they do not have vulnerabilities and flaws. The smart contracts code is made publicly available on GitHub.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been pervasively researched nowadays and it has been applied in many aspects of real life. Nevertheless, issues of model and data still accompany the development of ML. For instance, training of traditional ML models is limited to the access of data sets, which are generally proprietary; published ML models may soon be out of date without an update of new data and continuous training; malicious data contributors may upload wrongly labeled data that leads to undesirable training results; and the abuse of private data and data leakage also exist. With the utilization of blockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey the convergence of collaborative ML and blockchain. Different ways of the combination of these two technologies are investigated and their fields of application are examined.

	abstract = {Social data produced from widely emerged social media activities are expected to promote information dissemination and engagement, or even make business intelligence more powerful. However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. In this article, we present SocialChain, which is a decentralized social data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and social applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the social data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner. We develop a software prototype based on Ethereum and conduct case studies to test the effects of the adopted techniques on the performance. Experimental results show that SocialChain can provide easy-to-use interfaces while introducing relatively low latency, cost, and overhead and that it can support real-world social media applications.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and verification of a blockchain-based online electronic voting system that ensures accuracy and reliability in electronic voting and its application to various types of voting using blockchain technologies, such as distributed ledgers and smart contracts. Specifically, in this study, the connection between the electronic voting system and blockchain nodes is simplified using the REST API design, and the voting opening and counting information is designed to store the latest values in the distributed ledger in JSON format, using a smart contract that cannot be falsified. The developed electronic voting system can provide blockchain authentication, secret voting, forgery prevention, ballot verification, and push notification functions, all of which are currently not supported in existing services. Furthermore, the developed system demonstrates excellence on all evaluation items, including 101 transactions per second (TPS) of blockchain online authentication, 57.6 TPS of secret voting services, 250 TPS of forgery prevention cases, 547 TPS of read transaction processing, and 149 TPS of write transaction processing, along with 100% ballot verification service, secret ballot authentication, and encryption accuracy. Functional and performance verifications were obtained through an external test certification agency in South Korea. Our design allows for blockchain authentication, non-forgery of ballot counting data, and secret voting through blockchain-based distributed ledger technology. In addition, we demonstrate how existing electronic voting systems can be easily converted to blockchain-based electronic voting systems by applying a blockchain-linked REST API. This study greatly contributes to enabling electronic voting using blockchain technology through cost reductions, information restoration, prevention of misrepresentation, and transparency enhancement for a variety of different forms of voting.

	abstract = {A blockchain is a data structure that is implemented as a distrusted database or digital ledger. The transactions are saved to a block of transactions that is attached in turn to the blockchain after the verification process, in which each block in the chain contains a hash signature of the previous block in addition to the hash signature of the block itself. The blocks on the blockchain are chained as an immutable list using the proof-of-work procedure, where there is no way to alter or delete an attached block due to the strict security policy used for structuring the chain of blocks. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain in which the miners take the responsibility of verifying and attaching blocks to the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain introduced the smart contract which holds logic to be processed once the contract is established. These smart contracts are developed via the Solidity programming language. This proposed paper exploits the Ethereum blockchain along with smart contracts as the base technology for implementing the proposed blockchain-based model. The paper aims to develop a multilayered blockchain-based model, in which the blockchain model is set up on a private blockchain Ethereum network where the nodes share the electronic medical records (EMR) among the P2P (peer-to-peer) network that will be used to secure the IoT medical transactions. Solidity smart contract, introduced by Ethereum, is deployed to handle the EMR “open-query-transfer” operations on the private network, whereas the miners are responsible to validate the transactions. Finally, the research conducts a performance analysis of the Ethereum network using the Ethereum Caliper, considering several performance factors, which are: Maximum Latency, Minimum Latency, Average Latency, and Throughput. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), technological developments have increased the significance of federated cloud systems with integrated cloud providers for exchange transactions. Monolithic IoT systems implement service-oriented architecture (SOA), which is complex for supporting scalability and communicating transactions in a federated cloud system. One weakness of conventional security methods is that they depend on a centralized party, which means there is a single point of failure for the system. In contrast, blockchain (BC) and microservice (MS) technologies allow services to split for independent tasks. In this research paper, we introduce BC security managers based on MS technology for federated cloud systems in an IoT environment. In addition, we present the design of the Federation Security System Manager (FSSM) MS with interoperability features. This enables the exchange of transactions between permissioned BC managers at different cloud providers, with some constraints. Furthermore, a security framework based on MSs and BCs is implemented to ensure security and protect access control. The security functions are deployed based on a smart contract between the permissioned BC managers to achieve interoperability. Finally, we introduce the development process of the proposed framework, which allows for interoperability and ensures the security and privacy of the participating data for a distributed IoT based on the federated cloud system. © 2023 by the authors.},

Our goal in this dissertation study is to expand the space of security vulnerabilities detection by proposing effective static analysis approaches for smart contracts. We study the effectiveness of the existing static analysis tools and propose solutions for security vulnerabilities detection relying on analyzing the dependency of the contract code on user inputs that lead to security vulnerabilities.

	abstract = {The revolution of Malaysian Construction 4.0 through emerging technologies has brought a paradigm shift that has digitalized the construction sector. There is a need to adopt a computerized protocol to assist in automating the performance of a contract to meet future digital challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to serve as a pioneer study to investigate the implementation of the Malaysian construction industry to adopt smart contracts. This study adopted a qualitative scientific methodology, whereby a systematic review was conducted to gather the benefits and challenges of implementing smart contracts in the construction industry. Further, interview sessions were arranged to collect data from the construction contract management experts. The research findings unveil that due to the self-executing attribute of smart contracts, the implementation of smart contracts could provide a better apportionment of risks in a contract. The study also finds that the challenges in implementing smart contracts are severe. For instance, the smart contract is irreversible and immutable and prone to human error. The study concludes that it is more suitable to apply and implement a smart contract to a short-term contract that is not subjected to variation. Furthermore, a smart contract can enhance the efficiency in managing the contracts, such as reducing time and managing the conflicts and disputes that arise during the contract duration. The developed implementation framework is significant for the construction personnel, especially those dealing with the contract administration. The implementation of smart contracts in construction could boost contract administration and management discipline via investment in this new technology. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things technology, the use of Internet of Things is expanding, and its security risk will become an important factor restricting the development of Internet of Things technology. The application of blockchain technology in the security field of the Internet of Things can improve security problems, and the blockchain has immutable characteristics. Therefore, it is particularly important to ensure the security of blockchain smart contracts. However, the order of transaction in smart contracts is easy to be operated by miners, and there is a relative lack of tools to detect TOD (transaction-ordering dependent) vulnerabilities. The current smart contract vulnerability detection methods have the problems of low efficiency and low accuracy. Therefore, based on the study of TOD vulnerability principle, this paper creatively highlights a mutation fuzzy testing method EtherFuzz to specifically detect TOD vulnerability in smart contracts. Use the intelligent contract ABI (application binary interface) to generate test cases, test the byte code of the intelligent contract, use TOD to test oracle to detect TOD vulnerabilities, and then, mutate the tested data to generate new test cases. Finally, the behavior of smart contract operation is recorded, and the fuzzy test process is controlled until the vulnerability is detected. The experimental results show that when 987 token contracts are selected as Ethereum test objects, the false-positive rate, detection time overhead, and detection storage overhead of EtherFuzz are reduced by 74.4%, 30.1%, and 28.1%, respectively. Therefore, EtherFuzz has high speed, efficiency, and accuracy in detecting TOD vulnerabilities and has excellent application value.  © 2022 Xiaoyin Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Ranking systems have proven to improve the quality of education and help build the reputation of academic institutions. Each of the current academic ranking systems is based on different methodologies, criteria, and standards of measurement. Academic and employer reputations are subjective indicators of some rankings determined through surveying that is neither transparent nor traceable. The current academic ranking systems fall short of providing transparency and traceability features for both subjective and objective indicators that are used to calculate the ranking. Also, the ranking systems are managed and controlled in a centralized manner by specific entities. This raises concerns about fairness and trust. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution to enable transparent, traceable, trusted, and decentralized academic ranking systems. We develop smart contracts to automatically govern entity interactions according to set policies. We leverage decentralized storage, oracles, and threshold encryption to securely fetch, store, and share institutions&#x2019; ranking data. We present algorithms along with their implementation and testing details, as well as validate smart contracts. The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of cost, throughput and latency, and security to show its affordability, resiliency against attacks, and superiority. All developed smart contract codes are made publicly available on GitHub. Author},

	abstract = {In recent years, the internet of things (IoT) growth has brought about many technological changes, including the emergence of the notion of the smart city. The development of a smart city requires the integration of IoT devices and information and communication technologies to improve the quality of lives of citizens in many areas such as health, economy, business, agriculture, and transport. However, with this evolution, many cybersecurity risks and challenges have been raised, so it is necessary to develop these technologies in a protected way to avoid being compromised by attackers. Blockchain, being a new technology based on cryptographic principles, can play an important role in securing smart cities. In this survey, we discussed different applications of blockchain technology in smart cities and also studied how blockchain features (transparency, democracy, decentralization, and security) can help in the improvement of smart city services. This analysis will help us to implement an electronic voting model using a smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain to highlight how blockchain technology can be implemented in smart cities to promote security. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {In recent decades, the world has witnessed cloud computing as an essential technology that changes the traditional application Development and Operation (DevOps) lifecycle. However, current cloud software DevOps and Service Level Agreement (SLA) management often face challenges of 1) selecting the best fitting service providers, customizing services and planning capacities for large-scale distributed applications; 2) guaranteeing high-quality and trustworthy SLAs among multiple service providers; 3) enhancing the interoperability of cloud services across different providers; and 4) designing effective incentive models among stakeholders. This paper proposes a novel framework called Auction and Witness Enhanced trustworthy SLA for Open, decentralized service MarkEtplaces (AWESOME) to build a trustworthy cloud marketplace and address the above challenges. The proposed framework contains four subsystems: a customizable graphical user interface, an auction-based service selection model, a witness committee management mechanism, and a smart contract factory orchestration. We developed a prototype AWESOME decentralized application (DApp) based on the Ethereum blockchain. Extensive experiments are designed to evaluate the latency and cost of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is economical and feasible. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is now regarded as one of the most interesting and possibly innovative technologies. It enables information to be stored and exchanged securely and transparently without the need for a centralized authority to regulate it. Some of the primary benefits of this technology are the atomicity of the stored data. Given its features, this technology has the potential to provide answers to challenges encountered in a very sensitive sector, namely, Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In IoV, vehicles and service providers autonomously capture and produce data without human intervention. This exchanged data must meet certain criteria such as decentralization, automation, security, and stakeholder trust management. To overcome these challenges, the integration of blockchain technology and multi-agent systems is a key solution. Based on smart contracts, the proposed solution consists of exploiting role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) techniques. This solution removes the central authority (CA) to reduce maintenance costs and eliminate legacy threats from centralized systems. The results, obtained from consumption costs, show that the developed platform is characterized by security, availability, and privacy.  © 2022 Halima Mhamdi et al.},

	abstract = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Internet decentralization nowadays represents a critical topic to be addressed. It protects the users' privacy, promotes data ownership, eliminates single points of failure and data censorship. An element that has an important role in decentralization is blockchain technology. Although blockchain has revolutionised sectors like the financial one with Bitcoin, there are still some fields where it needs to be further developed. One of these is geospatial data sharing and citizen science, where features like decentralization, immutability and transparency are needed. This study focuses on the description of a decentralized application developed specifically for geospatial data-point sharing and validation. As an example, the Informative System for the Integrated Monitoring of Insubric Lakes and their Ecosystems (SIMILE) is used. This application is developed in the Velas blockchain infrastructure and implements a combination of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) with smart contracts. Two types of smart contracts were created, a cell and a registry smart contract. The cell smart contracts are individual for each DGGS partition and contain the list of observations present in a specific area. The registry smart contracts keep track of all the DGGS cells added to the system. Currently, SIMILE observations are validated by public authorities, which requires time that is not always available. Therefore, a fully working prototype was developed to solve this. Here users can add and manage personal observations and validate the ones belonging to other users. This work demonstrates the feasibility of creating decentralized applications for geographical data validation as a citizen science solution. © Copyright:},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the slowdown of the global economy and the instability of the stock market and real estate market, the art market has gradually become the third-largest investment market after the former two. As more and more funds flow into the art market, the two seemingly unrelated industries, art, and finance have increasingly close cooperation due to the growing prosperity of the art market. As a very important part of the process of art financialization, the development of art banks has also received extensive attention from all walks of life. In addition, blockchain, as a technology to jointly maintain reliable databases through trustlessness and decentralization, has grown rapidly in recent years, and is gradually applied in various fields. The advantages of blockchain technology are decentralization, anonymity, immutability, and traceability of stored information. The proposed scheme applies the characteristics of blockchain technology to Art Bank’s art rental system, and will have the following advantages: the use of Hyperledger technology, various art banks being merged into an alliance, and information among alliance members being shared, which is convenient for tenants to comprehensively query a single item. Using blockchain technology, in an environment where there is no central authority, under the premise of preventing the tampering of artwork-related information, ensures that the detailed information of the artwork is shared. Traditional leasing agreements can be compiled into smart contract leasing contracts to automatically run and manipulate data. The proposed protocol satisfies the following security requirements: identities’ mutual authentication, non-repudiation between every two parties, and other major security requirements based on blockchain. When a dispute arises, our proposed scheme also has an arbitration mechanism to clarify responsibilities. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, the development of blockchain technology has also been deeply impacted. When performing block verification in the blockchain network, if all transactions are verified on the chain, this will cause the accumulation of data on the chain, resulting in data storage problems. At the same time, the security of data is also challenged, which will put enormous pressure on the block, resulting in extremely low communication efficiency of the block. The traditional blockchain system uses theMerkle Tree method to store data.While verifying the integrity and correctness of the data, the amount of proof is large, and it is impossible to verify the data in batches. A large amount of data proof will greatly impact the verification efficiency, which will cause end-to-end communication delays and seriously affect the blockchain system's stability, efficiency, and security. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes to replace the Merkle tree with polynomial commitments, which take advantage of the properties of polynomials to reduce the proof size and communication consumption. By realizing the ingenious use of aggregated proof and smart contracts, the verification efficiency of blocks is improved, and the pressure of node communication is reduced. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain technology has appeared as a powerful decentralized tool for data integrity protection. The use of smart contracts in blockchain helped to provide a secure environment for developing peer-to-peer applications. Blockchain has been used by the research community as a tool for protection against attacks. The blockchain itself can be the objective of many cyberthreats. In the literature, there are few research works aimed to protect the blockchain against cyberthreats adopting, in most cases, statistical schemes based on smart contracts and causing deployment and runtime overheads. Although, the power of machine learning tools there is insufficient use of these techniques to protect blockchain against attacks. For that reason, we aim, in this paper, to propose a new framework called BChainGuard for cyberthreat detection in blockchain. Our framework’s main goal is to distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior of the traffic linked to the blockchain network. In BChainGuard, the execution of the classification technique will be local. Next, we embed only the decision function as a smart contract. The experimental result shows encouraging results with an accuracy of detection of around 95% using SVM and 98.02% using MLP with a low runtime and overhead in terms of consumed gas. © 2022 by the authors.},

On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people.

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology whose transactions can be recorded in a decentralised and immutable ledger. Several applications were developed in the last few years for blockchain based - traceability systems. Most of the work concentrated on information retrieval and system scalability. Still, promising research has not been seen for a blockchain traceability system with user identification methods. This work presents a blockchain system with user identification and access control mechanisms to fill the gap for each supply chain participant. In addition, the system also proposes a novel Proof of Transaction (PoTx) consensus algorithm designed to achieve scalability with reduced communication overhead and computation power. A novel PoTx algorithm is developed by choosing a random validator from a consensus group based on the transaction count to enforce the fault-tolerance of the system. The proposed system with user identification method allows to prevent and identify product adulteration while tracing the agriculture product.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Group Key Exchange (GKE) is an important tool to develop secure multi-user applications such as group text messages, ad-hoc networks, and so on. Most of the currently deployed GKE schemes are synchronous, i.e., they require all the participants to be online during their execution. However, with more battery-powered devices being used in such applications, the synchronicity requirement is challenging to fulfill. To fill the gaps, asynchronous GKE schemes have been introduced in the literature. Nevertheless, the currently available asynchronous and synchronous GKE schemes rely on Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) for key establishment and management. To this end, reliance on TTPs is a serious shortcoming since TTPs are well known to be the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing GKE schemes require participants to perform all computations, which can degrade the performance of resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an asynchronous GKE scheme that uses blockchain and smart contracts to store the security keys-related material and reduce the computational load of the participants. Furthermore, our proposed scheme provides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Post-Compromised Security (PCS). Our implementation on Ethereum shows that the proposed scheme can scale to more than 100 participants when combined with a distributed storage system. Author},

	abstract = {The detection of smart contracts vulnerability is a valuable research problem because smart contracts hold a huge amount of cryptocurrency. In the past, popular detection tools were mainly based on some traditional techniques such as fuzzing and symbolic execution, which rely on fixed expert features or patterns and often miss many vulnerabilities. Recent machine learning approaches alleviate this issue but do not notice the semantic information in the source code. In this paper, we develop a system called SVChecker to classify the smart contract source code written in Solidity. To show the superiority of our system, we conduct experiments on more than 40,000 smart contracts collected from Ethereum. Empirically, our experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms all popular detection tools.  © The Authors.},

	abstract = {Compiler correctness is an old problem, but with the emergence of smart contracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control (valuable) assets in an adversarial environment; once committed to the blockchain, these smart contracts cannot be modified. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler has correctly translated the source code to the given low-level code. Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also squarely addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate a modular verification methodology and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler implementation. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Digital data has enabled organizations to anticipate future threats, opportunities, and trends. However, digital data owners do not know how their data is accessed, shared, and monitized. In this paper, we propose using blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable time-bound access and monitization of private data. Our approach allows users to upload encrypted content and mint it into NFTs. Other users can access the NFTs' content by requesting a purchase or a license. Purchasing content transfers the ownership of the NFTs to the buyer; whereas, licensing them permits accessing the private data for a limited period of time, after which the data gets automatically deleted. Our developed approach uses the decentralized application (DApp), proxy reencryption (PRE), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and trusted execution environment (TEE) for managing a fully decentralized and robust system. We implement a proof-of-concept system in an Ethereum-based environment, which is used for testing and vulnerability checks. We present the cost and security analyses and discuss the generalization aspect of the solution. Our smart contracts and testing scripts are publicly available under an open-source license. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, and blockchain technology were combined to develop a vehicle-to-everything blockchain power trading and energy management platform with the objective of enabling multi-level power transactions for electric vehicle charging stations in or between commercial buildings. The proposed platform considers green power transactions across microgrids, bidirectional power and green power charging and discharging transactions in microgrids, demand response bidding, and vehicle-to-vehicle emergency rescue charging. This innovative architecture operates smart contracts and distributed ledgers independently; uses smart contracts to handle bidding, matching, and settlement of the power trading platform; and simultaneously employs the cloud and local distributed ledger nodes to chain the detailed real-time transaction information and power data on the ledger. In this manner, the security and fairness of data can be ensured; furthermore, a large amount of chaining information can be processed, and the chaining latency can be shortened. In addition, the communication protocols are integrated through the artificial intelligence of things. An energy management system (EMS) is proposed, which can perform optimal charging and discharging scheduling according to the power transaction matching results and then control charging piles and energy storage system devices. It can reduce the operating cost of microgrids in commercial buildings, increase the efficiency of green power utilization, and reduce power loss. In this system, power transactions are automatically and simultaneously executed in the EMS to achieve real-time supply and demand balance of regional microgrids.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since its inception more than a decade ago, blockchain technology has been quickly adopted by a large number of sectors, including finance, healthcare, energy supply, and logistics, due to its numerous benefits, such as decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. However, blockchain applications are intrinsically complex, as they are heterogeneous in nature and require cooperation and interoperation with non-blockchain systems. The complexity of the blockchain systems is further exacerbated by the lack of a clear understanding of their composition. This paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing a taxonomy for characterizing blockchain systems. The proposed taxonomy classifies a blockchain system into a hierarchy of components: At the top level, the system is organized into an external subsystem, an internal subsystem and an execution environment subsystem. These subsystems are then decomposed into eight fundamental components: Platform, Network, Distributed Ledger, Smart Contract, Consensus Protocol, Digital Wallet, Token, and Node. Each component is further divided into different aspects and each aspect is characterized by various features. This taxonomy thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the composition of a blockchain system, which can better inform software developers in their design and implementation of blockchain systems. The paper presents and illustrates the proposed taxonomy through some application scenarios and a case study.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts can support the decentralisation of business processes, but due to smart contracts’ specifics, their development is a complicated process. Introducing model-driven development principles in smart contract development can facilitate requirement specification, design, and implementation activities. This paper presents a model-driven development method MDAsmartCD (Model-Driven Architecture-based Smart Contract Development) to alleviate smart contract development by supporting the complete MDA life cycle, covering the definition of Computation-Independent Model, Platform-Independent Model, and two instances of Platform-Specific Models. In MDAsmartCD, model transformations (model-to-model and model-to-text) are used to produce smart contract code in the Hyperledger Fabric platform Go and the Ethereum platform Solidity programming languages. The method application was demonstrated by implementing the smart contract for the hackathon solution and executing the generated Solidity and Go smart contracts in the workflow of issuing certificates for hackathon participants. During the execution of the workflow, both deployed smart contracts behaved identically and recorded analogous results in respective blockchain data storages. This demonstrated that the MDAsmartCD method enables the generation of compilable and executable smart contract code, ready for deployment on a blockchain platform. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study aims to build a proposed model in order to transform an old system into a Blockchain-based system. The smallholder oil palm supply chain currently uses a traditional information system and technology, hence its integrity, transparency, and security are vulnerable. To solve this problem, frontier technology is needed, such as a blockchain, which has trust, transparency, and traceable characteristics to improve performance and quality. The method used in this study was digital transformation in the context of operational processes and technology. In addition, the As-Is To-Be model was used as a mechanism to develop a transformation model for the smallholder oil palm supply chain system. Specifically, the As-Is model was implemented in identifying and analyzing the information system and technology in an already existing system, while the To-Be was used to determine the blockchain potential and characteristics. This becomes the proposed model for the transformation of the old system into a Blockchain technology-based. Also, a prospective and mechanism for system transformation were produced in the aspect of transactions, data, and architecture, as well as the flow of change strategies needed in the transformation of the blockchain-based smallholder oil palm supply chain system. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system.

The latest example is the COVID-19 pandemic that got the world into a heated race to contain by developing immunization vaccines. Many of the vaccines came into production in record time which raises questions about their side effects. Also, since vaccines are sensitive medical products, they require continuous cold supply chain monitoring and tracking. It is clear how vital it is to link any occurring side effects to their causes to determine whether it is a manufacturing problem or a supply chain management issue. Additionally, and to properly establish this link, an effective beneficiaries' registration process is required. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive system that combines vaccines cold supply chain management solution with side-effects follow-up data and individuals registration records. To achieve these goals, the technology of blockchain was selected to develop a framework for the vaccines program. Blockchain is known as the architecture behind cryptocurrencies, however, it proved its reliability and effectiveness in different use cases. Blockchain special characteristics were the reason behind adopting it to establish a blockchain-based platform for vaccines cold supply chain associated with traceable side-effects information records combined with beneficiaries registration data. The connection between the three parts of our system framework is important to achieving the utmost benefits out of the vaccine program in terms of compliance with standard measures and its link to side-effects and beneficiaries metadata.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of sensors that helps collect data 24/7 withouthuman intervention. However, the network may suffer from problems such as the low battery,heterogeneity, and connectivity issues due to the lack of standards. Even though these problemscan cause several performance hiccups, security issues need immediate attention because hackersaccess vital personal and financial information and then misuse it. These security issues can allowhackers to hijack IoT devices and then use them to establish a Botnet to launch a Distributed Denial ofService (DDoS) attack. Blockchain technology can provide security to IoT devices by providing secureauthentication using public keys. Similarly, Smart Contracts (SCs) can improve the performance of theIoT–blockchain network through automation. However, surveyed work shows that the blockchainand SCs do not provide foolproof security; sometimes, attackers defeat these security mechanisms andinitiate DDoS attacks. Thus, developers and security software engineers must be aware of differenttechniques to detect DDoS attacks. In this survey paper, we highlight different techniques to detectDDoS attacks. The novelty of our work is to classify the DDoS detection techniques according toblockchain technology. As a result, researchers can enhance their systems by using blockchain-basedsupport for detecting threats. In addition, we provide general information about the studied systemsand their workings. However, we cannot neglect the recent surveys. To that end, we compare thestate-of-the-art DDoS surveys based on their data collection techniques and the discussed DDoSattacks on the IoT subsystems. The study of different IoT subsystems tells us that DDoS attacks alsoimpact other computing systems, such as SCs, networking devices, and power grids. Hence, ourwork briefly describes DDoS attacks and their impacts on the above subsystems and IoT. For instance,due to DDoS attacks, the targeted computing systems suffer delays which cause tremendous financialand utility losses to the subscribers. Hence, we discuss the impacts of DDoS attacks in the contextof associated systems. Finally, we discuss Machine-Learning algorithms, performance metrics, andthe underlying technology of IoT systems so that the readers can grasp the detection techniquesand the attack vectors. Moreover, associated systems such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN)and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are a source of good security enhancement for IoTNetworks. Thus, we include a detailed discussion of future development encompassing all major IoTsubsystems. © 2022 by the authors.},

However, there are several critical challenges which IoUT system designers must consider such as (1) scalability of the system to handle large volumes of oceanic data and (2) security of data that is transmitted from IoT sensors deployed underwater. Blockchain as a newly emerged technology and an enabling platform allows decentralized and secure transmission of data among a wide group of untrustworthy parties. This research aims to exploit blockchain technology to secure IoUT data transmission by exploiting Interplanetary File System (IPFS) method. Additionally, this study also addresses the system’s scalability in two aspects, (1) scalability, and (2) security. We used a case study-based approach and performed experiments to evaluate the proposed solution’s usability and efficiency in terms of query response (i.e., performance), and algorithmic execution (i.e., efficiency). The proposed solution unifies blockchain technologies to secure IoT-driven systems and provides guidelines to engineer and develop next-generation of robust and secure blockchain-aided distributed IoT systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The increased use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices - from basic sensors to robust embedded computers - has boosted the demand for information processing and storing solutions closer to these devices. Edge computing has been established as a standard architecture for developing IoT solutions, since it can optimize the workload and capacity of systems that depend on cloud services by deploying necessary computing power close to where the information is being produced and consumed. However, as the network scale in size, reaching consensus becomes an increasingly challenging task. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), which can be described as a network of distributed databases that incorporate cryptography, can be leveraged to achieve consensus among participants. In recent years DLTs have gained traction due to the popularity of blockchains, the most-well known type of implementation. The reliability and trust that can be achieved through transparent and traceable transactions are other key concepts that bring IoT and DLT together. We present the design, development and conducted experiments of a proof-of-concept system that uses DLT smart contracts for efficiently selecting edge nodes for offloading computational tasks. In particular, we integrate network performance indicators in smart contracts with a Hyperledger Blockchain to optimize the offloading on computation under dynamic connectivity solutions. The proposed method can be applied to networks with varied topologies and different means of connectivity. Our results show the applicability of blockchain smart contracts to a variety of industrial use cases.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present the results from a systematic mapping study to give structure to the information found from primary sources. Systematic mapping is a well-known method to identify and categorize research papers in a field with an increasing amount of literature. For this systematic mapping, we searched for studies between 2017 and present-day (March 2022) and were able to find 303 results, from which 47 were selected, by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, to be relevant to this study. A concept map was created from the information gathered from primary sources to the attributes such as research type, contribution type, blockchain network, smart contract language, development process, testing methods, and testing environment. We also categorized the trends and demographics found in the selected papers based on publication year, author's country, and more.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted many industries, in particular the healthcare sector exposing systemic vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and supply chain management. A major challenge during the pandemic was related to the increased demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), resulting in critical shortages for healthcare and frontline workers. This is due to the lack of information visibility combined with the inability to precisely track product movement within the supply chain, requiring a robust traceability solution. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology to manage and track PPE products in the supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform PPE supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We present detailed cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution for PPE supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The present study analyzes recent changes concerning the benefits, disadvantages, challenges, and opportunities of blockchain applications in agribusiness. Interviews were conducted with and a questionnaire was applied to professionals working in the development and application of blockchain technology in agribusiness, to compare their perception of the recent advances. The results showed that the importance of blockchain technology to improve governance and information flow along supply chains has increased, and this is the main perceived benefit. The main disadvantages were removing intermediaries and the high cost of implementing the technology. The absence of a widely accepted platform in blockchain operations is the leading and growing challenge, while patterns for blockchain technology seem to be being overcome. The integration of blockchain with new technologies, and the competitiveness provided by the technology, are seen as the main and growing opportunities.

	abstract = {Mobile service providers (MSPs) are particularly vulnerable to roaming frauds, especially ones that exploit the long delay in the data exchange process of the contemporary roaming management systems, causing multi-billion dollars loss each year. In this paper, we introduce BlockRoam, a novel blockchain-based roaming management system that provides an efficient data exchange platform among MSPs and mobile subscribers. Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an effective method to guarantee the uniqueness of this game's equilibrium. The performance evaluations show that the proposed economic model helps the MSPs to earn additional profits, attracts more investment to the blockchain network, and enhances the network's security and performance.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {By the development and advancement of blockchain technique, Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation driven devices and the application of blockchain-enabled IoT alter the view and operating infrastructure of the smart networks. The blockchain is responsible for supporting decentralized systems and offers secured means of authentication, management, and access to IoT system thereby deploying smart contracts offered by Ethereum. The increasing demand and the blockchain expansion generate huge volume of sensitive data. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Furthermore, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are regarded as the most promising threats for smart contracts in the blockchain-based systems. Therefore, there is a need to detect and classify the attack type and the data should be stored in server more securely with the use of blockchain and data aggregation method. For this purpose, this presented technique aims at introducing decentralized consensus blockchain and Interplanetary file system (IPFS) based data aggregation for effective classification and data storage. The attack is detected using meta-hyperparameter random forest (MHP-RF) classifier. Once the attack is detected, the transaction information is stored in server securely by means of smart contract-based blockchain system. The transaction handling stage classifies the transaction type as normal or abnormal one which then followed by execution of business logic by smart contract thereby appending the transaction of blockchain in the network cloud. The consensus blockchain technique is employed with the use of PoW-enabled scheme integrated with Elgamal-based data aggregation. Therefore, the system security is improved and the intrusion is prevented greatly. The performance analysis of the system is analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, Encryption time, decryption time, execution time, and space complexity. The attained outcomes are compared with traditional approaches to prove the effectiveness of proposed strategy. The proposed system is said to be effective in time consumption, classifier performance, and in overcoming space complexity issues.  © 2022 G. Subathra et al.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud servers, storing data on cloud servers has become a popular option. However, cloud servers are centralized. Storing data on centralized cloud servers may involve some risks. For example, the data access pattern may be revealed when accessing data on cloud servers. Therefore, protecting a user’s patterns has become a crucial concern. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a candidate solution to hide the data access pattern. However, it inherently induces some overhead of accessing data, and many blockchain-based applications also do not consider the access pattern leakage issues. In this paper, we address these issues above by proposing a decentralized database system with oblivious access in a (parallel) smart contract model. The interactions of oblivious access are asymmetric where the smart contract side is expected to put much effort into computation. The proposed system slightly reduces the overhead of ORAM and overcomes the issues stemming from the centralization of servers. The main techniques are to use the garbled circuits to reduce the cost of communication and to combine with the parallel smart contract model to (conceptually) improve the performance of smart contract execution on the blockchain. © 2022 by the authors.

It is crucial that we improve our energy management due to the ever-growing imbalance in demand-supply. The new wave in the energy sector is characterized by the three D's of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. For a sustainable life, it is necessary that energy is tapped from alternative sources that are renewable to leave a minimal carbon footprint. To integrate different sources with the main power grid, we require two-way communication among them. This makes it indispensable that consumers are empowered to protect their privacy and make them the sole owners of their data. A good access control scheme would ensure security of data, and an efficient trading platform would ensure judicious use of the resources. Here, we propose a framework URJA with an access control scheme and an energy trading platform based on blockchain for a smart grid. The locally available renewable sources of energy are connected to the grid such that demand-supply is managed effectively without loss of efficiency and privacy.

	abstract = {Popular blockchains such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in the block through user-defined scripts known as smart contracts. Serial execution of smart contract transactions/atomic units (AUs) fails to harness the multiprocessing power offered by the prevalence of multi-core processors. By adding concurrency to the execution of AUs, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this paper, we develop a concurrent miner that proposes a block by executing AUs concurrently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). It efficiently captures independent AUs in the concurrent bin and dependent AUs in the block graph (BG). Later, we propose a concurrent validator that re-executes the same AUs concurrently and deterministically using the concurrent bin followed by the BG given by the miner to verify the block. We rigorously prove the correctness of concurrent execution of AUs. The performance benchmark shows that the average speedup for the optimized concurrent miner is 5.21 × , while the maximum is 14.96 × over the serial miner. The optimized validator obtains an average speedup of 8.61 × to a maximum of 14.65 × over the serial validator. The proposed miner outperforms 1.02 × to 1.18 × , while the proposed validator outperforms 1 × to 4.46 × over state-of-the-art concurrent miners and validators, respectively. Moreover, the proposed efficient BG saves an average of 2.29 × more block space when compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A large portion of today’s deep learning systems are based on centralized servers and fall short in providing operational transparency, traceability, reliability, security, and trusted data provenance features. Also, training deep learning models by utilizing centralized data is vulnerable to the single point of failure problem. In this paper, we explore the importance of integrating blockchain technology with deep learning. We review the existing literature focused on the integration of blockchain with deep learning. We classify and categorize the literature by devising a thematic taxonomy based on seven parameters; namely, blockchain type, deep learning models, deep learning specific consensus protocols, application area, services, data types, and deployment goals. We provide insightful discussions on the state-of-the-art blockchain-based deep learning frameworks by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we compare the existing blockchain-based deep learning frameworks based on four parameters such as blockchain type, consensus protocol, deep learning method, and dataset. Finally, we present important research challenges which need to be addressed to develop highly trustworthy deep learning frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are gaining popularity as a means to support transparent, traceable, and self-executing decentralized applications, which enable the exchange of value in a trustless environment. Developers of smart contracts rely on various libraries, such as OpenZeppelin for Solidity contracts, to improve application quality and reduce development costs. The API documentations of these libraries are important sources of information for developers who are unfamiliar with the APIs. Yet, maintaining high-quality documentations is non-trivial, and errors in documentations may place barriers for developers to learn the correct usages of APIs. In this paper, we propose a technique, DocCon, to detect inconsistencies between documentations and the corresponding code for Solidity smart contract libraries. Our fact-based approach allows inconsistencies of different severity levels to be queried, from a database containing precomputed facts about the API code and documentations. DocCon successfully detected high-priority API documentation errors in popular smart contract libraries, including mismatching parameters, missing requirements, outdated descriptions, etc. Our experiment result shows that DocCon achieves good precision and is applicable to different libraries: 29 and 22 out of our reported 40 errors have been confirmed and fixed by library developers so far.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can provide intelligent and effective solutions to various applications with higher accuracy that requires less or no human intervention. Smart Cities are one of the significant applications of the IoT comprising a collection of various services such as intelligent transportation, waste management, smart homes, etc. These heterogeneous services offer a wide range of collaborative applications in smart cities. A smart municipality in a smart city is a concept in which a digital municipal corporation is developed to provide comprehensive local government collaboration services based on digitization and automation aiming towards raising the living standards of citizens. Interoperability between heterogeneous services for collaborative tasks creates challenges for data security and privacy. Ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information is critical, and reliable data is essential to both the government and its citizens. In this paper, we proposed a service security architecture based on authentication and authorization for constrained environments during collaborative tasks for Software Defined Networking (SDN) and smart contract-enabled municipal smart cities. The proposed collaborative service security framework is being tested on the Multichain Blockchain networks. We present a novel method for using smart contracts in multichain blockchains for data security during collaborative tasks in smart city municipal architecture. The proposed security solution is based on the dynamism of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions securely between different heterogeneous IoT networks. We implemented a supportive use case for collaborative services in an SDN-enabled IoT architecture to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed service security architecture. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper presents DeCon, a declarative programming language for implementing smart contracts and specifying contract-level properties. Driven by the observation that smart contract operations and contract-level properties can be naturally expressed as relational constraints, DeCon models each smart contract as a set of relational tables that store transaction records. This relational representation of smart contracts enables convenient specification of contract properties, facilitates run-time monitoring of potential property violations, and brings clarity to contract debugging via data provenance. Specifically, a DeCon program consists of a set of declarative rules and violation query rules over the relational representation, describing the smart contract implementation and contract-level properties, respectively. We have developed a tool that can compile DeCon programs into executable Solidity programs, with instrumentation for run-time property monitoring. Our case studies demonstrate that DeCon can implement realistic smart contracts such as ERC20 and ERC721 digital tokens. Our evaluation results reveal the marginal overhead of DeCon compared to the open-source reference implementation, incurring 14% median gas overhead for execution, and another 16% median gas overhead for run-time verification.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {In modern society, the food supply chain management system has become an important research area realized nationally and internationally, which has established a collaborative relationship between producers, manufacturers, processors and retailers. Now, consumers are more interested in food quality, safety and the authentication of the products. Food safety has become an important issue in public health in the food market because people of all types and races around the world are affected due its poor quality. The traditional supply chains are centralized and face different issues such as lack of transparency, accountability and audit ability. The general issues in supply chain management include lack of communication, trust among the stakeholders, and interference of entities and wastage of food. A lot of work has been completed by researchers to address the above issues, but still, there is a need for effective mechanisms for the modeling of supply chain management systems. In this paper, a trusted, self-organized, traceable formal system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) is developed by using wireless sensors networks and finite automata. In the proposed model, smart contracts are designed to assure the automated payment procedures. The proposed model reduced the need for centralized authority. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to realize the requirements, and automata is used to capture behavior of the system. A blockchain-based model is used to provides the privacy and security mechanism for the transitions record. Wireless sensors are used to sense the information, and actors are used for decision making in case of any violation in the contact. A lot of work has been completed by researchers on smart contracts. Different smart contracts are designed to achieve the better traceability among producers, transporter/logistics and consumers. Our system provides the smart contract algorithm to show the interaction of entities in the food supply chain management system. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL) is used to describe the formal system and the VDM-SL toolbox is used for the validation and analysis of the system. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts. © 2022 The Author(s)},

As an example of a sharing economy application, ridesharing services take advantage of underutilized resources to create economic value. However, the unruly design of ridesharing systems may make urban traffic more congested and cause other technology-organization-environment issues. This study explores the application of blockchain and smart contract technologies to enhance ridesharing services by harvesting the blockchain benefits of transaction traceability, process transparency, system automation and disintermediation. After presenting system design and implementation details for building and deploying a blockchain-based system to support the reengineered ridesharing service with required business functions, we conduct functionality/performance tests and theory-based comparative analysis to confirm its feasibility and applicability. The results reveal that our system with blockchain-enabled benefits is superior to incumbent ridesharing systems. Moreover, while prior research rarely reports the design and implementation details of blockchain-based systems to support sharing economy services, this paper primarily contributes to extant literature by not only proposing a layered system architecture adapting blockchain and smart contracts into the desired ridesharing service but also demonstrating the design and implementation details, covering the development tools, the deployment environment and the deployed smart contracts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the current era, the skyrocketing demand for energy necessitates a powerful mechanism to mitigate the supply–demand gap in intelligent energy infrastructure, i.e., the smart grid. To handle this issue, an intelligent and secure energy management system (EMS) could benefit end-consumers participating in the Demand–Response (DR) program. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a real-time and secure incentive-based EMS for smart grid, i.e., RI-EMS approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and blockchain technology. In the RI-EMS approach, we proposed a novel reward mechanism for better convergence of the RL-based model using a Q-learning approach based on the greedy policy that guides the RL-agent for faster convergence. Then, the proposed RI-EMS approach designed a real-time incentive mechanism to minimize energy consumption in peak hours and reduce end-consumers’ energy bills to provide incentives to the end-consumers. Experimental results show that the proposed RI-EMS approach induces end-consumer participation and increases customer profitabilities compared to existing approaches considering the different performance evaluation metrics such as energy consumption for end-consumers, energy consumption reduction, and total cost comparison to end-consumers. Furthermore, blockchain-based results are simulated and analyzed with the help of deployed smart contracts in a Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the parameters such as transaction efficiency and data storage cost. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the Internet of things (IoT) has recently gained attention in developing various smart city applications such as smart healthcare, smart supply chain, smart home, smart grid, etc. The existing literature focuses on the smart healthcare system as a public emergency service (PES) to provide timely treatment to the patient. However, little attention is given to a distributed smart fire brigade system as a PES to protect human life and properties from severe fire damage. The traditional PES are developed on a centralised system, which requires high computation and does not ensure timely service fulfilment. Furthermore, these traditional PESs suffer from a lack of trust, transparency, data integrity, and a single point of failure issue. In this context, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Secure and Trusted (BEST) framework for PES in the smart city environment. The BEST framework focuses on providing a fire brigade service as a PES to the smart home based on IoT device information to protect it from serious fire damage. Further, we used two edge computing servers, an IoT controller and a service controller. The IoT and service controller are used for local storage and to enhance the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfilments, respectively. The IoT controller manages an access control list to keep track of registered IoT gateways and their IoT devices, avoiding misguiding the PES department. The service controller utilised the queue model to handle the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. Further, various smart contracts are designed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform to automatically call a PES either in the presence or absence of the smart-home owner under uncertain environmental conditions. The performance evaluation of the proposed BEST framework indicates the benefits of utilising the distributed environment and the smart contract logic. The various simulation results are evaluated in terms of service queue length, utilisation, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, number of PES departments, number of PES providers, and end-to-end delay. These simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the BEST framework. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper presents SAILFISH, a scalable system for automatically finding state-inconsistency bugs in smart contracts. To make the analysis tractable, we introduce a hybrid approach that includes (i) a light-weight exploration phase that dramatically reduces the number of instructions to analyze, and (ii) a precise refinement phase based on symbolic evaluation guided by our novel value-summary analysis, which generates extra constraints to over-approximate the side effects of whole-program execution, thereby ensuring the precision of the symbolic evaluation. We developed a prototype of SAILFISH and evaluated its ability to detect two state-inconsistency flaws, viz., reentrancy and transaction order dependence (TOD) in Ethereum smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our hybrid approach as well as the benefit of the value summary analysis. In particular, we show that SAILFISH outperforms five state-of the-art smart contract analyzers (SECURIFY, MYTHRIL, OYENTE, SEREUM and VANDAL) in terms of performance, and precision. In total, SAILFISH discovered 47 previously unknown vulnerable smart contracts out of 89,853 smart contracts from ETHERSCAN.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present a solution based on blockchain technology and smart contracts for agile project management in light of the continuing transition in the software development industry. Due to the fact that these technologies are self-executing, customized, and impervious to tampering, they are considered to be crucial for the transition to a more efficient, transparent, and transactive payment gateway between major stakeholders. These major stakeholders will be able to communicate through smart contracts, which will act as a bridge between them. As part of their responsibility, they will make sure that all of the terms of the contract are met and acknowledged by all members of the team. As a result of our research, we propose a model in which payouts could be automatically enabled and penalties or grants could be introduced based on performance. If any changes were to be made to the contract in the future, all parties involved would be automatically notified. To maintain the development cycle, they should accept these changes as soon as possible. Because of this, the product owner and client are able to concentrate their resources on more profitable and productive tasks, without the need to monitor this aspect of agile project management. Our proposed model brings together different partners with the objective of successfully developing different IT projects by leveraging software engineering solutions such as smart contracts. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {An unprecedented amount of goods and commodities are shipped and transported globally each day through different modes of transport. Due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust and secure ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in cargo processing delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. Most of today's systems and technologies leveraged for managing shipping containers in unimodal and multimodal logistics fall short of providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that allows users to trace and track their container shipments in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, auditable, secure, and trustworthy. We employ the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to overcome the limited data storage problem. We develop smart contracts and present algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details in both unimodal and multimodal logistics. We present security and cost analyses to show that the proposed solution is secure and cost-efficient. Furthermore, we compare our proposed solution with the existing solutions to show its novelty.

	abstract = {Learning heterogeneous graphs consisting of different types of nodes and edges enhances the results of homogeneous graph techniques. An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs' structures. MANDO extracts customized meta-paths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score. © 2022 IEEE.},

The cost of deploying a blockchain system in a real environment to conduct research on security issues is relatively high, and the related security analysis and verification are also destructive and irreproducible. Therefore, based on the idea of layered design, this paper proposes a blockchain system simulation platform. The blockchain system is divided into four layers in the simulation platform: the consensus layer, network layer, contract layer, and storage layer. In the consensus layer, the problem of computing resource waste is solved. In the network layer, a peer-to-peer network topology simulation is implemented. In the storage layer, the problem of redundant storage is solved. In the contract layer, the contract replay speed is accelerated. Finally, a prototype of an efficient blockchain simulation system is implemented based on the above methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The new IoT apps will not be able to inspire people to utilize them and may ultimately lose all their potential if an interoperable and trustworthy ecosystem is not provided. IoT has its extra security difficulties such as information storage, administration, privacy concerns, and authentication. The presently deployed IoT apps have encountered various security and privacy assaults globally. Due to being less secure and low powered, the IoT devices present a simple entryway to the adversaries to obtain access to the corporate networks, leading to giving easy control over all of the data of the users. The objective of this doctorate proposed work will be to solve the security associated difficulties in multiple IoT domains like the e-commerce, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), and Internet of Drones (IoD). The proposed study focuses on the development of a distributed framework for IoT based on blockchain. The framework includes the usage of Ethereum-based smart contracts and auction models to increase the income and QoS for both the seller and the buyer and the development of a DAG chain-based distributed framework for parking lot allocation in a network of automobiles. The suggested model includes the requirement of obtaining agreement among the nodes with probability one in such a circumstance. The suggested model demonstrates to be predictable as typical voting-based consensus protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and at the same time can accommodate a high number of nodes even in an asynchronous setting. Research on Byzantine fault-tolerant systems has been ongoing for more than four decades, and although the solutions were shown to be feasible early on, they remained unworkable for a long time. With PBFT, the first feasible solution was provided in 1999, and this sparked fresh research that has resulted in unique applications that are still being developed today employing this technology. Despite the fact that the safety and liveness properties of PBFT-type protocols have been thoroughly investigated, when it comes to practical performance, only empirical results - often obtained in artificial environments - are known, and imperfections in the communication channels are not explicitly considered. It is our goal in this paper to propose the first performance model for PBFT that takes into account the effect of unreliable channels as well as the usage of alternative transport protocols across those channels. We also performed a large number of simulations to test the model and acquire a better understanding of the influence of different deployment factors on the total transaction timeframe.  © 2022 D.

	abstract = {Over time, distribution systems have begun to include increased distributed energy resources (DERs) due to the advancement of auxiliary power electronics, information and communication technologies (ICT), and cost reductions. Electric vehicles (EVs) will undoubtedly join the energy community alongside DERs, and energy transfers from vehicles to grids and vice versa will become more extensive in the future. Virtual power plants (VPPs) will also play a key role in integrating these systems and participating in wholesale markets. Energy trading on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis is a promising business model for transactive energy that aids in balancing local supply and demand. Moreover, a market scheme between VPPs can help DER owners make more profit while reducing renewable energy waste. For this purpose, an inter-VPP P2P trading scheme is proposed. The scheme utilizes cutting-edge technologies of the Avalanche blockchain platform, developed from scratch with decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications (DApps), and Web3 workflows in mind. Avalanche is more scalable and has faster transaction finality than its layer-1 predecessors. It provides interoperability abilities among other common blockchain networks, facilitating inter-VPP P2P trading between different blockchain-based VPPs. The merits of DeFi contribute significantly to the workflow in this type of energy trading scenario, as the price mechanism can be determined using open market-like instruments. A detailed case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and flow, and important conclusions were drawn. © 2022 by the authors.},

Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions are getting integrated to numerous services, making them 'smarter.' However, the data remain fragmented in individual organizational silos inhibiting data value extraction to its full potential. Digital marketplaces are emerging to allow data owners to monetize these data. Yet concerns, such as privacy, security, and unfair payment settlement deter adoption of such platforms. In addition, the state-of-the-art platforms are under the control of large multinational corporations with no transparency between the buyer and seller in terms of payment details, listing, data discovery, and storage. In this work, a novel decentralized platform of a digital data marketplace for IoT data has been proposed. The platform leverages a decentralized data streaming network to host IoT data in a reliable and fault-tolerant manner. The platform ensures fair trading, data storage, and delivery in a privacy-preserving manner and trust metric calculation for actors in the network. In order to study the feasibility of the proposed platform, an opensource library is developed using Hyperledger Fabric and data network layer built on VerneMQ, the library is deployed on a real-time Google cloud platform. The library is tested and results are analyzed for throughput, overheads, and scalability.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The vast enhancement in the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is due to the impact of the distributed emerging technology and topology of the industrial IoV. It has created a new paradigm, such as the security-related resource constraints of Industry 5.0. A new revolution and dimension in the IoV popup raise various critical challenges in the existing information preservation, especially in node transactions and communication, transmission, trust and privacy, and security-protection-related problems, which have been analyzed. These aspects pose serious problems for the industry to provide vehicular-related data integrity, availability, information exchange reliability, provenance, and trustworthiness for the overall activities and service delivery prospects against the increasing number of multiple transactions. In addition, there has been a lot of research interest that intersects with blockchain and Internet of Vehicles association. In this regard, the inadequate performance of the Internet of Vehicles and connected nodes and the high resource requirements of the consortium blockchain ledger have not yet been tackled with a complete solution. The introduction of the NuCypher Re-encryption infrastructure, hashing tree and allocation, and blockchain proof-of-work require more computational power as well. This paper contributes in two different folds. First, it proposes a blockchain sawtooth-enabled modular architecture for protected, secure, and trusted execution, service delivery, and acknowledgment with immutable ledger storage and security and peer-to-peer (P2P) network on-chain and off-chain inter-communication for vehicular activities. Secondly, we design and create a smart contract-enabled data structure in order to provide smooth industrial node streamlined transactions and broadcast content. Substantially, we develop and deploy a hyperledger sawtooth-aware customized consensus for multiple proof-of-work investigations. For validation purposes, we simulate the exchange of information and related details between connected devices on the IoV. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture of BIoV reduces the cost of computational power down to 37.21% and the robust node generation and exchange up to 56.33%. Therefore, only 41.93% and 47.31% of the Internet of Vehicles-related resources and network constraints are kept and used, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

Based on the above status quo, a blockchain-based secure e-commerce system is researched and implemented. Using the distributed architecture of the blockchain system and the automatic execution feature of smart contracts, a secure transaction application system is designed to realize decentralization and solve the problem of untrustworthy intermediate parties. Data storage is based on the mechanism of combining blockchain and offchain databases to ensure data security, and the characteristic of blockchain can only be appended and read to prevent the system from being tampered. The database index and the storage structure of smart contract commodity information and transaction information are established to improve the query efficiency. The functional and performance tests of the system show that the transaction processing efficiency is high in the multinode environment, and the response time of order and commodity status query can reach 80 ms. The design and development process of the system is introduced in detail, which is an important reference value for the application of blockchain technology in e-commerce. © 2022 Yishuang Cheng and Juan Pan.},

In response to the above problems, this paper designs a protocol for post-quantum privacy-preserving PDP and uses it to develop a scheme based on smart contracts. The proposed scheme has the characteristics of being post quantum and can satisfy the demand for public verification while preserving user privacy. The property of noninteraction of the protocol can reduce transaction fees incurred owing to the frequent operation of the blockchain, and the smart contract with a deposit mechanism can ensure fair payments to all parties. The results of a theoretical analysis and experiments show that the proposed scheme is highly secure and efficient.  © 2023 Zhengwen Li et al.},

	abstract = {Globalisation has facilitated different industries to eliminate geographical boundaries and equipped organisations to work collectively to produce goods. Pharmaceuticals is one such industry which has majorly benefited from globalisation to reduce costs and increase profitability at different aspects of research, development, manufacturing of drugs and finally distribution of drugs. Globalisation not only reduces costs and increases profits for the industry, it also makes essential medication available to all individuals even at remote areas of undeveloped, developing and developed countries. As the number of entities or participants grew in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), the complexity and abstractness of the drug delivery from manufacturer to consumer has increased, which raised new concerns like counterfeit medication, incorrect, incomplete or no information about the drug reaching the consumer thus undermining customer confidence and most importantly distribution delays which can cause serious impact on the life of the consumer as well as business growth. Considering all these challenges, there is a dire need for a robust PSC which can eliminate blind parties and provide a transparent chain. A transparent PSC will eliminate data fragmentation between different participating entities by creating a trail of secure, single source of truth for the entire life cycle of a medicine, thereby eliminating the introduction of counterfeits and ensuring the consumer safety. This article proposes a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent supply chain for PSC and proof-of-concept is implemented to analyse the scalability and efficiency of the proposed architecture. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of the technologies which can provide such transparent PSC and Smart Contracts (SC) are the most commonly used component in such systems to implement business logic and access control mechanisms. The proposed PharmaChain model investigates all the interactions between the main entities in PSC and also addresses smart contract issues such as re-entrance, randomness and lacking trustworthy data feed. Results are compared with other proposed solutions for PSC based on DLT. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Food supply chains are highly distributed, collaborative, heterogeneous, diverse, and varied by product, process, and destination. The global food supply chain (FSC) objective is to maintain a good balance between supply and demand and move products from producer to market. However, sustainability of the FSC has become a major concern as limited resources and increasing population pressure threaten its existence. Supply chain management is an important issue for FSC due to information flow throughout the supply chain. Industry-specific characteristics and extensive integration among multiple actors in an entire supply chain exacerbate this situation. The agri-food sector has one of the lowest rates of information technology penetration for innovation. Over the past thirty years, information and communication technology (ICT) has been introduced into the agricultural and food sectors, helping to improve food production and transportation. However, there are various challenges, such as transparency, accountability, food scandal, trust, and inefficient information flow, that the food supply chain is still facing in reaching sustainable goals. The complexity of food supply systems and the opportunities and challenges faced regarding desired sustainability performance need to be examined to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Blockchain is an emerging and disruptive digital technology that can transform governance and sustainability in integrated food supply chains. It provides a transparent, immutable, and traceable ledger that minimizes anomalies and information fraud, making it a potential solution for designing a transparent, traceable food system. Blockchain can potentially improve the sustainability of the food supply chain by providing a transparent traceability system. Food traceability is important for managing the food supply chain and protecting public health. It allows quick and accurate traceability of contaminated food that causes foodborne illness outbreaks, leading to the withdrawal of contaminated food from markets. Blockchain can achieve traceability, provenance tracking, transparency, and reduce environmental impact in the food supply chain. It also helps in achieving sustainable development goals set by the UN. However, there is no scientific research on blockchain’s contribution to achieving these goals in the food supply chain. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review and thematic analysis to study the relationship between FSC sustainability, blockchain, and sustainable development goals. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the rapid enhancement in the design and development of the Internet of Things creates a new research interest in the adaptation in industrial domains. It is due to the impact of distributed emerging technology and topology of industrial Internet of Things and the security-related resource constraints of industrial 5.0. This conducts new paradigm along with critical challenges to the existing information preservation, node transactions and communication, transmission, trust and privacy, and security protection related problems. These critical aspects pose serious limitations and issues for the industry to provide industrial data integrity, information exchange reliability, provenance, and trustworthiness for the overall activities and service delivery prospects. In addition, the intersection of blockchain and industrial IoT has gained more consideration and research interest. However, there is an emerging limitation between the inadequate performance of industrial IoT and connected nodes, and the high resource requirement of permissioned private blockchain ledger has not yet been tackled with the complete solution. Due to the introductions of NuCypher Re-Encryption infrastructure, hashing tree and allocation, and deployment of blockchain proof-of-work required more computational power as well. This paper is divided into three different folds; first, we studied various related literature of blockchain-enabling industrial Internet of Things and its critical implementation challenging aspects along with the solution. Secondly, we proposed a blockchain hyperledger sawtooth-enabled framework. This framework provides a secure and trusted execution environment, in which service delivery mechanisms and protocols are designed with an acknowledgment, including the immutable ledger storage security, along with the peer-to-peer network on-chain and off-chain communication of industrial activities. Thirdly, we design pseudo-chain codes and consensus protocols to provide smooth industrial node streamline transactions and broadcast content. The proposed multiple proof-of-work investigated and simulated using Hyperledger Sawtooth-enabled docker for testing to exchange information between connected devices of industrial Internet of Things within the limited usage of resource constraints.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In this work, we present a distributed application developed using blockchain technologies that allows individuals and health insurance organizations to come into agreement during the implementation of the healthcare insurance policies in each contract. For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain. The application of well-established techniques for potential malfunctions of external services could also boost the security of the system and prevent it from potential attacks. © 2021 The Authors},

It is therefore important to implement approaches that can prevent rapidly emerging cyber-attacks. Essentially, the adoption of cyber security measures in healthcare should be oriented towards a better assurance of patient rights and consent management. Blockchain is one of the most advanced technologies that can deal with many types of cyber threats ensuring the integrity, availability, and privacy of the data. It adds elements of trust and traceability to the data exchange processes deployed within Hospital information systems and beyond.

	abstract = {Smart contracts are usually financial-related, which makes them attractive attack targets. Many static analysis tools have been developed to facilitate the contract audit process, but not all of them take account of two special features of smart contracts: (1) The external variables, like time, are constrained by real-world factors; (2) The internal variables persist between executions. Since these features import implicit constraints into contracts, they significantly affect the performance of static tools, such as causing errors in reachability analysis and resulting in false positives. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on implicit constraints from three aspects. First, we summarize the implicit constraints in smart contracts. Second, we evaluate the impact of such constraints on the state-of-the-art static tools. Third, we propose a lightweight but effective mitigation method named ConSym to deal with such constraints and integrate it into OSIRIS. The evaluation result shows that ConSym can filter out 96% of false positives and reduce false negatives by two-thirds.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The existing financial regulation methods cannot meet the needs of the development of FinTech, therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the trust mechanism. Blockchain can effectively solve the problems of security and trust in FinTech. This paper will explore the expression method of trust index in blockchain, and build based on blockchain a multi-dimensional trust index system and evaluation mechanism (MDTEM) for FinTech. Firstly, a four-level blockchain structure has been built, including cloud level blockchain, Internet level blockchain, contract level blockchain and application level blockchain in the FinTech ecological environment to ensure the security, reliability and trustworthiness of financial services. Secondly, according to the trust structure of blockchain on FinTech payment behavior, the index system and evaluation mechanism of direct trust, indirect trust, recommendation trust and feedback trust of FinTech based on blockchain are designed. Finally, the trust simulation experiment of FinTech mechanism is carried out from three aspects: data sending, data transmission, data reception and delivery success rate. Simulation results show that the proposed MDTEM trust mechanism can better improve the safe and reliable application of FinTech trust mechanism.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The interoperability of the entire healthcare ecosystem is a constant challenge, and even more, with all the risks posed to the security of healthcare information. Blockchain technology is emerging as one of the main alternatives when it comes to finding a balance in the healthcare ecosystem. However, the constant development of new Blockchain technologies and the evolution of healthcare systems make it difficult to find established proposals. From an architectural point of view, the design of blockchain-based solutions requires trade-offs e.g., security and interoperability. This paper focuses on two main objectives, in the first one, it was carried out a Systematic Literature Review for exploring architectural mechanisms used to support the interoperability and security of Blockchain-based Health Management Systems. Taking into account of results, a series of scenarios were generated where these mechanisms can be used along with their context, issues, and various architectural concerns (interoperability and security).

	abstract = {Purpose: The recent development in logistics due to the dawn of Logistics 4.0 has made global logistics providers more dependent on intelligent technologies. In this era, these technologies assist in data collection and transmission of logistical data and pose many security and privacy threats in logistics management systems. The customer’s private information, which is shared among the logistics stakeholders for optimal operation, faces unauthorized access due to a lack of privacy. This, amongst others, is a critical problem that needs to be addressed with blockchain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is transforming different sectors, and it has the potential to provide a solution to the issues mentioned above, with its unique features such as immutability, transparency, and anonymity. Method: This study designed a blockchain-based logistics management architecture on a decentralized peer-2-peer network using Ethereum smart contracts. The proposed system deployed the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) asymmetric encryption method to protect the logistics system from cyber-attacks and secure customers’ private information from unauthorized access. Findings: Furthermore, the security and privacy of the proposed system are evaluated based on the theorem. The proof shows that the system can provide security to the logistics system and privacy to customers’ private data. The performance evaluation is based on throughput and latency. It shows that the proposed system is better than the baseline system, and the comparatives analysis shows that the proposed system is more secure and efficient than the existing systems. Implication and Limitation: The proposed system offers a better solution to the security/privacy of the logistics management system and provides recommendations to key stakeholders involved in the logistics industry while adopting blockchain technology. Apart from the study’s methodological limitation, it is also limited by a lack of reference materials. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the business barriers that influence cost of implementing unmanned aerial system (UAS) and its suitability for a decentralised system. UAS, or drone, plays a role of data provider to architectural, engineering and construction professionals within a decentralised system. However, the expectations in the execution and test of the effectiveness of the UAS is often not met. The reasons for these fails are not well elaborated in the literature. Hence, the study investigates the barriers and cost analysis of UAS that can be used for a decentralised case, in which the UAS data are useful for multiple stakeholders, and provide illustration of the interactions within this approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is part of a longitudinal project by using a qualitative method of interviewing 24 participants involved in the process of application of drones in the country of the Dominican Republic. The open-ended semi-structured interviews were composed for questions regarding the application of UAS, barriers and business implications. The data gathered were transcribed and used thematic analysis for its interpretation. Later, conclusions of the barriers of UAS implementation in the organisation were analysed and a cost model was developed to identify a viable scenario. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the barriers and economic considerations faced in the implementation process of UAS. In this research, 16 barriers in the implementation process at the management level, 8 types of cases of business relationships and 13 business models were identified. Furthermore, recommendations were made about being the accountability of the dimensions and recurrent visits to the projects handled by the portfolio of the organisations. Research limitations/implications: Blockchain system is supported by UAS data and its tests require skills and resources that were outside of the scope of the main research intend regarding UAS implementation in construction. Furthermore, as these technologies are still under development, the assessment of the decentralised system, smart contract and swarm technology was addressed conceptually and further research are encouraged in this field. Practical implications: The paper includes barriers to consider before implementation, business implications, project examples and cost structure developed. Furthermore, the findings are fit theoretically into the context of a decentralised system. It was understood and contemplated that monitoring in open and outdoor spaces is the suitable approach for UAS implementations for decentralised system. The trend of decentralised autonomous organisations for transparency and efficiency of human tasks provides the foundations of human–robot interactions as well as the role of tokenisation of assets into the cyberspace. Therefore, the paper brings managers and technicians the implications for the future-proofing the implementation of UAS. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of the implications of cost and the suitable scenarios for return of investment in the UAS implementation in the current stage of the technology development. In addition, the paper makes reference to decentralised systems, smart contracts and swarm technology as options in which reality capture technologies are essential for construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Anonymous service delivery has attracted the interest of research and the industry for many decades. To obtain effective solutions, anonymity should be guaranteed against the service provider itself. However, if the full anonymity of users is implemented, no accountability mechanism can be provided. This represents a problem, especially when referring to scenarios in which a user, protected by anonymity, may perform illegally when leveraging the anonymous service. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution to the trade-off between anonymity and accountability. In particular, our solution relies on three independent parties (one of which is the service provider itself) such that only the collaboration of all three actors allows for the disclosure of the real identity of the user. In all other cases, anonymity is guaranteed. To show the feasibility of the proposal, we developed a prototype with user-friendly interfaces that minimize the client-side operations. Our solution is then also effective from the point of view of usability. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We implement extraction of Coq programs to functional languages based on MetaCoq's certified erasure. We extend the MetaCoq erasure output language with typing information and use it as an intermediate representation, which we call. We complement the extraction functionality with a full pipeline that includes several standard transformations (e.g. eta-expansion and inlining) implemented in a proof-generating manner along with a verified optimisation pass removing unused arguments. We prove the pass correct wrt. a conventional call-by-value operational semantics of functional languages. From the optimised representation, we obtain code in two functional smart contract languages, Liquidity and CameLIGO, the functional language Elm, and a subset of the multi-paradigm language for systems programming Rust. Rust is currently gaining popularity as a language for smart contracts, and we demonstrate how our extraction can be used to extract smart contract code for the Concordium network. The development is done in the context of the ConCert framework that enables smart contract verification. We contribute with two verified real-world smart contracts (boardroom voting and escrow), which we use, among other examples, to exemplify the applicability of the pipeline. In addition, we develop a verified web application and extract it to fully functional Elm code. In total, this gives us a way to write dependently typed programs in Coq, verify, and then extract them to several target languages while retaining a small trusted computing base of only MetaCoq and the pretty-printers into these languages.  © },

	abstract = {In this study, we propose an Information-Centric Network (ICN) approach for the Internet as an alternative to the present host-centric architecture. The proposed approach solves present Internet challenges, where most Internet users nowadays are involved in seeking knowledge by searching through large amounts of data, independent of the data's physical locations and these users usually have requests that need prompt responses. Hence, Internet requirements have got a new shape and the whole Internet paradigm should be shifting where different network considerations are needed. In this context, ICNs can play a vital role where the host-centered architecture is replaced by a content-centered one since the content itself is the aim and not the location. However, the ICN paradigm as a substitute for traditional Internet faces some challenges in terms of security and performance. ICN needs to be protected against some threats such as Denial-of-Service attacks (DoS), hacker attacks, loss of data, data replication, and cache pollution. To accomplish this, we propose this Secured Blockchain-Based ICN (SBBICN) implementation that exploits the secure aspects of Blockchain technology such as data integrity and non-tampering to secure the ICN against the aforementioned threats. In this proposed system, we describe and develop a voting system based on a blockchain consensus algorithm to avoid a single point of failure during the verification process and we apply the system using an Ethereum smart contract to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental results and the security analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the SBBICN proposal when compared to other schemes in the literature © 2022.

	abstract = {In this work we develop a rewarding framework that can be used to enhance existing crowd-sensing applications. Although a core requirement of such systems is user engagement, people may be reluctant to participate because sensitive information about them may be leaked or inferred from submitted data. The use of monetary rewards can help incentivize participation, thereby increasing not only the amount but also the quality of sensed data. Our framework allows users to submit data and obtain Bitcoin payments in a privacy-preserving manner, preventing curious providers from linking the data or the payments back to the user. At the same time, it prevents malicious user behavior such as double-redeeming attempts, where a user tries to obtain rewards for multiple submissions of the same data. More importantly, it ensures the fairness of the exchange in a completely trustless manner; by relying on the Blockchain, the trust placed on third parties in traditional fair exchange protocols is eliminated. Finally, our system is highly efficient as most of the protocol steps do not utilize the Blockchain network. When they do, only the simplest of Blockchain transactions are used as opposed to prior works that are based on the use of more complex smart contracts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the existing Blockchain-based rating/review systems address resistance to the standard attacks, i.e. collusion attack, user threatening, and unfair rating. Still, they do not present security analyses of smart contracts that may result in substantial threats to the users of the systems. This manuscript presents an in-depth study of twelve publicly available security analysis tools and standard vulnerabilities in smart contracts and reviews. The experimental setup uses a two-step approach for selecting the security analysis tool. The first step identifies the seven tools their proposers or independent researchers have compared, and the second step proposes a new method for selecting tools based on continuous improvement. Our experimental results show security issues in 51.72% of the analysed smart contracts of four Blockchain-based rating/review systems. 6.67% of vulnerable smart contracts exhibit high-level severity threats that raise an alarming condition for the current state of system developments. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Because of the rise of cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps, blockchain technology has generated a lot of interest. Among these is the emergent blockchain-based crowdsourcing paradigm, which eliminates the centralized conventional mechanism servers in favor of smart contracts for task and reward allocation. However, there are a few crucial challenges that must be resolved properly. For starters, most reputation-based systems favor high-performing employees. Secondly, the crowdsourcing platform’s expensive service charges may obstruct the growth of crowdsourcing. Finally, unequal evaluation and reward allocation might lead to job dissatisfaction. As a result, the aforementioned issues will substantially impede the development of blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems. In this study, we introduce ExCrowd, a blockchain-based crowdsourcing system that employs a smart contract as a trustworthy authority to properly select workers, assess inputs, and award incentives while maintaining user privacy. Exploration-based crowdsourcing employs the hyperbolic learning curve model based on the conduct of workers and analyzes worker performance patterns using a decision tree technique. We specifically present the architecture of our framework, on which we establish a concrete scheme. Using a real-world dataset, we implement our model on the Ethereum public test network leveraging its reliability, adaptability, scalability, and rich statefulness. The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficiency, usefulness, and adaptability of our proposed system. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular, and smart contracts (i.e., programs that run on top of the blockchain) represent a crucial element of this technology. In particular, smart contracts running on Ethereum (i.e., one of the most popular blockchain platforms) are often developed with Solidity, and their deployment and execution consume gas (i.e., a fee compensating the computing resources required). Smart contract development frequently involves code reuse, but poor readable smart contracts could hinder their reuse. However, writing readable smart contracts is challenging, since practices for improving the readability could also be in contrast with optimization strategies for reducing gas consumption. This paper aims at better understanding (i) the readability aspects for which traditional software and smart contracts differ, and (ii) the specific smart contract readability features exhibiting significant relationships with gas consumption. We leverage a set of metrics that previous research has proven correlated with code readability. In particular, we first compare the values of these metrics obtained for both Solidity smart contracts and traditional software systems (written in Java). Then, we investigate the correlations occurring between these metrics and gas consumption and between each pair of metrics. The results of our study highlight that smart contracts usually exhibit lower readability than traditional software for what concerns the number of parentheses, inline comments, and blank lines used. In addition, we found some readability metrics (such as the average length of identifiers and the average number of keywords) that significantly correlate with gas consumption.  © 2022 ACM.},

One of the related research areas generating increasing interest is the field of education, with particular focus on the digitization and automation of educational management processes and the ability to store and verify digital documents about student progress. The main goal of this study is to develop a platform that creates a unified digital register of students’ educational achievements, which is one of the most pressing issues in the field of education, based on the Ethereum blockchain architecture. Blockchain is expensive; therefore, there is a need to consider performance criteria when evaluating any decision made about the technology, especially the most important aspects such as predicting traffic behavior, estimating transaction costs and providing the necessary indicators of system quality and functionality. However, most research ignores the evaluation of performance indicators, such as throughput, the speed of transactions and the amount of data stored in the Ethereum blockchain database, which are the main evaluation criteria. This paper aims to eliminate this gap by evaluating the performance of the developed platform and by discussing the obtained experimental results. Thus, the main results of this work are the design and deployment of a blockchain platform and the analysis of its transaction costs. We conclude that the proposed blockchain solution is applicable as a system for the accounting and verification of loans and student academic achievements. © 2022 by the authors.},

The emerging Industry 4.0 has introduced promising potential technologies that have expedited the transition of Internet of Things (IoT) into the Internet of Everything (IoE), utilizing the advances in artificial intelligence. Such a transition implies that sensitive data can be effortlessly accessed via the open network used by various domains such as military, business, transportation, medical, and education, leading to potential security concerns. Although a blockchain, along with the above fields, already employs a fast network such as 5G, the explosive growth in the development and implementation of various Industry 4.0-related domains requires significantly faster networking speeds and a secure mechanism for data transfer. This exhibits the need for 6G to meet the requirements of real-time applications, as shown in the graphical representation of the abstract.

Research has revealed that a significant number of smart contracts are subject to programming flaws, making them vulnerable to attacks and leading to detrimental effects, such as asset loss. Researchers and developers call for a thorough analysis of challenges to identify their causes and propose solutions. To respond to these calls, we conducted two literature reviews and diverse expert interviews and synthesized scattered knowledge on challenges and solutions. We identified 29 challenges (e.g., code visibility, code updateability, and encapsulation) and 60 solutions (e.g., gas limit specification, off-ledger computations, and shadowing). Moreover, we developed 20 software design patterns (SDPs) in collaboration with smart contract developers. The SDPs help developers adjust their programming habits and thus support them in their daily development practices. Our results provide actionable knowledge for smart contract developers to overcome the identified challenges and offer support for comparing smart contract integration concepts across three fundamentally different DLT protocols (i.e., Ethereum, EOSIO, and Hyperledger Fabric). Moreover, we support developers in becoming aware of peculiarities in smart contract development and the resulting benefits and drawbacks.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is another development of blockchain technology after Ethereum, which is more suitable as an operating platform for smart contracts. However, the testing technology of Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts (also known as chaincode) is not yet mature currently. Based on this, this paper studies the vulnerability detection of Golang chaincodes. Firstly, we summarize 17 kinds of Golang chaincode vulnerabilities by investigating existing research. Secondly, taking the high accuracy of dynamic detection and the high efficiency of static detection into consideration, we propose a chaincode vulnerability detection framework that combines the dynamic symbolic execution and the static abstract syntax tree analysis technology. We also implement a supporting-tool that can detect the above 15 types of vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the tool by 15 chaincodes collected from GitHub and unknown vulnerabilities were detected in 13 projects. The precision turned out to be 91% after manual inspection. In order to verify the recall rate, we manually inject 30 vulnerabilities into the collected chaincodes and all of them are detected. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the proposed vulnerability detection method for Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The advance of information technology has a growing influence on one of the most popular social trends: online shopping. The rising popularity of online shopping among the general public, as indicated by the growth in the number of online purchasers each year, has prompted business owners to pursue online ventures. The marketplace is intrinsically tied to online buying activity that connects merchants and customers, allowing customers to search for various goods and services from various providers. However, service failures are vulnerable to centralized market systems that emerge frequently. When the company's services to customers fail to satisfy consumer expectations. A breakdown in purchasing and selling essential services, including product delivery and customer support, is referred to as service failure. As a result, not only does this harm confidence, but it may also cause clients to migrate to an alternative marketplace. The marketplace's competitiveness is based on consumer confidence. The decentralized marketplace can address this security concern. A decentralized marketplace is meant to build a system that does not require the confidence of a third party using blockchain technology and smart contracts that can record all transactions clearly and consistently, allowing them to serve as a single point of truth between distrusting entities. The findings largely support the feasibility of Ethereum Smart Contracts to construct a decentralized marketplace. However, there are some places where further study and development are needed. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most countries in the world are currently faced with a series of public procurement challenges. Moreover, the large volumes of public procurement and the impact it may have of the global economy, the environment and the society at large justify a research study aimed at achieving sustainable and smart procurement. Smart public procurement intensively relies on emerging technologies and it is both an international priority and a challenge to achieve it. This paper is aimed at addressing such procurement-specific challenges. This study reflects the current status and the trends in public procurement, as well as the manner in which Blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIoT) may lead to a beneficial change in the field. In order to analyse the impact of BIoT, we are putting forward an assessment model comprising the definition and the description of six hypotheses. They are validated both by reference to the current knowledge status and via the analysis of the data collected in a survey which was conducted in Romania. It was aimed at collecting and analysing the data from the main stakeholders as well as at formulating recommendations/actions related to the modernisation of the current system. The study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the proposed model and to establish the relationships between the adoption of BIoT and smart, sustainable and transparent public procurement. At the same time, we analyse the links between the adoption of BIoT and aspects such as corruption and fraud, the challenges related to technological integration and the need to reengineer organisations, as well as national and international policies. Following our analyses, there emerged that BIoT adoption has a positive impact on the achievement of sustainable public procurement processes (the highest effect), on transparency and the trust in public procurement, on reducing corruption and fraud in public procurement and on the achievement of smart public procurement. The paper provides theoretical and practical contributions that should support solutions to the current major challenges and represent a vehicle for innovation and sustainable development alike.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ever-growing smart applications will expand the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem to connect over 75 billion devices by 2025. IoT ecosystems comprise sensors that act as data suppliers and applications where monetary transactions are required to compensate the data producers. This signifies the importance of IoT payments and marketplaces to facilitate micro-transactions of billions of connected devices in the IoT ecosystem, which is heterogeneous, decentralized, and diverse. However, realizing such an ecosystem raises multiple challenges such as overcoming poor inter-operability, resource constraints, and security and privacy vulnerabilities of IoT devices and platforms. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that can be identified as a potential solution to overcome the challenges in realizing IoT payments and marketplaces. This is due to the characteristics of blockchain such as decentralization, traceability, immutability, and non-repudiation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on blockchain-based IoT payments and marketplaces. This paper provides a brief introduction to the concepts of IoT payments and IoT marketplaces. Then the technical challenges involved in realizing IoT payment and marketplaces are discussed by highlighting the blockchain-based solutions. Furthermore, blockchain-based smart applications which use IoT marketplace and IoT payment concepts are presented marking the role of blockchain in each of the application. Subsequently, the paper discuss the integration challenges while also highlighting possible solutions. It is envisaged that this paper would shed light on the development of blockchain-based solutions to realize IoT payments and marketplaces.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is a growing demand for transparency along the agri-food chain, both from customers and governments. The adoption of blockchain technology to enable secure traceability for the management of the agri-food chain, provide information such as the provenance of a food product and prevent food fraud, is emerging rapidly, due to the inherent trust and inalterability provided by this technology. However, developing the right smart contracts for these use cases is even more of a challenge than it is for those used in other fields. Several management systems for the agri-food chain based on blockchain technology and smart contract have been proposed, all however ad-hoc for a specific product or production process and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a new approach to easily customize and compose general Ethereum-based smart contracts designed for the agri-food industrial domain, to be able to reuse the code and modules and automate the process to shorten development times, while keeping it safe and reliable. Starting from the definition of the real production process, we aim to automatically generate both the smart contracts to manage the system and the user interfaces to interact with them, thus producing a system that works semi-automatically. Additionally, we describe a honey production case study to show how our approach works. Future work will first extend the scope of the approach to other supply chains, furthermore, while the current platform used is Ethereum, in the future our approach will be easily extended to other blockchain platforms.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As of 2022, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, the smart contract powered tokens that represent ownership in a specific digital asset, have become a popular investment vehicle. In 2021, NFT trading reached USD 17.6 billion and entered mainstream media with several celebrities and major companies launching tokens within the space. The rapid rise in popularity of NFTs has brought with it a number of risks and concerns, two of which will be discussed and addressed in this technical paper. Data storage of the underlying digital asset connected to an NFT is held off-chain in most cases and is therefore out of the NFT holders’ control. This issue will be discussed and addressed using a theoretical workflow developed and presented for a system that converges NFTs and verifiable credentials with the aim of storing underlying NFT digital assets in a decentralized manner. The second issue focuses on the rise of NFT infringements and fraud within the overall NFT space. This will be discussed and addressed through the development of a practical application, named “Connect2NFT”. The main functionality of this practical application will enable users to connect their Twitter social media accounts to the NFTs they own, thus ensuring that potential buyers or viewers of the NFT can comprehensively conclude who is the authentic owner of a specific NFT. An individual performance analysis of the proposed solution will be conducted in addition to being compared and evaluated against similar applications. Thorough development, implementation, and testing has been performed in order to establish a practical solution that can be tested and applied to current NFT use cases. The theoretical NFT storage solution is a minor but equally important contribution in comparison. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient tokenization is a novel approach that allows anonymous patient-level linkage across healthcare facilities, minimizing the risk of breaching protected health information in health information exchange (HIE). Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods: We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results: A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions: This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The days of storing data manually are behind us. We are opting for the online form of data storage and transfer. The new era of data digitization comes with its own perks and detriments. Cybersecurity is still a crucial concern today. As more data transfer occurs through an online medium, the risks of a breach and cyberattacks are inevitable. The whole foundation of e-commerce is based on the online transfer of goods and transactions without the need to travel. Transferring transactional data and transactions in e-commerce are prone to cyber threats. Our research's major objective is to develop a system that protects against such mishaps, especially during the transfer of transactional data, and also implement an automated system that ensures these transactions occur without any errors. To implement this, we are taking advantage of new emerging technologies called blockchain and smart contract. Blockchain allows a decentralized, immutable digital ledger to safely store and transfer data across the network. Blockchain technology is used in e-commerce to transfer transactions in a safe, secure, and faster way. Blockchain enables a peer-to-peer transaction system and data encryption that enables the safe transfer of transactional data. Blockchain is used to transfer transactional data. A smart contract is a special program that enables, verifies, and enforces the terms of a contract digitally. It provides transactional security as the contact is in place. The blockchain, coupled with smart contracts, will revolutionize the future of e-commerce. We have combined blockchain technology to ensure data security and user privacy with smart contracts to ensure that the protocol for the transaction is maintained. The results are presented by building and implementing the proposed system that provides the solution for transactional data privacy.  © 2022 Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan et al.},

	abstract = {Current traditional shipping models are increasingly revealing many shortcomings and affecting the interests of sellers and buyers due to having to depend on trusted third parties. For example, the Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) model must depend on the carrier/shipper, or the Letter-of-Credit (LoC) model depends on the place of the Letter certification (i.e., bank). There have been many examples demonstrating the riskiness of the two models above. Specifically, in developing countries (e.g., Vietnam), the demand for exporting goods and trading between sellers and buyers have not yet applied the benefits of current technology to improve traditional shipping models. Two typical examples in the last five years that have demonstrated the risks of both sellers and buyers when applying CoD and LoC models are the problem of keeping the money of the seller of GNN Expresses (2017) as well as risks in losing control of 4 containers of cashew nuts when exporting from Vietnam to Italy (2021). A series of studies have proposed solutions based on distributed storage, blockchain, and smart contracts to solve the above problems. However, the role of the shipper has not been considered in some approaches or is not suitable for deployment in a developed country (i.e., Vietnam). In this paper, we propose a combination model between the traditional CoD model and blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFT to solve the above problems. Specifically, our contribution includes four aspects: a) proposing a shipping model based on blockchain technology and smart contracts; b) proposing a model for storing package information based on Ethereum’s NFT technology (i.e. ERC721); c) implementing the proposed model by designing smart contracts that support the creation and transfer of NFTs between sellers and buyers; d) deploy smart contracts on four EVM-enabled platforms including BNB Smart chain, Fantom, Celo, and Polygon to find a suitable platform for the proposed model. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

As a radical decentralized data management technology, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to support a trustworthy digital infrastructure facilitating the DNO-DSO transition. Based on a comprehensive review of worldwide research and practice, as well as the engagement of relevant industrial experts, the application of DLT in distribution networks is identified and analyzed in this article. The DLT features and DSO needs are first summarized, and the mapping relationship between them is identified. Detailed DSO functions are identified and classified into five categories (i.e., 'planning,' 'operation,' 'market,' 'asset,' and 'connection') with the potential of applying DLT to various DSO functions assessed. Finally, the development of seven key DSO functions with high DLT potential is analyzed and discussed from the technical, legal, and social perspectives, including peer-to-peer energy trading, flexibility market facilitation, electric vehicle charging, network pricing, distributed generation register, data access, and investment planning.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Programming errors enable security attacks on smart contracts, which are used to manage large sums of financial assets. Automated program repair (APR) techniques aim to reduce developers' burden of manually fixing bugs by automatically generating patches for a given issue. Existing APR tools for smart contracts focus on mitigating typical smart contract vulnerabilities rather than violations of functional specification. However, in decentralized financial (DeFi) smart contracts, the inconsistency between intended behavior and implementation translates into the deviation from the underlying financial model, resulting in monetary losses for the application and its users. In this work, we propose DeFinery - a technique for automated repair of a smart contract that does not satisfy a user-defined correctness property. To explore a larger set of diverse patches while providing formal correctness guarantees w.r.t. the intended behavior, we combine search-based patch generation with semantic analysis of an original program for inferring its specification. Our experiments in repairing 9 real-world and benchmark smart contracts prove that DeFinery efficiently generates high-quality patches that cannot be found by other existing tools.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Anonymous authentication is an important mechanism for providing security and privacy for vehicles in the increasing development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Most of the existing authentication mechanisms depend on a central trusted third party to manage large numbers of certificates or pseudonyms, to conduct the time-consuming database query operations in order to achieve both security and privacy protection for IoV. The huge computation, storage and network bandwidth burden on the central trusted entity affects greatly the performance of the authentication and also leaves potential perils for the whole system. In this paper, we suggest a new authentication scheme for IoV. Distributed authentication is achieved by using blockchain technique, in which large numbers of certificates, public-private key pairs or pseudonyms do not need to be stored in vehicles or central trusted entity. The test results and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can well satisfy the performance requirement of authentication for IoV while preserving privacy for vehicles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market, various types of digital artwork are published via NFT in recent years for sale. In the current NFT system, owner's address of each NFT is stored in plaintext. This leads to a severe privacy problem: once a person's blockchain address is known, all his NFT assets are viewable, which may further cause problems related to the privacy of holding sensitive NFT or premeditated scams to high-value NFT owners. However, due to the limitation of Ethereum and smart contract, it is hard to prevent others from tracking the owner of NFT. Meanwhile, current state-of-the-art NFT research usually assumes the relation between blockchain address and owner's identity is unknown, thus creating the so-called anonymity. In this paper, based on the most popular NFT marketplace OpenSea's system, we propose a new exchange scheme to hides the address of NFT owner during trading. To achieve our goal, a proof of commitment scheme is exploited to bind the owner to an NFT while hiding the identity. Moreover, An anonymous payment method is designed to prevent attackers from tracing the Ether flow in NFT trading. Our scheme is proven to be secure against curious users and malicious active attackers. Implementation on testnet also shows that the increased gas cost is acceptable, meaning it is suitable for application. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract transactions are increasingly interleaved by cross-contract calls. While many tools have been developed to identify a common set of vulnerabilities, the cross-contract vulnerability is overlooked by existing tools. Cross-contract vulnerabilities are exploitable bugs that manifest in the presence of more than two interacting contracts. Existing methods are however limited to analyze a maximum of two contracts at the same time. Detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities is highly non-trivial. With multiple interacting contracts, the search space is much larger than that of a single contract. To address this problem, we present <sc>xFuzz</sc>, a machine learning guided smart contract fuzzing framework. The machine learning models are trained with novel features (e.g., word vectors and instructions) and are used to filter likely benign program paths. Comparing with existing static tools, machine learning model is proven to be more robust, avoiding directly adopting manually-defined rules in specific tools. We compare <sc>xFuzz</sc> with three state-of-the-art tools on 7,391 contracts. <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects 18 exploitable cross-contract vulnerabilities, of which 15 vulnerabilities are exposed for the first time. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be efficient in detecting non-cross-contract vulnerabilities as well&#x2014;using less than 20&#x0025; time as that of other fuzzing tools, <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects twice as many vulnerabilities.

	abstract = {Cloud-based manufacturing is taking shape, and many industries seem interested to make the transition to it. Developing blockchain solutions for trusted computing is also taking its roots. Developing a blockchain-based solution for cloud-based manufacturing systems is a field that is new but also faces limitations and a lack of case studies. Smart contracts are one part of the solution which deals with making blockchain successful in cloud-based manufacturing. As we move towards smart contracts design and development for cloud-based manufacturing, there is no complete survey of smart contract and cloud manufacturing that can highlight critical, challenging issues and limitations. Most of the work found in smart contracts is mostly financial and notary-centric applications. On the cloud manufacturing side, most of the literature deals with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing systems. Therefore, there is a need to study the best practices to start manufacturing supported by blockchain smart contracts. We conducted a scoping review for smart contracts for cloud manufacturing to address the problem mentioned above. We studied the latest case studies and concepts in data extracted from digital libraries and online repositories. Furthermore, we follow the relevance and acceptance criteria of research articles for inclusion and exclusion from this work. This paper focuses on blockchain systems, smart contracts and architecture, smart contracts in the cloud, and the IoT environment. Furthermore, we tried to bridge design and implementation details for readers to understand the patterns that can replicate for cloud-based manufacturing systems. © 2022 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Secure communication is one of the main challenges that are slowing down the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Meanwhile, decentralized applications have also attracted intense attention from the online gambling community, with more and more decentralized gambling platforms created through the help of smart contracts. Compared with conventional gambling platforms, decentralized gambling has transparent rules and a low participation threshold, attracting a substantial number of gamblers. In order to discover gambling behaviors and identify the contracts and addresses involved in gambling, we propose a tool termed ETHGamDet. The tool is able to automatically detect the smart contracts and addresses involved in gambling by scrutinizing the smart contract code and address transaction records. Interestingly, we present a novel LightGBM model with memory components, which possesses the ability to learn from its own misclassifications. As a side contribution, we construct and release a large-scale gambling dataset at https://github.com/AwesomeHuang/Bitcoin-Gambling-Dataset to facilitate future research in this field.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising candidate for space exploration and sustainable energy systems. This transformative technology offers secure and decentralized strategies to process and manipulate space resources. Remote sensing provides viable potential with the coexistence of open data from various sources, such as short-range sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Internet-of-Things (IoT) tags and far-range sensors incorporated on satellites. Open data resources have most recently emerged as attractive connecting parties where owners have shown consent to share data. However, most data owners are anonymous and untrustworthy, which makes shared data likely insecure and unreliable. At present, there are several tools that distribute open data, serving as an intermediate party to link users with data owners. However, these platforms are operated by central authorities who develop guidelines for data ownership, integrity, and access, consequently restricting both users and data owners. Therefore, the need and feasibility of a decentralized system arise for data sharing and retrieving without involving these intermediate limiting parties. This study proposes a blockchain-based system without any central authority to share and retrieve data. Our proposed system features (i) data sharing, (ii) maintaining the historical data, and (iii) retrieving and evaluation of data along with enhanced security. We have also discussed the use of blockchain algorithms based on smart contracts to track space transactions and communications in a secure, verifiable, and transparent manner. We tested the suggested framework in the Windows environment by writing smart contracts prototype on an Ethereum TESTNET blockchain. The results of the study showed that the suggested strategy is efficient, practicable, and free of common security attacks and vulnerabilities. © 2022 by the authors.},

Having billions more devices has contributed to security concerns, and an attack-proof authentication mechanism is the need of the hour to sustain the IoT environment. Securing all devices could be a huge task and require lots of computational power, and can be a bottleneck for devices with fewer computational resources. To improve the authentication mechanism, many researchers have proposed decentralized applications such as blockchain technology for securing fog and IoT environments. Ethereum is considered a popular blockchain platform and is used by researchers to implement the authentication mechanism due to its programable smart contract. In this research, we proposed a secure authentication mechanism with improved performance. Neo blockchain is a platform that has properties that can provide improved security and faster execution. The research utilizes the intrinsic properties of Neo blockchain to develop a secure authentication mechanism. The proposed authentication mechanism is compared with the existing algorithms and shows that the proposed mechanism is 20 to 90 per cent faster in execution time and has over 30 to 70 per cent decrease in registration and authentication when compared to existing methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

Blockchain (BC) is one of the technologies that has been introduced worldwide in recent years. It has been beneficial for the tourism industry, in addition to many other sectors. This article investigates the advantages and disadvantages of BC adoption in the tourism industry, as well as the possible solutions to overcome the challenges. This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) that consists of the operations for detecting, selecting, categorizing, and analyzing relevant articles on a specified subject. It is evident from the results that the majority of the academic works illustrate the benefits of BC implementation and explain its potential by providing diverse models of BC-based systems. However, since BC is a young technology, numerous challenges have appeared on the path to its full adoption in the tourism industry. Possible solutions are the achievement of a collaborative approach among the stakeholders, the deepening of academic research in the field, testing more models of BC-based systems, and the establishment of relevant policies. Consequently, the implications for the theory, practice, policy, and research of this work are significant. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The metaverse aims to bring 3D immersive and personalized experiences to users by leveraging many pertinent technologies. Despite great attention and benefits, a natural question in the metaverse is how to secure its users’ digital content and data. In this regard, blockchain is a promising solution owing to its distinct features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we aim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the metaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and highlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next, we extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from technical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing, data interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we first discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how blockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on key-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things, digital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial intelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the role of blockchain in metaverse applications and services.

Companies typically rely on cloud service providers to implement and adopt regulations. This consulting phase is often time‐consuming, costly, and not transparent. Organizations must trust the third party’s implementation and associated documentation processes. To resolve this dilemma, we present a blockchain‐based reference architecture for the automated, transparent, and notarized attestation of such compliance adaptations. Before proposing a solution, our approach is to understand the underlying research context. We conduct a machine‐learning‐supported systematic literature review to create a knowledge base. A reference architecture, including a prototype for configuring intrusion‐detection systems, is developed using design science research. A mixed‐methods‐based approach is used for the evaluation of the proposed architecture. A quantitative survey is then used to show that the user experience of the developed prototype can be rated as positive, with an average value of 0.7. Finally, two focus group discussions are used to analyze the presented prototype qualitatively. As a result, we demonstrate how to actively support secure and trustworthy communication between a cloud service provider and an organization applying blockchain configurations. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The growth of the enterprise blockchain research supporting supply chain management calls for investigations of their impact and mindfulness of their design, use cases, and pilots. With a blockchain design for the Proof of Delivery (PoD) process management, this paper contributes to learning about performance measurement and the transaction costs implications during the development and application of smart contracts. An experimental design science approach is applied to develop an open-source blockchain to explore ways to make the delivery processes more efficient, the proof of delivery more reliable, and the performance measurements more accurate. The theory of Transaction Costs is applied to evaluate the cost implications of the adoption of smart contracts in the management of the PoD. The findings show that smart contracts make the delivery processes more efficient and proof of delivery more reliable. Yet, the methods and metrics are too complex and qualitative, limiting the smart contract's capability to measure performance. Our findings indicate potential transaction costs reduction by implementing a blockchain-based performance measurement. The complexities of the delivery process and proof of delivery call for pre-contractual steps to identify the processes and performance metrics to design blockchains. Smart contracts need further development and digital aids to handle qualitative inspections and proof of delivery generation during the delivery process. The blockchain requires the system's capacity to record off-chain transactions, such as in case of disputes resolutions.

Lack of trust of the mechanism is the main factor in restricting the development of port supply chains. Blockchains have great potential to solve the trust problem among all participants using port supply chains, which can reduce costs and improve efficiency. As the bridge between blockchains and port supply chains, smart contracts reconstruct the business process of blockchain‐empowered port supply chains. In this article, we present an architecture of a consortium blockchain‐empow-ered port supply chain system, and propose a system verification framework for the smart contracts of port supply chains with probabilistic behaviors. The smart contracts are modeled as DTMCs (Dis-crete‐Time Markov Chains), which are automatically transformed through the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) description of the smart contracts. The requirements are specified by PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic). Moreover, we implement the customs clearance process of the Shanghai Yangshan Port based on blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, and reconstruct the clearance process with smart contracts. We use it to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, and identify the smart contracts that do not meet the expected needs of users. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely and rapidly used to automate financial and business transactions together with blockchains, helping people make agreements while minimizing trusts. With millions of smart contracts deployed on blockchain, various bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have emerged. Following the rapid development of deep learning, many recent studies have used deep learning for vulnerability detection to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. These approaches show effective results on detecting whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not whereas their results on locating suspicious statements responsible for the detected vulnerability are still unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning based two-phase smart contract debugger for reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe vulnerabilities, named as ReVulDL: Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection and Localization. ReVulDL integrates the vulnerability detection and localization into a unified debugging pipeline. For the detection phase, given a smart contract, ReVulDL uses a graph-based pre-training model to learn the complex relationships in propagation chains for detecting whether the smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability. For the localization phase, if a reentrancy vulnerability is detected, ReVulDL utilizes interpretable machine learning to locate the suspicious statements in smart contract to provide interpretations of the detected vulnerability. Our large-scale empirical study on 47,398 smart contracts shows that ReVulDL achieves promising results in detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities (e.g., outperforming 16 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches) and locating vulnerable statements (e.g., 70.38% of the vulnerable statements are ranked within Top-10).  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has revolutionized traditional agriculture with intelligence and automation. In a typical Intelligent Agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the Cloud Server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics. Author},

	abstract = {As is well known, smart contracts on the blockchain store plenty of digital assets, and these contracts deployed on the blockchain are difficult to be modified. For this reason, the analysis and detection of smart contract vulnerabilities have received extensive attention. Smartcheck, a typical Java-implemented static analysis tool of smart contracts, is capable of converting Solidity source code into path diagrams based on the lexical and syntactic analysis, and finds smart contract vulnerabilities by path matching. Although Smartcheck can analyze most of the real-world vulnerabilities, some imperceptible vulnerabilities may be ignored, causing huge economic losses. In order to address these issues, we develop a new tool named MSmart to analyze the vulnerabilities of high risk such as timestamp dependence vulnerabilities, integer overflow vulnerabilities, self-destruct vulnerabilities, etc. MSmart converts the smart contract source code into an intermediate representation, and looks for smart contract vulnerabilities based on intermediate representation and XPath rules. We add new intermediate representation rules of Smartcheck to detect more kinds of vulnerabilities and optimize existing rules to suit the complexity of smart contract. We also implemented smart contract batch detection to shorten the time it takes to find vulnerabilities. To analysis the performance of MSmart, we collect 6000 real-world contracts from Etherscan and design some comparative experiments with other tools. The results of experiment show that MSmart is able to analyze related vulnerabilities better, and false positives and false negatives have been reduced due to our improvements. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the IoT ecosystem is evolving rapidly, with multiple heterogeneous sources producing high volumes of data and processes transforming this data into meaningful or 'smart' information. These volumes of data, including IoT data, need to be stored in repositories that can host raw, unprocessed, relational and non-relational types of data, such as Data Lakes. Due to the weakness of metadata management, security & access control is one of the main challenges of Big Data storage architectures as Data Lakes can be replaced without oversight of the contents. Recently, the Blockchain technology has been introduced as an effective solution to build trust between different entities, where trust is either nonexistent or unproven, and to address security and privacy concerns. In this paper we introduce DLMetaChain, an extended Data Lake metadata mechanism that consists of data from heterogeneous data sources which interact with IoT data. The extended mechanism mainly focuses on developing an architecture to ensure that the data in the Data Lake is not modified or altered by taking into advantage the capabilities of the Blockchain.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {IoT environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in terms of their distributions and included entities by collaboratively involving not only data centers known from Cloud computing but also the different types of third-party entities that can provide computing resources. To transparently provide such resources and facilitate trust between the involved entities, it is necessary to develop and implement smart contracts. However, when developing smart contracts, developers face many challenges and concerns, such as security, contracts’ correctness, a lack of documentation and/or design patterns, and others. To address this problem, we propose a new recommender system to facilitate the development and implementation of low-cost EVM-enabled smart contracts. The recommender system’s algorithm provides the smart contract developer with smart contract templates that match their requirements and that are relevant to the typology of the fog architecture. It mainly relies on OpenZeppelin, a modular, reusable, and secure smart contract library that we use when classifying the smart contracts. The evaluation results indicate that by using our solution, the smart contracts’ development times are overall reduced. Moreover, such smart contracts are sustainable for fog-computing IoT environments and applications in low-cost EVM-based ledgers. The recommender system has been successfully implemented in the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem, thus presenting its applicability. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a developing technology that can provide users with such advantages as decentralization, data security, and transparency of transactions. Blockchain has many applications, one of them is the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. DeFi is a huge aggregator of various financial blockchain protocols. At the moment, the total value locked in these protocols reaches USD 82 billion. Every day more and more new users come to DeFi with their investments. The concept of decentralized finance involves the creation of a single ecosystem of many blockchains that interact with each other. The problem of combining and interacting blockchains becomes crucial to enable DeFi. In this paper, we look at the essence of the DeFi industry, the possibilities of overcoming the problem of cross-blockchain interaction, present our approach to solving this problem with the Wish Swap platform, which, in particular, provides improved fault-tolerance for cross-chain interaction by using multiple backend nodes and multisignatures.

	abstract = {Data assets trading can encourage owners to distribute data and achieve large-scale data aggregation to promote the development of the supply chain system. Blockchain is a promising platform for constructing a decentralized data marketplace. The data may face risks in the marketplace, such as illegal theft, malicious tampering, or illegal distribution in the transactions process. The data ownership confirmation in a blockchain-empowered marketplace has attracted much attention in recent years. However, challenges still remain, including maintaining data integrity, traceability of illegal data, and accountability. In this paper, we propose a new data ownership confirmation scheme (DOCS) in the transaction scenario of blockchain-empowered distributed data assets trading. It integrates smart contracts, data-embedding technology, and data fingerprint to realize ownership confirmation and protection of data assets in transactions. DOCS ensures reliable mapping between on-chain data ownership information and off-chain data entities, which assists with the accurate prosecution of the illegal distribution of data assets. We demonstrate that DOCS can have desirable security properties in multiple attack models. © 2022 by the authors.},

DeTi offers a dedicated service management functionality by operating through Smart Contracts of Ethereum, such that users can verify tickets’ validity for a given event. Especially, a new mechanism for users to detect fraudulent events is introduced, too. The evaluation performed indicates that DeTi invalidates or validates tickets efficiently via its decentralized and BC-based service management approach. By securing technically a set of underlying processes, DeTi obviates forging, replication, and scalping of tickets, allowing for a well-managed resale ecosystem of tickets based on and limited to the organizers’ initial pricing. © 2022, The Author(s).},

In this paper, the architecture of the bond trading system is optimized by using the technology of blockchain, and the software architecture is developed by using the technology of blockchain. Through the performance test of the system, the advantages of the system architecture in practical application are verified. Firstly, the overall hardware architecture of the system is designed, and the internal structure of the controller in the control layer is redeployed. Combining the Mork tree and Patricia tree, the data structure based on blockchain and the block header data structure of the transaction contract system are optimized. By analyzing the operation process of the smart contract, the process of the smart contract consensus algorithm is optimized. The system performance test results show that the performance of the designed system in system transaction throughput, transaction delay, and system security is better than the traditional system, which verifies the effectiveness and reliability of the designed system.  © 2022 Zheng Xu and Ji Liu.},

This article presents a blockchain-IoT-based system for the control and monitoring of these events, aiming to catalog in smart contracts valuable information for improvement of the cocoa fermentation process, and future research. Blockchain is used as a distributed database that implements an application-level security layer. A proof of concept was modeled and the performance of the emulated system was evaluated in the OMNet simulator, where a technique based on the SNMP protocol was applied to reduce the amount of data exchanged and resources served/consumed in this representation. Then, a physical platform was developed and preliminary experiments were performed on a real farm, as a way to verify the improvement of the cocoa fermentation process when using a technological approach. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the last two years, due to the pandemic and restrictive measures, the dependence of music creators and artists on the Internet, where they could promote their work, organize live streaming concerts, and talk to the public, has increased and expanded even more and seeks higher revenue from digital music platforms. An important issue that arises from the above statement is protecting the authors' copyright regarding the uses and sharing in the digital services of their works with protected content. Although circulated in digital information, the protected content is not information but a product of ethical and commercial value. While it has an intangible owner and it owes its existence to the creative idea of its creator, it is not an idea. The imposition of legal and commercial conditions on its movement cannot be associated with any restrictions on the free movement of information, as it is not related to them. In general, the unauthorized exchange of digital music files via peer-to-peer violates copyright law. The exchange of files is unauthorized, as it does not have the relevant permission from the creators and beneficiaries and is therefore illegal. With this in mind, this paper proposes a highly effective way of protecting the copyright of music technology, which is based on the widespread use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptography technologies. Specifically, an advanced blockchain model based on Hyperledger Fabric is introduced, which, however, uses Quantum Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Zero-Knowledge Arguments. Music files are implemented as Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs), which activate smart contracts. Finally, an advanced collaborative filtering algorithm provides recommendations for effectiveness in securing the copyrights of music industry creators. A specialized scenario was built to model the proposed system to verify the degree of protection on music intellectual property in developing a security simulation with an innovative consensus-based zero knowledge and the quantum fully homomorphic encryption technique. Experiment results show that this technique can aid in implementing a technologically aware system capable of providing a powerful answer to a current real-world problem.  © 2022 Na Li.},

	abstract = {Large-scale Machine Learning (ML) based Software Systems are increasingly developed by distributed teams situated in different trust domains. Insider threats can launch attacks from any domain to compromise ML assets (models and datasets). Therefore, practitioners require information about how and by whom ML assets were developed to assess their quality attributes such as security, safety, and fairness. Unfortunately, it is challenging for ML teams to access and reconstruct such historical information of ML assets (ML provenance) because it is generally fragmented across distributed ML teams and threatened by the same adversaries that attack ML assets. This paper proposes ProML, a decentralised platform that leverages blockchain and smart contracts to empower distributed ML teams to jointly manage a single source of truth about circulated ML assets’ provenance without relying on a third party, which is vulnerable to insider threats and presents a single point of failure. We propose a novel architectural approach called Artefact-as-a-State-Machine to leverage blockchain transactions and smart contracts for managing ML provenance information and introduce a user-driven provenance capturing mechanism to integrate existing scripts and tools to ProML without compromising participants’ control over their assets and toolchains. We evaluate the performance and overheads of ProML by benchmarking a proof-of-concept system on a global blockchain. Furthermore, we assessed ProML’s security against a threat model of a distributed ML workflow. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize the model. Our experimental studies on over 11K real-world Ethereum smart contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition, our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is being used in many applications, including supply chain management. The primary goal of using a blockchain for supply chain management is to reduce the overall production cost while providing comprehensive security to the system. However, current blockchain-based supply-chain workflow(s) (BSW) are still susceptible to various cyber threats due to evolving business processes of different stakeholders involved in the process. In fact, current BSW protects the supply chain process based on the rules that have been implemented in the corresponding smart contracts. However, in practice, the requirements for the process keep evolving due to several organizational policies and directives of the involved stakeholders; therefore, current blockchain-based solutions fail to protect the supply chain process against attacks that exploit the process-related information that is not protected by smart contracts. Therefore, the goal of this work was to develop a methodology that enhances the protection of BSW against various internal (e.g., Stuxnet) and external (e.g., local data breach of a stakeholder) cyber threats through monitoring the stakeholder business process. Our methodology complements the blockchain-based solution because it protects the stakeholder’s local process against the attacks that exploit the process information that is not protected in the smart contracts. We implemented a prototype and demonstrated its application to a typical supply chain workflow example application by successfully detecting internal and external attacks to the application. © 2022 by the authors.

However, centralized authoriza-tion, untransparent transaction information and risk of tampering data in traditional digital rights management have a strong impact on system normal operation. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based digital rights management scheme (BMDRM) that realizes a distributed digital rights management and authorization system by introducing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts. To ensure the security and efficiency of transactions and authorization, we store all processing data in a high-security distributed ledger based on crypto-graphic signatures. We test our scheme on Ethereum private network and the experimental results show that BMDRM is feasible and secure for digital rights management in museums. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {The vulnerability of solar power producers to sunshine fluctuations exposes them to the volumetric risk that future electricity generation may deviate from predicted generation. Weather derivatives have recently emerged as a tool for hedging the volumetric risks of these power producers. However, the state-of-the-art instruments have several shortcomings, contributing to their limited application in the industry. Therefore, novel solar radiation-based weather derivative smart contract arrangements on a blockchain marketplace are proposed to address some of the main limitations of traditional instruments. In this regard, the cash flow of solar generators is modelled to assess the weather elements causing its stochasticity. Using this information, novel smart contract arrangements on a blockchain marketplace with solar radiation days as the underlying weather index are developed and analytically valued. Thereafter, a suite of novel smart contract autonomous mechanisms compelling contracting parties to behave rationally and maintain an enduring arrangement is presented. Finally, a trading strategy based on the developed smart contract arrangements is proposed to minimize the power producers' volatility risk. Results emanating from notional simulations indicate that the proposed approach could be more suitable for hedging the volumetric risks of solar power producers than traditional instruments.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

Smart contracts are used in most of the blockchain applications like cryptocurrency, Health care, banking sectors, supply chain and IOT with different platforms like Fabric, Ethereum, Corda etc. In Ethereum blockchain, due to lack of inefficiency of the knowledge of technical developers and insecure programming languages for smart contracts, the attackers have exploited the smart contracts and the end users have lost millions of dollars like re-entrancy, king of ether throne attack, DoS, forcefully send ethers, multisig wallet, unexpected ether and poly network attack etc. In the year 2016, the attackers have exploited approximately $289 million US dollars with the help of re-entrancy vulnerability. The attackers have also attacked the smart contracts and broke the execution of that particular contracts through king of ether throne attack.

	abstract = {The rapid development of three-dimensional (3D) acquisition technology based on 3D sensors provides a large volume of data, which are often represented in the form of point clouds. Point cloud representation can preserve the original geometric information along with associated attributes in a 3D space. Therefore, it has been widely adopted in many scene-understanding-related applications such as virtual reality (VR) and autonomous driving. However, the massive amount of point cloud data aggregated from distributed 3D sensors also poses challenges for secure data collection, management, storage, and sharing. Thanks to the characteristics of decentralization and security, Blockchain has great potential to improve point cloud services and enhance security and privacy preservation. Inspired by the rationales behind the software-defined network (SDN) technology, this paper envisions SAUSA, a Blockchain-based authentication network that is capable of recording, tracking, and auditing the access, usage, and storage of 3D point cloud datasets in their life-cycle in a decentralized manner. SAUSA adopts an SDN-inspired point cloud service architecture, which allows for efficient data processing and delivery to satisfy diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. A Blockchain-based authentication framework is proposed to ensure security and privacy preservation in point cloud data acquisition, storage, and analytics. Leveraging smart contracts for digitizing access control policies and point cloud data on the Blockchain, data owners have full control of their 3D sensors and point clouds. In addition, anyone can verify the authenticity and integrity of point clouds in use without relying on a third party. Moreover, SAUSA integrates a decentralized storage platform to store encrypted point clouds while recording references of raw data on the distributed ledger. Such a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage strategy not only improves robustness and availability, but also ensures privacy preservation for sensitive information in point cloud applications. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and tested on a physical network. The experimental evaluation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed SAUSA solution. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2019 has seen unprecedented demand for medical equipment and supplies. However, the problem of waste treatment has not yet been given due attention, i.e., the traditional waste treatment process is done independently, and it is not easy to share the necessary information. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the interaction between parties is minimized to limit infections. To evaluate the current system at medical centers, we also refer to the traditional waste treatment processes of four hospitals in Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh cities (Vietnam). Almost all hospitals are handled independently, lacking any interaction between the stakeholders. In this article, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based system for automating waste treatment processes for medical equipment and supplies after usage among the relevant parties, named Medical-Waste Chain. It consists of four components: medical equipment and supplies, waste centers, recycling plants, and sorting factories. Medical-Waste Chain integrates blockchain-based Hyperledger Fabric technology with decentralized storage of medical equipment and supply information, and securely shares related data with stakeholders. We present the system design, along with the interactions among the stakeholders, to ensure the minimization of medical waste generation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using system-wide timing and latency analysis based on the Hyperledger Caliper engine. Our system is developed based on the hybrid-blockchain system, so it is fully scalable for both on-chain and off-chain-based extensions. Moreover, the participants do not need to pay any fees to use and upgrade the system. To encourage future use of Medical-Waste Chain, we also share a proof-of-concept on our Github repository. © 2022 by the authors.},

The main innovative aspect of this solution is the integration that is offered between an Academic Management System (the Fenix.edu platform) and a Blockchain (Ethereum) to automatically deploy diplomas. This solution helps the involved stakeholders trust the diplomas provided. The case study involves four different stakeholders and studies, specifically, the increase in their satisfaction in terms of diploma control, diploma veracity, and diploma credibility. The developed system was tested with external participants who were asked to follow a set of guidelines and complete a survey to assess their perceptions.

	abstract = {Smart contracts running on public blockchains are permissionless and decentralized, attracting both developers and malicious participants. Ethereum, the world’s largest decentralized application platform on which more than 40 million smart contracts are running, is frequently challenged by smart contract vulnerabilities. What’s worse, since the homogeneity of a wide range of smart contracts and the increase in inter-contract dependencies, a vulnerability in a certain smart contract could affect a large number of other contracts in Ethereum. However, little is known about how vulnerable contracts affect other on-chain contracts and which contracts can be affected. Thus, we first present the contract dependency graph (CDG) to perform a vulnerability analysis for Ethereum smart contracts, where CDG characterizes inter-contract dependencies formed by DELEGATECALL-type internal transaction in Ethereum. Then, three generic definitions of security violations against CDG are given for finding respective potential victim contracts affected by different types of vulnerable contracts. Further, we construct the CDG with 195,247 smart contracts active in the latest blocks of the Ethereum and verify the above security violations against CDG by detecting three representative known vulnerabilities. Compared to previous large-scale vulnerability analysis, our analysis scheme marks potential victim contracts that can be affected by different types of vulnerable contracts, and identify their possible risks based on the type of security violation actually occurring. The analysis results show that the proportion of potential victim contracts reaches 14.7%, far more than that of corresponding vulnerable contracts (less than 0.02%) in CDG. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Consumers in electricity markets are becoming more proactive because of the rapid development of demand–response management and distributed energy resources, which boost the transformation of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy-trading mechanisms. However, in the P2P negotiation process, it is a challenging task to prevent private information from being attacked by malicious agents. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving, two-party, secure computation mechanism for consensus-based P2P energy trading. First, a novel P2P negotiation mechanism for energy trading is proposed based on the consensus + innovation (C + I) method and the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF), and this mechanism can simultaneously maximize social welfare and maintain physical network constraints. In addition, the C + I method only requires a minimum set of information to be exchanged. Then, we analyze the strategy of malicious neighboring agents colluding to attack in order to steal private information. To defend against this attack, we propose a two-party, secure computation mechanism in order to realize safe negotiation between each pair of prosumers based on Paillier homomorphic encryption (HE), a smart contract (SC), and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). The energy price is updated in a safe way without leaking any private information. Finally, we simulate the functionality of the privacy-preserving mechanism in terms of convergence performance, computational efficiency, scalability, and SC operations. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {E-commerce has developed greatly in recent years, as such, its regulations have become one of the most important research areas in order to implement a sustainable market. The analysis of a large amount of reviews data generated in the shopping process can be used to facilitate regulation: since the review data is short text and it is easy to extract the features through deep learning methods. Through these features, the sentiment analysis of the review data can be carried out to obtain the users’ emotional tendency for a specific product. Regulators can formulate reasonable regulation strategies based on the analysis results. However, the data has many issues such as poor reliability and easy tampering at present, which greatly affects the outcome and can lead regulators to make some unreasonable regulatory decisions according to these results. Blockchain provides the possibility of solving these problems due to its trustfulness, transparency and unmodifiable features. Based on these, the blockchain can be applied for data storage, and the Long short-term memory (LSTM) network can be employed to mine reviews data for emotional tendencies analysis. In order to improve the accuracy of the results, we designed a method to make LSTM better understand text data such as reviews containing idioms. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, different experiments were used for verification, with all results showing that the proposed method can achieve a good outcome in the sentiment analysis leading to regulators making better decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, we focus on the issue of a lack of efficient decentralized mechanisms in DLTs and DFSs for querying a certain type of data. For this reason, we propose the use of a hypercube-structured Distributed Hash Table (DHT) on top of DLTs, organized for efficient processing of multiple keyword-based queries on the ledger data. We test our approach with the implementation of a use case regarding the creation of citizen-generated data based on direct participation and the involvement of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of our approach for decentralized data searches, distributed authorization mechanisms and smart contract exploitation. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the continuous cross-border cooperation among industries, the concept of an industrial interconnection supply and demand network is constantly mentioned. As industry interconnectivity continues to grow, collaboration models have changed as companies work more closely with each other, and the synergy model has changed. In order to improve the efficiency of collaboration and to promote the free allocation of resources in the trading process of the industry interconnection supply and demand network, an industry interconnection supply and demand network resource matching platform based on the Alliance blockchain was built, steps for resource trading on the platform were proposed. Using blockchain technology’s smart contract technology to simplify the transaction process, the triggering mechanism and algorithm rules of smart contracts in the trading process of the platform were designed, and the smart contract code was developed, deployed, and tested using Remix IDE, and the test results showed the transaction process between the supply and demand sides. Through blockchain technology, it achieves information security and transparency in the process of resource trading in the industry interconnection supply and demand network, establishes a trust mechanism on both sides of the transaction, reduces redundant steps in the transaction and improves the operational efficiency of the industry interconnection supply and demand network by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Recent developments in telecommunication world have allowed customers to share the storage and processing capabilities of their devices by providing services through fast and reliable connections. This evolution, however, requires building an incentive system to encourage information exchange in future telecommunication networks. In this study, we propose a mechanism to share bandwidth and processing resources among subscribers using smart contracts and a blockchain-based incentive mechanism, which is used to encourage subscribers to share their resources. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method through two use cases: (i) exchanging multimedia data and (ii) CPU sharing. We propose a universal user-to-user and user-to-operator payment system, named TelCash, which provides a solution for current roaming problems and establishes trust in X2X communications. TelCash has a great potential in solving the charges of roaming and reputation management (reliance) problems in telecommunications sector. We also show, by using a simulation study, that encouraging D2D communication leads to a significant increase in content quality, and there is a threshold after which downloading from base station is dramatically cut down and can be kept as low as 10%. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency where all the transactions are saved in a ledger. Blockchains have good features to be used in different finance applications by using smart contract. Also, blockchains are attractive platform for many industrial domains, including the logistics and supply chain industries. Supply chain technology contributes to record every single asset through its flow, tracking orders, receipts, and payments. There are several relay protocols proposed in previous research; these relay protocols are used to connect different types of blockchains. In this paper, we present a Secure Organizational Transactions Framework (SOTF) based on bridge chain to connect private chain or consortium with public chain which reduces interaction with public blockchain and saves the organization details privately in private chain or consortium. The proposed framework makes it possible for smart contract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium and private chain. Moreover, the proposed framework automates the process of updating the payment non-interactively. In this paper, we validate the communication between organizations blockchain and bitcoin, and find out the development cost of the proposed framework which ensures the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed framework.

	abstract = {With the development and application of energy Internet technology, the collaborative interaction of "source network, load and storage" has become the development trend of power grid dispatching. The large-scale access of renewable energy on the load side, the unified management of adjustable loads, and the participation of multiple parties in energy operations have put forward requirements for the safety, credibility, openness, and transparency of the load dispatching environment. Under the environment of carbon emission reduction, the paper proposed an architecture of the scheduling data blockchain, based on the in-depth study of blockchain. Moreover, smart contracts are used to realize the application scenario of load dispatching instruction evidence on the blockchain. The content and storage mode of scheduling instruction evidence on blockchain are studied. And different storage modes are adopted according to the actual needs. And the smart contract system realizes the evidence generation of power dispatching instruction. This is the basis for the normal circulation of power dispatching instruction evidence. The research significance of this paper is highlighted as follows. The data and information generated in the power dispatching process are stored as evidence. On the one hand, it can provide a basis for settlement between power production and dispatching companies and power users. On the other hand, it can prepare for distributed transactions in the power grid under the environment of carbon emission reduction. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of physical networks, tens of billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been deployed worldwide. Access control is essential in the IoT system, which manages user access to vital IoT data. However, access control for the IoT is mainly based on centralized trusted servers, which face problems such as a single point of failure and data leakage. To tackle these challenges, we propose an access control framework for the IoT by combining blockchain and Intel software guard extension (SGX) technology. A blockchain validates both IoT devices and edge servers added to the network. The access control contract is deployed on the blockchain, which can manage attribute-based access control policies in a fine-grained manner and make access control decisions flexibly. SGX technology is introduced into the edge computing server to realize the confidentiality of data processing. Finally, we implemented the prototype of the framework on Quorum and conducted extensive experiments and theoretical analyses on the performance of the blockchain. The results of the experimental tests and theoretical analyses show that our framework has more advantages in computing costs and on-chain storage costs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the context of the rapid development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have also been widely used in the Internet of Things, finance, healthcare, and other fields. There has been an explosion in the number of smart contracts, and at the same time, the security of smart contracts has received widespread attention because of the financial losses caused by smart contract vulnerabilities. Existing analysis tools can detect many smart contract security vulnerabilities, but because they rely too heavily on hard rules defined by experts when detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, the time to perform the detection increases significantly as the complexity of the smart contract increases. In the present study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model named CBGRU that strategically combines different word embedding (Word2Vec, FastText) with different deep learning methods (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN, BiGRU). The model extracts features through different deep learning models and combine these features for smart contract vulnerability detection. On the currently publicly available dataset SmartBugs Dataset-Wild, we demonstrate that the CBGRU hybrid model has great smart contract vulnerability detection performance through a series of experiments. By comparing the performance of the proposed model with that of past studies, the CBGRU model has better smart contract vulnerability detection performance. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The key issue in the field of smart contract security is efficient and rapid vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Most of the existing detection methods can only detect the presence of vulnerabilities in the contract and can hardly identify their type. Furthermore, they have poor scalability. To resolve these issues, in this study, we developed a smart contract vulnerability detection model based on multi‐task learning. By setting auxiliary tasks to learn more directional vulnerability features, the detection capability of the model was improved to realize the detection and recognition of vulnerabilities. The model is based on a hard‐sharing design, which consists of two parts. First, the bottom sharing layer is mainly used to learn the semantic information of the input contract. The text representation is first transformed into a new vector by word and positional embedding, and then the neural network, based on an attention mechanism, is used to learn and extract the feature vector of the contract. Second, the task‐specific layer is mainly employed to realize the functions of each task. A classical convolutional neural network was used to construct a classification model for each task that learns and extracts features from the shared layer for training to achieve their respective task objectives. The experimental results show that the model can better identify the types of vulnerabilities after adding the auxiliary vulnerability detection task. This model realizes the detection of vulnerabilities and recognizes three types of vulnerabilities. The multi‐task model was observed to perform better and is less expensive than a single‐task model in terms of time, computation, and storage. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The digitization of the national economy and the development of the national network have rapidly increased the amount of data, and research in content storage and forwarding is significant. The existing methods of storing certificates and distributing file content entirely rely on the judgment made by the router, and the forwarding process does not consider the security and legality of the data; at the same time, the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) forwarding network files cannot be effectively reused, and additional security mechanisms are introduced. It affects the performance of the network itself. To improve the overall network performance, optimize the file forwarding process, and ensure the security of content and the verification of historical information, this paper proposes a method for document content storage and distribution that integrates blockchain technology and Named Data Network (NDN). The advantages of data signature encryption, reverse path forwarding of content, and flexible routing improves the overall performance of the forwarding network. Combined with blockchain decentralization technology, the documents and transaction processes can be stored on the chain to ensure the actual security of the forwarding process. In addition, this paper restricts the forwarding process in the NDN network without making any judgments through smart contract rules to ensure the security of confidential files during the forwarding process and, at the same time, limit the forwarding scope of irrelevant junk files in the private network. Finally, experiments prove that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the network's overall performance, optimize the forwarding process, and make rule judgments on the forwarding process of specific files to ensure the security of files.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, more and more applications are developed for running on a distributed ledger technology, namely dApps. The business logic of dApps is usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii) assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants. On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption perspective. An experiment involving 2186 smart contracts demonstrates that the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code segments that need optimizations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Following the success of bitcoin, the first practical application of blockchain, it is being implemented in other fields such as healthcare, supply chains, financial management, real estate, electoral systems, and so on. Blockchain’s core features include decentralization, immutability, and interminability. Most version control repositories are centralized and can be modified by external sources, implying that they are in danger of being corrupted or controlled. In this study, we present the BDA-SCV architecture for implementing a version control system in blockchain technology. Our proposed approach would replace the necessity for a centralized system, with a decentralized approach implemented in the blockchain using distributed file storage, for which we will use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which is a distributed file system. The proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm will be used to approve the developer communicating modifications to the private blockchain network; the authority will only provide permission and will not be able to add, edit, or delete code files. For each change, a ledger block will be created with a reference to the file stored in the distributed repository. A block cannot be manipulated once it has been created. Smart contracts will be used to register developers, create blocks, and manage the repository. The suggested model is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric network, and the developer and authorizer ends are built into the dotnet web application. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and compelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Smart contracts from various fields now hold over one trillion dollars worth of virtual coins, attracting numerous attacks. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state of the contract and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence S 1 by appending a new sequence S 2 , so that the appended sequence S 2 can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state; 2) we incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch; 3) we engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods, and (iii) IR-Fuzz is fast, generating an average of 350 test cases per second. Our implementation and dataset are released at https://github.com/Messi-Q/IR-Fuzz, hoping to facilitate future research.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electronic Health Record (EHR) and its privacy have attracted widespread attention with the development of the healthcare industry in recent years. As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this article, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that MedShare is efficient for EHR sharing. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based platforms utilise cryptographic protocols to enforce the correct behaviour of users, as well as to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against malicious adversaries. Cryptography is, however, an ever-evolving discipline, and any breakthrough would have immediate consequences on the security of blockchain-based applications. A possible threat currently under investigation is given by the development of quantum computers, since several wide-adopted cryptographic protocols have been proved to be unsafe against quantum-capable adversaries. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the management of cryptographic primitives in smart-contract-based ledgers, discussing how it fits in both a (partially) permissioned and a fully permissionless setting. The cryptographic protocols are managed in a flexible manner via a set of smart-contracts defined on the ledger itself, in this way the choice of algorithms and parameters can change quickly. Among the advantages of this approach, we remark how it allows designing an adaptive post-quantum-based blockchain that keeps up with ongoing technological advances. In general, the introduction of new features and the application of fixes to a blockchain cause forks in the chain, which may cause major disruptions. The use of smart contracts in blockchain management allows to avoid this problem, dynamically introducing new protocols or deprecating old ones without compromising previous data. The Cryptographic Kernel approach has been adopted by Quadrans, an open-source, public, decentralised smart-contract-based blockchain with a specific focus on the needs of industry, complex supply chains, and IOT devices. © 2022 by the authors.

This system is more economically advisable than face-to-face voting by eliminating the need to pay poll staff. It may also make voting more accessible to the population with impairments and those living overseas. This study will propose an e-voting system based on smart contracts by using a decentralized private Blockchain. The proposed e-voting system will provide transparency, accuracy, fairness, eligibility, anonymity, verifiability, and immutability. This research proposed the most secure way of voting with the help of Blockchain using a mobile application that can be used to implement a large-scale solution and is cost-effective. The Blockchain-based system has been designed in conjunction with the existing ECC cryptosystem to assure the dependability, anonymity, and security of votes and voters. The system that has been developed can be used to properly conduct elections, using a quick response code (QR Code), face recognition, and fingerprint for identification before casting a ballot to ensure eligibility. This results in using mobile smartphones in the voting process where voters can observe the transparency of their votes. Furthermore, eliminates the possibility of fraud and manipulation of the votes made due to the used blockchain for secure storage. © 2022 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts constitute the foundation for blockchain distributed applications. These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Fog computing has become a complementary technology to cloud computing and addresses some of the cloud computing threats such as the response time and network bandwidth demand. Fog computing successes processing data and storing data near to the edge, and usually is combined with container virtualization to provide hardware isolation. Empowered by these capabilities, numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications are developed as virtualized instances on resource-constrained fog nodes such as single-board computers (SBC). In addition, blockchain has emerged as a key technology that is transforming the way we share information. Blockchain technology represents a decentralised, distributed, and immutable database ledger and is a potential solution for the distributed ecosystem of IoT applications. The distributed structure of blockchain is naturally suitable for IoT applications. However, it introduces new challenges related to CPU overhead or response time. This paper proposes a layered architecture that integrates blockchain technology and OS-level virtualization technology to develop fog-based IoT applications. It also provides insights for future deployments through a proof-of-concept use case harnessing SBCs, in this case Raspberry Pi, as blockchain-enabled fog nodes to drive virtualized IoT applications. The study shows that the maximum CPU overhead added by a permissioned blockchain based on Ethereum on the Raspberry Pi is around a 25% under stress situations while the overhead introduced by the sealer process is negligible. These results support the feasibility of using blockchain on resource-constrained fog nodes for supporting IoT applications. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Traditionally, food sustainability has been considered solely in the stage of agricultural production. However, globalization, the expansion of the food production industry, and the emergence of supermarket chains that control the retail food market require specific significant changes in supply chains in the food sector and, therefore, we need to address the economic, social, and environmental impacts of these events. On the other hand, social selling has increased rapidly in recent years, with a further boom, following current events related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This explosion of social sales, where there are usually no control and regulation entities, can bring problems associated with mishandling items. In this paper, we expose how Blockchain technology supports the traceability of social sales by validating the data provided by the chain participants such as digital health passports, production and transport data in the sale process; the proposed solution generates recommendations on productmanagement considering the agreements previously made by the network actors. To evaluate the proposed smart contracts, we useHyperledger Caliper, obtaining an average throughput of 12.6 transactions per second and an average latency of 0.3 s for the asset update process. We also use a study case to evaluate the proposed project platform's selling-transport stage using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts have shown growing popularity across blockchains (e.g., EOSIO) recently. Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, Wasm smart contracts suffer from various attacks exploiting their vulnerabilities. Even worse, few developers released the source code of their Wasm smart contracts for security review, raising the bar for uncovering vulnerable contracts. Although a few approaches have been proposed to detect vulnerable Wasm smart contracts, they have several major limitations, e.g., low code coverage, low accuracy and lack of scalability, unable to produce exploit payloads, etc. To fill the gap, in this paper, we design and develop WASAI, a new concolic fuzzer for uncovering vulnerabilities in Wasm smart contract after tackling several challenging issues. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate WASAI, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. For example, it achieves 2x code coverage than the baselines and surpasses them in detection accuracy, with an F1-measure of 99.2%. Moreover, WASAI can handle complicated contracts (e.g., contracts with obfuscation and sophisticated verification). Applying WASAI to 991 deployed smart contracts in the wild, we find that over 70% of smart contracts are vulnerable. By the time of this study, over 300 vulnerable contracts have not been patched and are still operating on the EOSIO Mainnet. One fake EOS vulnerability reported to the EOSIO ecosystem was recently assigned a CVE identifier (CVE-2022-27134).  © 2022 ACM.},

At the same time, most access systems lack the ability to identify network attacks and cannot adopt dynamic and timely defenses against various security threats. To this end, we propose a blockchain-based access control and behavior regulation system for IoT. Relying on the attribute-based access control model, this system deploys smart contracts on the blockchain to achieve distributed and fine-grained access control and ensures that the identity and authority of access users can be trusted. At the same time, an inter-domain communication mechanism is designed based on the locator/identifier separation protocol and ensures the traffic of access users are authorized. A feedback module that combines traffic detection and credit evaluation is proposed, ensuring real-time detection and fast, proactive responses against malicious behavior. Ultimately, all modules are linked together through workflows to form an integrated security model. Experiments and analysis show that the system can effectively provide comprehensive security protection in IoT scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {By 2050, the world's population will have increased by 34%, to more than 9 billion people, needing a 70% increase in food production. Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain's transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item's authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m2 cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system. By 2050, the world's population will need a 70% increase in food production. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model.

Deep learning neural network is applied to the vulnerability analysis and detection of smart contracts in blockchain technology by analyzing the connotation of blockchain technology and deep learning. A multiparty joint financial service platform based on blockchain technology is established to help SMEs financing institutions reduce transaction costs, thereby helping them reduce loan interest rates. Finally, Jiangsu Province is studied as a pilot unit. The results show that the Recall and F-score of Bidirectional Neural Network for smart contract vulnerability detection are higher than those of the original neural network. The Recall rate and F-score value of the Wide and Deep model are up to 96.2% and 94.7%, which are higher than those of other vulnerability detection schemes. The Timestamp vulnerability has the highest Recall rate, 94.2%, which can rely on a large amount of valid data to improve detection efficiency. The distribution of financing needs of SMEs in Jiangsu Province from 2020 to 2021 shows that the loan number of SMEs is generally not high. Still, financial institutions and enterprises must spend the same transaction cost. After a technology company in Nanjing made a loan through a blockchain financial service platform, its financing cost decreased by 0.5331%.

	abstract = {Current blockchain‐based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self‐adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self‐adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so‐called selfadaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE‐BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self‐adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t‐test and Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self‐adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Growing intelligent cities is witnessing an increasing amount of local energy generation through renewable energy resources. Energy trade among the local energy generators (aka prosumers) and consumers can reduce the energy consumption cost and also reduce the dependency on conventional energy resources, not to mention the environmental, economic, and societal benefits. However, these local energy sources might not be enough to fulfill energy consumption demands. A hybrid approach, where consumers can buy energy from both prosumers (that generate energy) and also from prosumer of other locations, is essential. A centralized system can be used to manage this energy trading that faces several security issues and increase centralized development cost. In this paper, a hybrid energy trading system coupled with a smart contract named SynergyGrids has been proposed as a solution, that reduces the average cost of energy and load over the utility grids. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to create a hybrid energy trading platform over the smart contract for energy demand prediction. An hourly energy data set has been utilized for testing and validation purposes. The trading system shows 17.8% decrease in energy cost for consumers and 76.4% decrease in load over utility grids when compared with its counterparts. © 2021, The Author(s).},

It automatically extracts structural sequences from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Then, two discriminators are designed to guide the Transformer encoder to learn local and global semantic features of smart contracts. We evaluate SRCL on a dataset of 75,006 smart contracts collected from Etherscan. Experimental results show that SRCL considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art code represen-tation models on three downstream tasks.  © 2022 ACM.},

In the experiment, three smart contracts of the TSPR system are developed using Remix IDE running on an Ethereum test network. A scenario of the events of product traceability and recall in the SC is developed. Two criteria are used to test the validation of contracts: the correct operation and measurement of gas costs. The results show the correctness of three smart contracts, thereby ensuring that the stakeholder chain is provided with visibility and transparency primarily for the product recall process. Moreover, the summation of gas costs deployed in the TSPR system in Ethereum Mainnet for the regulator and manufacturer is 30.23 and 111.54, respectively. However, when using the Polygon Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the gas cost remains 0.022 and 0.083, respectively; thus, this system for stakeholders may help them to achieve lower costs and increased economic worth.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent popularization of distributed ledger technologies, which is better known in the financial sector due to digital currencies, has led to the appearance of numerous applications developed for the blockchain environment. The goal of this research is to investigate how a blockchain can contribute to the reduction of the vulnerabilities to corruption in the Brazilian context. Two stages of a literature review have been performed. The first identified the vulnerabilities to corruption in the Brazilian context and the second one identified the effective uses of blockchain characteristics. Subsequently, a deductive analysis was performed, aiming to verify which of the Blockchain initiatives presented could be potentially applied in the fight against corruption. This study points out ways to mitigate fraud and other causes of corruption to help regain society's trust in state institutions in Brazil, which has been suffering over the years from corruption scandals. Additionally, a research agenda leading to anti-corruption studies has been discussed. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts on Ethereum enable billions of dollars to be transacted in a decentralized, transparent and trustless environment. However, adversaries lie await in the Dark Forest, waiting to exploit any and all smart contract vulnerabilities in order to extract profits from unsuspecting victims in this new financial system. As the blockchain space moves at a breakneck pace, exploits on smart contract vulnerabilities rapidly evolve, and existing research quickly becomes obsolete. It is imperative that smart contract developers stay up to date on the current most damaging vulnerabilities and countermeasures to ensure the security of users' funds, and to collectively ensure the future of Ethereum as a financial settlement layer. This research work focuses on two smart contract vulnerabilities: transaction-ordering dependency and oracle manipulation. Combined, these two vulnerabilities have been exploited to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from smart contracts in the past year (2020-2021). For each of them, this paper presents: (1) a literary survey from recent (as of 2021) formal and informal sources; (2) a reproducible experiment as code demonstrating the vulnerability and, where applicable, countermeasures to mitigate the vulnerability; and (3) analysis and discussion on proposed countermeasures. To conclude, strengths, weaknesses and trade-offs of these countermeasures are summarised, inspiring directions for future research.  © 2021 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {In this study, a new blockchain protocol and a novel architecture that integrate the advantages offered by edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT end-devices, and blockchain were designed, developed, and validated. This new architecture has the ability to monitor the environment, collect data, analyze it, process it using an AI-expert engine, provide predictions and actionable outcomes, and finally share it on a public blockchain platform. For the use-case implementation, the pandemic caused by the wide and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was used to test and evaluate the proposed system. Recently, various authors traced the spread of viruses in sewage water and studied how it can be used as a tracking system. Early warning notifications can allow governments and organizations to take appropriate actions at the earliest stages possible. The system was validated experimentally using 14 Raspberry Pis, and the results and analyses proved that the system is able to utilize low-cost and low-power flexible IoT hardware at the processing layer to detect COVID-19 and predict its spread using the AI engine, with an accuracy of 95%, and share the outcome over the blockchain platform. This is accomplished when the platform is secured by the honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) and without any substantial impact on the devices' power sources, as there was only a power consumption increase of 7% when the Raspberry Pi was used for blockchain mining and 14% when used to produce an AI prediction.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An interesting research problem in the supply chain industry is evaluating and determining the provenance of physical goods—demonstrating the authenticity of luxury goods such as bottled wine. However, many supply chain systems and networks have been built and implemented with centralized system architecture, relying on centralized authorities or any form of intermediary, and leading to issues such as single-point processing, storage and failure, which could be susceptible to malicious modifications to product records or various potential attacks to system components by dishonest participant nodes traversing along the supply chain. Blockchain technology has evolved from merely being a decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger of cryptocurrency transactions to a programmable interactive environment for building decentralized and reliable applications addressing different use-cases and existing problems in the world. In this research, with a chosen research method of proof-by-demonstration, the Decentralized NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting System (dNAS) is proposed and developed, decentralizing a legacy anti-counterfeiting system of the supply-chain industry using Blockchain technology to facilitate trustworthy data provenance retrieval, verification and management, as well as strengthening the capability of the product’s anti-counterfeiting and traceability qualities in the wine industry, with the capacity to further ex-tend this to the supply chain industry as a whole. The proposed dNAS utilizes a decentralized blockchain network with a consensus protocol compatible with the concept of enterprise blockchain, programmable smart contracts and a distributed file storage system to develop a secure and immutable scientific-data provenance tracking and management platform on which provenance records, providing compelling properties of the data integrity of luxurious goods, are recorded, verified and validated automatically. © 2021 by the author.

We develop Ethereum smart contracts to govern and track transactions in a decentralized, transparent, traceable, auditable, trustworthy, and secure manner. This allows overcoming certain issues hindering the transition towards decentralized digital manufacturing and supply, including trusted traceability, attestations, certifications, and secured intellectual property (IP) rights. We incorporate the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) into the Ethereum blockchain to store and fetch Internet of things (IoT)-based devices records and additional manufacturing and supply details. We present the system architecture and algorithms along with their full implementation and testing details. Furthermore, we present cost and security analyses to show that the proposed solution is cost-efficient and resilient against well-known vulnerabilities and security attacks.

As algorithmic stablecoins have been growing rapidly in recent years, they become much more volatile than expected. In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of algorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research questions, i.e., Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they volatile in practice? Specifically, we introduced an in-depth study on three popular types of algorithmic stablecoins and developed a modeling framework to formalize their key design protocols. Through formal verification, the framework can identify critical conditions under which stablecoins might become volatile. Furthermore, we performed a systematic empirical analysis on real transaction activities of the Basis Cash stablecoin to relate theoretical possibilities to market observations. Lastly, we highlighted key design decisions for future development of algorithmic stablecoins. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has attracted broad interests to build decentralised applications. A typical class of applications uses blockchain for the management of cross-organisational business processes as well as assets. However, developing such applications without introducing vulnerabilities is hard for developers, not the least because the deployed code is immutable and can be called by anyone with access to the network. Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps to reduce those risks, by combining proven code snippets as per the model specification, which is easier to understand than source code. Therefore, in this article, we present an approach for integrated MDE across business processes and asset management (e.g., for settlement). Our approach includes methods for fungible/non-fungible asset registration, escrow for conditional payment, and asset swap. The proposed MDE approach is implemented in a smart contract generation tool called Lorikeet, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, functional correctness, and cost effectiveness. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The transfer of market power in electric generation from utilities to end-users spurred by the diffusion of distributed energy resources necessitates a new system of settlement in the electricity business that can better manage generation assets at the grid-edge. A new concept in facilitating distributed generation is peer-to-peer energy trading, where households exchange excess power with neighbors at a price they set themselves. However, little is known about the effects of peer-to-peer energy trading on the sociotechnical dynamics of electric power systems. Further, given the novelty of the concept, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of alternative electricity market structures and individual decision strategies on neighborhood exchanges and market outcomes. This study develops an empirical agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate peer-to-peer electricity trades in a decentralized residential energy market. The framework is applied for a case study in Perth, Western Australia, where a blockchain-enabled energy trading platform was trialed among 18 households, which acted as prosumers or consumers. The ABM is applied for a set of alternative electricity market structures. Results assess the impact of solar generation forecasting approaches, battery energy storage, and ratio of prosumers to consumers on the dynamics of peer-to-peer energy trading systems. Designing an efficient, equitable, and sustainable future energy system hinges on the recognition of trade-offs on and across, social, technological, economic, and environmental levels. Results demonstrate that the ABM can be applied to manage emerging uncertainties by facilitating the testing and development of management strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {As a temporary facility, scaffolding has an essential role in providing a work environment at height in the construction industry. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), approximately 65% of laborers work on scaffolding. Scaffolding work information needs to be effectively managed with reliability to provide a safe environment. However, managing information of the scaffolding work process remains challenging in forgery risk and manual verification. Blockchain has been widely introduced as an accountable and efficient information management solution. This study presents a blockchain-based system for scaffolding work to grant reliability and efficiency of information management. The system is developed to secure applicability by considering three aspects: (1) optimal blockchain platform regarding characteristics of scaffolding work; (2) storage method to address the hindrance of blockchain; (3) information needed to be compared for verifying adequacy. The detailed configuration and process model for the system is categorically presented, and validated via a case study. The case study confirmed that the system was able to store the information in the block smoothly, verify the information using the smart contract successfully, and remain the block size constant by using off-chain. The proposed system has the potential of practical applicability and could contribute to mitigate potential safety risks associated with inadequate scaffolding work management. Furthermore, the proposed system development flow can be leveraged as a guideline to extend blockchain applications to diverse areas in the construction domain.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract, a term which was originally coined to refer to the automation of legal contracts in general, has recently seen much interest due to the advent of blockchain technology. Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited. Our study suggests several directions that researchers and practitioners can work on to help improve developers' experience on developing high-quality smart contracts.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the blockchain, smart contract technology has been widely applied. The number of smart contracts has grown at a high rate and nearly at an average of thousands per day. However, the correctness and security of the smart contract itself are facing huge problems. The well-known DAO vulnerability, and Parity multi-signature wallet’ vulnerabilities have leaded to a hundreds of millions dollars loss, and they are both caused by the security problems of smart contracts. Once the smart contract vulnerability is exploited, it is very likely to bring the loss of cryptocurrencies, the disorder of the financial order and other catastrophic consequences. Therefore the security of smart contracts is imminent. This project has designed and implemented a vulnerability detection system of Ethereum smart contract. The system uses the assembly instruction sequences of the smart contract to generate the control flow graph, then performs symbolic execution and vulnerability constraint solving over the control flow. The system can detect some common types of vulnerabilities, such as the integer overflow and underflow vulnerability, reentry vulnerability and unchecked call return value vulnerability. It has a high accuracy of detection result, and gives support for export vulnerability report. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Information acquisition through crowdsensing with mobile agents is a popular way to collect data, especially in the context of smart cities where the deployment of dedicated data collectors is expensive and ineffective. It requires efficient information elicitation mechanisms to guarantee that the collected data are accurately acquired and reported. Such mechanisms can be implemented via smart contracts on blockchain to enable privacy and trust. In this work we develop Orthos, a blockchain-based trustworthy framework for spontaneous location-based crowdsensing queries without assuming any prior knowledge about them. We employ game-theoretic mechanisms to incentivize agents to report truthfully and ensure that the information is collected at the desired location while ensuring the privacy of the agents. We identify six necessary characteristics for information elicitation mechanisms to be applicable in spontaneous location-based settings and implement an existing state-of-the-art mechanism using smart contracts. Additionally, as location information is exogenous to these mechanisms, we design the Proof-of-Location protocol to ensure that agents gather the data at the desired locations. We examine the performance of Orthos on Rinkeby Ethereum testnet and conduct experiments with live audience. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In the era of paper-based contract, a lot of time, human labor and expenses are required to handle the process of contract drafting, contract signing, contract execution, and payment settlement. The emerging of electronic contract enhances the tedious signing process of paper-based contract and improves the efficiency of contract management. However, due to the centralized system architecture and the database-based storage schema, the stored contract data is at high risk of information leaking, data tampering and hacker attacks. In this study, we introduce Blockchain technology to the contract management, and develop a process-oriented contract management system (BEcontractor) for a Hangzhou-located power grid enterprise X, aiming to solve a series of security issues existing in the traditional electronic contract system. By deploying BEcontractor, procurement activities could be resumed online among X and its nation-widely commodity suppliers during COVID-19 epidemic. Up to September 2020, 6336 electronic contracts have been signed, with an accumulated amount of ¥ 6.5 billion. It is showed that the cost for accomplishing the contract signing process was significantly reduced, and the payment period was shortened from three months to around one month. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh should have owned a decentralized medical record server. We face a lot of issues, such as doctor's appointments, report organization in one spot, and report follow-ups. People now bring a large number of papers to the doctor's chamber. They carry prescriptions, reports, and X-ray files, among other things. It complicates everyone's life as a result. All of the reports must be reviewed by doctors on a regular basis. It is difficult to read old reports on a regular basis, and patients do not receive the correct medications or treatment. Doctors also find it extremely difficult to comprehend handwritten prescriptions. Data security, authenticity, time management, and other areas of data administration are dramatically improved when blockchain (smart contract) technology is linked with standard database management solutions. Blockchain is a groundbreaking, decentralized technology that protects data from unauthorized access. After smart contracts are implemented, the management will be satisfied with the patients. As a result, maintaining data privacy and accountability in the system is tough. It signifies that the information is only accessible to those who have been authenticated. This study focuses on limiting third-party engagement in medical health data and improving data security. Throughout the process, this will improve accessibility and time efficiency. People will feel safer during the payment procedure, which is the most significant benefit. A smart contract and a peer-to-peer encrypted technology were used. The hacker will not be able to gain access to this system since this document uses an immutable ledger. They will not be able to change any of the data if they gain access to the system. If the items are found to be defective, the transaction will be halted. Transaction security will be a viable option for recasting these problems using cryptographic methodologies. We developed a website where patients and doctors will both benefit because of the use of blockchain technology to ensure the security of medical data. We have different profiles for doctors and patients. In the patient profile, they can create their own account by using a unique address, name, and age. This unique address will be created from the genesis block. The unique address is completely private to the owner, who will remain fully secure in our network. After creating an account, the patient can view the doctors' list and they can upload their medical reports such as prescriptions and X-rays. All the records uploaded by the patient will be stored on our local server (Ganache). The records are stored as hashed strings of the data. Those files will also have a unique address, and it will be shown in the patient profile. After granting access, the doctors will be able to view their records in the respective doctor's profile. For accessing the options such as uploading, viewing, or editing the data, Ethereum currency (a fee) will have to be paid in order to complete the request. On the other hand, doctors can enter their profile using their name and unique address. After logging in, they can view their name, unique address, and the list of patients that have granted access to the doctor to view their files. On our website, the front end is handled by JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. The backend is handled by Solidity. Storage is handled by Ganache as the local host. Finally, this paper will show how to ensure that the procedure is as safe as feasible. We are also maintaining transparency and efficiency here.  © 2022 Kazi Tamzid Akhter Md Hasib et al.},

	abstract = {There is a global hype in the development of digital healthcare infrastructure to cater the massive elderly population and infectious diseases. The digital facilitation is expected to ensure the patient privacy, scalability, and data integrity on the sensitive life critical healthcare data, while aligning to the global healthcare data protection standards. The patient data sharing to third parties such as research institutions and universities is also concerned as a significant contribution to the society to sharpen the research and investigations. The emergence of 5G communication technologies eradicates the borders between patients, hospital and other institutions with high end service standards. In patients' perspective, healthcare service delivery through the digital medium is beneficial in terms of time, costs, and risks. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-access Edge Computing(MEC) and blockchain based service architecture utilizing the lightweight ECQV (Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone) certificates for the realtime data privacy, integrity, and authentication between IoT, MEC, and cloud. We further attached storage offloading capability to the blockchain to ensure scalability with a massive number of connected medical devices to the cloud. We introduced a rewarding scheme to the patients and hospitals through the blockchain to encourage data sharing. The access control is handled through the smart contracts. We evaluated the proposed system in a near realistic implementation using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform with Raspberry Pi devices to simulate the activity of the medical sensors. © 2020 IEEE.},

Blockchain technologies already enable the safe and fair exchange of digital assets in a decentralized manner; however, its application to information exchange remains largely unexplored. This article exposes our vision for a semantically-enriched blockchain software ecosystem named ONTOCHAIN, that enables the development of trustworthy distributed applications that can empower users, guarantee both their privacy and high quality of service, and ultimately support pluralism and democracy. ONTOCHAIN aims primarily to attain trustworthy service exchange and trustworthy content handling by means of advanced knowledge management mechanisms for several domains such as health, economy, public services, energy and sustainability, news, media, entertainment, Industry 4.0 and tourism. We present the main components of the ONTOCHAIN architecture and their functionality. Finally, the validity of our approach is exemplified by describing how decentralized applications can be enabled by the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With recent considerable developments in the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of resource-constrained devices are interconnected through the Internet. Monitoring this huge number of IoT devices which are heterogeneous in terms of underlying communication protocols and data format is challenging. The majority of existing IoT device monitoring solutions heavily rely on centralized architectures. Since using centralized architectures comes at the expense of trusting an authority, it has several inherent drawbacks, including vulnerability to security attacks, lack of data privacy, and unauthorized data manipulation. Hence, a new decentralized approach is crucial to remedy these drawbacks. One of the most promising technologies which is widely used to provide decentralization is blockchain. Additionally, to ease the burden of communication overhead and computational power on resource-constrained IoT devices, fog computing can be exploited to decrease communication latency and provide better network scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable blockchain-based architecture for monitoring IoT devices using fog computing. To demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the proposed solution, we have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed solution is significantly scalable and compatible with resource-constrained IoT devices.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain decentralized applications (DApp's) are applications which run on blockchains nodes. Thus, to interact directly with this sort of applications, users need to have a blockchain address, wallet, and knowledge about how to make transactions to interact with DApp's. Therefore, the knowledge required to use a DApp can easily make users to desist when trying to interact with them. To tackle this issue, we propose a software architecture that will be in the middle of the user and the DApp, thus making users initially unaware of the fact that they are interacting with a DApp. This is achieved by analyzing the relationship between DApps and Apps by using UML modelling. Next, based on the previous analysis, we created a middleware for users to interact with a DApp in the same manner they do with a traditional web app, i.e., by using usernames, passwords and user interface elements instead of addresses, private keys or transactions. To put the developed middleware into practice, we developed a DApp that makes use of it. This DApp registers the time control of workers from companies by using blockchain to store the data in a secure and non-modifiable manner. Finally, we performed an experiment, thus demonstrating that a DApp that implements the proposed middleware would improve its usability for users with no experience with blockchain. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to change, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A Contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by contract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the defects and removal priority.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: In the collaborative business environment, blockchain coupled with smart contract removes the reliance on a central system and offers data integrity which is crucial when the transacting parties rely on the shared data. The acceptance of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for the continued use of the services. Despite many extensive studies evaluating the performance of blockchain-based systems, few have focused on users’ acceptance of real-life applications. Objective: The main objective of this research is to evaluate the user acceptance of a real-life blockchain-based system (BBS) by observing various latent variables affecting the development of users’ attitudes and intention to use the system. It also aims to uncover the dimensions and role of trust, security and privacy alongside the primary Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-based predictors and their causal relationship with the users’ behavior to adopt such BBS. Methods: We tested the augmented TAM with Trust Model on a BBS that comprises two subsystems: a Shopping Cart System (SCS), a system oriented towards end-users and a Data Sharing System (DSS), a system oriented towards system administrators. We set research questions and hypotheses, and conducted online surveys by requesting each participant to respond to the questionnaire after using the respective system. The main study comprises two separate sub-studies: the first study was performed on SCS and the second on DSS. Furthermore, each study data comprises initial pre-test and post-test data scores. We analyzed the research model with partial least square structural equation modelling. Results: The empirical study validates our research model and supports most of the research hypotheses. Based on our findings, we deduce that TAM-based predictors and trust constructs cannot be applied uniformly to BBS. Depending on the specifics of the BBS, the relationships between perceived trust antecedents and attitudes towards the system might change. For SCS, trust is the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system, while DSS has perceived privacy as the strongest determinant of attitudes towards system. Quality of system shows the strongest total effect on intention to use SCS, while perceived usefulness has the strongest total effect on intention to use DSS. Trust has a positive significant effect on users’ attitudes towards both BSS, while security does not have any significant effect on users’ attitudes toward BBS. In SCS, privacy positively affects trust, but security has no significant effect on trust, whereas, in DSS, both privacy and security have significant effects on trust. In both BBS, trust has a moderating effect on privacy that correlates with attitudes towards BBS, whereas security does not have any mediating role between privacy and attitudes towards BBS. Hence, we recommend that while developing BBS, particular attention should be paid to increasing user trust and perceived privacy. © Copyright 2021 Shrestha et al.},

	abstract = {Distributed Agile Software Development (DASD) is the most important approach for the modern software industry that allows geographically independent software development. In the past, different tools and frameworks were proposed to solve communication and collaboration issues in DASD but they lacked transparency, trust, traceability, and security. These shortcomings resulted in project failure or overdue, customer dissatisfaction, project deal cancellations, and payment clashes between the customers and development teams. This paper addresses and overcomes the major issues of transparency, trust, security, traceability, coordination, and communication in DASD by embedding blockchain technology. We have proposed a novel blockchain-based framework named as AgilePlus which executes the smart contracts on a private ethereum blockchain for acceptance testing, secure payment, verification of developer's payment requirements, and automatic payment distribution into the digital wallets of development teams. The execution of these smart contracts automatically assign penalties to the customers for late or non-payments and also to the developers for overdue tasks. Moreover, we have also solved the blockchain's scalability challenge in AgilePlus by utilizing Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as off-chain storage. Lastly, experimental results prove that the proposed framework enhances transparency, communication, coordination, traceability, security and solves trust issues of both customers and developers in DASD.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Then, the mean squared error is used as the metric to distinguish the signalling object. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively complete the task.

	abstract = {Security attacks targeting smart contracts have been on the rise, which have led to financial loss and erosion of trust. Therefore, it is important to enable developers to discover security vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. A number of static analysis tools have been developed for finding security bugs in smart contracts. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, there is no systematic approach to evaluate the proposed tools and gauge their effectiveness. This paper proposes SolidiFI, an automated and systematic approach for evaluating smart contracts' static analysis tools. SolidiFI is based on injecting bugs (i.e., code defects) into all potential locations in a smart contract to introduce targeted security vulnerabilities. SolidiFI then checks the generated buggy contract using the static analysis tools, and identifies the bugs that the tools are unable to detect (false-negatives) along with identifying the bugs reported as false-positives. SolidiFI is used to evaluate six widely-used static analysis tools, namely, Oyente, Securify, Mythril, SmartCheck, Manticore and Slither, using a set of 50 contracts injected by 9369 distinct bugs. It finds several instances of bugs that are not detected by the evaluated tools despite their claims of being able to detect such bugs, and all the tools report many false positives. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a developing technology that can be utilized for secure data storage and sharing. In this work, we examine the cost of Blockchain-based data storage for constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We had two phases in the study. In the first phase, we stored data retrieved from a temperature/humidity sensor connected to an Ethereum testnet blockchain using smart contracts in two different ways: first, appending the new data to the existing data, storing all sensor data; and second, overwriting the new data onto the existing data, storing only a recent portion of the data. In the second phase, we stored simulated data from several sensors on the blockchain assuming sensor data is numeric. We proposed a method for encoding the data from the sensors in one variable and compared the costs of storing the data in an array versus storing the encoded data from all sensors in one variable. We also compared the costs of carrying out the encoding within the smart contract versus outside the smart contract. In the first phase, our results indicate that overwriting data points is more cost-efficient than appending them. In the second phase, using the proposed encoding method to store the data from several sensors costs significantly less than storing the data in an array, if the encoding is done outside the smart contract. If the encoding is carried out in the smart contract, the cost is still less than storing the data in an array, however, the difference is not significant. The study shows that even though expensive, for applications where the integrity and transparency of data are crucial, storing IoT sensor data on Ethereum could be a reliable solution. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Despite the high stakes involved in smart contracts, they are often developed in an undisciplined manner, leaving the security and reliability of blockchain transactions at risk. In this article, we introduce ContraMaster - an oracle-supported dynamic exploit generation framework for smart contracts. Existing approaches mutate only single transactions; ContraMaster exceeds these by mutating the transaction sequences. ContraMaster uses data-flow, control-flow, and the dynamic contract state to guide its mutations. It then monitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results against a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities. Being a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is a violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to exploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster has not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types of vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors). We evaluate ContraMaster on 218 vulnerable smart contracts. The experimental results confirm its practical applicability and advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques, and also reveal three new types of attacks.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper studies contractual graphs, where the formation of edges between nodes result in dyadic exchanges. Each dyadic exchange is analyzed as a contractual agreement that is implemented upon fulfilment of underlying conditions. As these dyadic exchanges proliferate, the resulting population of these exchanges creates a contractual graph. A contractual framework for graphs is especially useful in applications where AI-enabled software is employed to create or automate smart contracts between nodes. While some smart contracts may be easily created and executed, others may contain a higher level of ambiguity which may prevent their efficient implementation. Ambiguity in contractual elements is especially difficult to implement, since nodes have to efficiently sense the ambiguity and allocate appropriate amounts of computational resources to the ambiguous contractual task. This paper develops a two-node contractual model of graphs, with varying levels of ambiguity in the contracts and examines its consequences for a market where tasks of differing ambiguity are available to be completed by nodes. The central theme of this paper is that as ambiguity increases, it is difficult for nodes to efficiently commit to the contract since there is an uncertainty in the amount of resources that they have to allocate for completion of the tasks specified in the contract. Thus, while linguistic ambiguity or situational ambiguity might not be cognitively burdensome for humans, it might become expensive for nodes involved in the smart contract. The paper also shows that timing matters—the order in which nodes enter the contract is important as they proceed to sense the ambiguity in a task and then allocate appropriate resources. We propose a game-theoretic formulation to scrutinize how nodes that move first to complete a task are differently impacted than those that move second. We discuss the applications of such a contractual framework for graphs and obtain conditions under which two-node contracts can achieve a successful coalition. Copyright © 2021 Murimi.},

	abstract = {Quality-of-service (QoS) is the term used to evaluate the overall performance of a service. In healthcare applications, efficient computation of QoS is one of the mandatory requirements during the processing of medical records through smart measurement methods. Medical services often involve the transmission of demanding information. Thus, there are stringent requirements for se-cure, intelligent, public-network quality-of-service. This paper contributes to three different aspects. First, we propose a novel metaheuristic approach for medical cost-efficient task schedules, where an intelligent scheduler manages the tasks, such as the rate of service schedule, and lists items uti-lized by users during the data processing and computation through the fog node. Second, the QoS efficient-computation algorithm, which effectively monitors performance according to the indicator (parameter) with the analysis mechanism of quality-of-experience (QoE), has been developed. Third, a framework of blockchain-distributed technology-enabled QoS (QoS-ledger) computation in healthcare applications is proposed in a permissionless public peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which stores medical processed information in a distributed ledger. We have designed and deployed smart contracts for secure medical-data transmission and processing in serverless peering networks and handled overall node-protected interactions and preserved logs in a blockchain distributed ledger. The simulation result shows that QoS is computed on the blockchain public network with transmission power = average of −10 to −17 dBm, jitter = 34 ms, delay = average of 87 to 95 ms, throughput = 185 bytes, duty cycle = 8%, route of delivery and response back variable. Thus, the proposed QoS-ledger is a potential candidate for the computation of quality-of-service that is not limited to e-healthcare distributed applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Online teaching has become mandatory across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic situations. Hence, there is a need to uplift the online teaching technology for data privacy preservation and transparency in the system. Various online teaching schemes have been proposed by various authors, but they lack in handling decentralised governance, transparency, trust and communication issues. Blockchain (BC) Technology has emerged to provide decentralised solution in solving the real-time problems. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we propose a BC-based decentralised online teaching scheme known as BDoTs. The security and data privacy issues in BDoTs are resolved by developing smart contracts (SCs) over BC. Moreover, the data storage cost issues are handled by the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) protocol for Off-Chain data storage. Moreover, we present a real-time BC simulation and deployment of SC in Truffle suite. Results show that the proposed scheme performs better in comparison to the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of scalability, data storage cost, and packet loss.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapidly developing of Internet of Things (IoT), the volume of data generated by IoT systems is increasing quickly. To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts have obtained much attention and are crucial for automatic financial and business transactions. For end-users who have never seen the source code, they can read the user notice shown in end-user client to understand what a transaction does of a smart contract function. However, due to time constraints or lack of motivation, user notice is often missing during the development of smart contracts. For end-users who lack the information of the user notices, there is no easy way for them to check the code semantics of the smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new approach SMARTDOC to generate user notice for smart contract functions automatically. Our tool can help end-users better understand the smart contract and aware of the financial risks, improving the users' confidence on the reliability of the smart contracts. SMARTDOC exploits the Transformer to learn the representation of source code and generates natural language descriptions from the learned representation. We also integrate the Pointer mechanism to copy words from the input source code instead of generating words during the prediction process. We extract 7, 878 〈function, notice〉 pairs from 54, 739 smart contracts written in Solidity. Due to the limited amount of collected smart contract functions (i.e., 7, 878 functions), we exploit a transfer learning technique to utilize the learned knowledge to improve the performance of SMARTDOC. The learned knowledge obtained by the pre-training on a corpus of Java code, that has similar characteristics as Solidity code. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively generate user notice given the source code and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. To investigate human perspectives on our generated user notice, we also conduct a human evaluation and ask participants to score user notice generated by different approaches. Results show that SMARTDOC outperforms baselines from three aspects, naturalness, informativeness, and similarity.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As smart contracts gain adoption in financial transactions, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that they are free of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Of particular relevance in this context are arithmetic overflow bugs, as integers are often used to represent financial assets like account balances. Motivated by this observation, this paper presents SolType, a refinement type system for Solidity that can be used to prevent arithmetic over-and under-flows in smart contracts. SolType allows developers to add refinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations do not lead to over-and under-flows. SolType incorporates a rich vocabulary of refinement terms that allow expressing relationships between integer values and aggregate properties of complex data structures. Furthermore, our implementation, called Solid, incorporates a type inference engine and can automatically infer useful type annotations, including non-Trivial contract invariants. To evaluate the usefulness of our type system, we use Solid to prove arithmetic safety of a total of 120 smart contracts. When used in its fully automated mode (i.e., using Solid's type inference capabilities), Solid is able to eliminate 86.3% of redundant runtime checks used to guard against overflows. We also compare Solid against a state-of-The-Art arithmetic safety verifier called VeriSmart and show that Solid has a significantly lower false positive rate, while being significantly faster in terms of verification time. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {Information sharing is essential for coordination and stakeholder integration and is crucial to achieving sustainable supply chain operations. Furthermore, improved information sharing assists retailers by reducing the time spent looking for alternative suppliers to meet the unexpected demand surge during pandemics. Recent advances in networking and distributed ledger technologies have enabled secure, improved information communication and broader connectivity. However, due to system interoperability, information quality, confidentiality, and trust, information cannot be exchanged seamlessly, resulting in the inefficiency of managing supply chain operations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based inventory sharing approach based on smart contracts using a private Ethereum network to link suppliers and retailers. Our approach combines blockchain technology with decentralized storage to increase transparency, trust, and security of supply chain transactions. We present a generalized mechanism for secure information sharing that includes comprehensive algorithms to capture supply chain stakeholder interactions that enhance trust among participating entities. The smart contract was developed and validated using the Remix IDE, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We analyze the solution for various security vulnerabilities and provide a detailed cost analysis for various stakeholder transactions in the supply chain. Our solution demonstrates that a blockchain-based approach reduces inefficiencies, is economical, commercially viable, and provides improved information connectivity among supply chain stakeholders in a trusted and secure way.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Our solution can be deployed in such a way that no human intervention is required to reach this type of agreement.

	abstract = {The world is moving rapidly from carbon-producing vehicles to green transportation systems. Electric vehicles (EV) are a big step towards a friendly mode of transport. With the constant rise in the number of electric vehicles, we need a widespread and seamless charging infrastructure that supports seamless charging and billing. Some users generate electricity using solar panels and charge their electric vehicles. In contrast, some use charging stations, and they pay for vehicle charging. This raises the question of trust and transparency. There are many countries where laws are not strictly enforced to prevent fraud in payment systems. One of the preeminent problems presently existing with any of the trading systems is the lack of transparency. The service provider can overcharge the customer. Blockchain is a modern-day solution that mitigates trust and privacy issues. We have proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading and charging payment system for electric vehicles based on blockchain technology. Users who have excess electricity which they can sell to the charging stations through smart contracts. Electric vehicle users can pay the charging bills through electronic wallets. We have developed the electric vehicle’s automatic-payment system using the open-source platform Hyperledger fabric. The proposed system will reduce human interaction and increase trust, transparency, and privacy among EV participants. We have analyzed the resource utilization and also performed average transaction latency and throughput evaluation.

	abstract = {With the gradual popularization of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and the development of wireless networking technologies, the use of heterogeneous devices and runtime verification of task fulfillment with different constraints are required in real-world IoT scenarios. As far as IoT systems are concerned, most of them are built on centralized architectures, which reveal various assailable points in data security and privacy threats. Hence, this paper aims to investigate these issues by delegating the responsibility of a verification monitor from a centralized architecture to a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. We present a smart contract-based task management scheme to provide runtime verification of device behaviors and allows trustworthy access control to these devices. The business logic of the proposed system is specified by the smart contract, which automates all time-consuming processes cryptographically and correctly. The usability of the proposed solution is further demonstrated by implementing a prototype application in which the Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to implement the business logic for runtime verification and access control with one desktop and one Raspberry Pi. A comprehensive evaluation experiment is conducted, and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Progressively, Software development organizations are investing their resources, time and, money on Software Process Improvement (SPI) since it is beneficial in the enhancement of product quality, reduction in development time, and cost of software projects. However, the existing methodologies and approaches are time-consuming and costly and their major focus is on the SPI of Large Scale Enterprises (LSEs) therefore, we are introducing blockchain in SPI to overcome its major issues such as reliance on a central body of standardization for certification, knowledge management, high cost, resource management and change in organizational culture, etc. We have performed an exploratory case study to identify the different barriers of traditional SPI approaches. To overcome the identified issues, we have proposed and implemented a new approach by performing two case studies. The first case study was performed to identify the barriers in traditional SPI approaches and the second case study was performed to validate our proposed approach. We have performed our experiments on 55 representatives of 50 organizations. According to the results of proposed approach 56.4% of the population agreed that the SPI cost will decrease, 61.8% agreed that time of SPI will decrease and 60.3% of the population agreed that BBSPI will decrease resource utilization. Moreover, 69.1% of the population agreed with the fact that proposed BBSPI will make effective knowledge management and 83.3% of the population said that an organization can mature its processes equaliant to the central certification (CMMI, ISO) body by employing proposed BBSPI. Our results affirm that the BBSPI can reduce the time, cost, resources and helps to manage knowledge used to perform SPI. Moreover, results also depict that the BBSPI can be an efficient substitute of central bodies that could help small and medium-sized organizations to conform to common process improvement models by spending less money, time, and resources with effective knowledge management. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and overall scheme for the use and management of building information modeling (BIM) in the whole building life cycle, especially the use of BIM technology for asset management and facility management. However, there is little understanding and implementation of enterprise BIM. BIM influences and changes the new project management mode of the whole life cycle of construction projects from design to construction. The safety, audit, responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of building information, responsibility traceability and customer satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the aspects of design technology, construction management, material scheduling and whole life cycle construction.

	abstract = {The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work’s main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The roll-out of 5G technology will nurture the realization of broadband, ultra-reliable, and zero latency services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) are among the key enablers for 5G. The synergy between NFV and MEC allows migration of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) from cloud to the edge of the network thereby adding agility to the softwarized 5G networks. The overall orchestration of VNF includes, but is not limited to, processing VNF requests, selecting appropriate VNF, migrating VNF from cloud to MEC, instantiating migrated VNF at MEC, settling payment according to a VNF's usage, maintaining VNF's reputation, etc. The orchestration is not foolproof and raises doubts about its trustworthiness. To address all the existing issues in a unified manner, we leverage Blockchain technology as yet another enabling technology for MEC-enabled 5G. Thus, we propose a Blockchain-enhanced architecture for secure VNF orchestration such that issues like authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, reputation, payment transfer, and many more are resolved. To furnish a Proof-of-Concept (PoC), we develop a prototypical DApp (Decentralized Application) using Ethereum Blockchain and Suricata as an exemplar VNF. Further, we discuss the strong resiliency of the proposed architecture against numerous well-known attacks.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) arises as an innovative paradigm for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications to build cooperative trust, aggregate wireless resources, and schedule inter-and intra-network tasks among independent network entities. It establishes an open platform based on blockchain to provide diverse wireless services and applications, such as radio access, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile edge computing, via trusted interactions with enhanced security and efficiency. As a distinctive feature, B-RAN enables secure and efficient resource sharing and trading by aggregating, pooling, and coordinating resources from multiple resource hosts and owners across subnetworks. Therefore, an implementable architecture along with various functional modules shall be delicately designed. This work aims to establish a unified architecture with enhanced efficiency, security, compatibility, and flexibility for resource sharing and trading in B-RAN. Specifically, we develop a six-layer architecture that incorporates a number of novel features such as enhanced blockchain structures, secure interaction methods, efficient service mechanisms, and scalable transaction patterns. We design a number of pluggable functional modules in each layer to support diverse functions, services, and applications of resource sharing and trading. At last, we implement a practical prototype based on the layered architecture for resource-limited devices. Multiple experiments are presented to verify the performance of the proposed architecture from different aspects. IEEE},

However, developing smart contracts is non-trivial and challenging due to the lack of tools and expertise in this field. A promising solution to overcome this issue is to use Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), however, using models still involves a learning curve and might not be suitable for non-technical users. To tackle this challenge, chatbot or conversational interfaces can be used to assess the non-technical users to specify a smart contract in gradual and interactive manner. In this paper, we propose iContractBot, a chatbot for modeling and developing smart contracts. Moreover, we investigate how to integrate iContractBot with iContractML, a domainspecific modeling language for developing smart contracts, and instantiate intention models from the chatbot. The iContractBot framework provides a domain-specific language (DSL) based on the user intention and performs model-to-text transformation to generate the smart contract code. A smart contract use case is presented to demonstrate how iContractBot can be utilized for creating models and generating the deployment artifacts for smart contracts based on a simple conversation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been developed to enhance the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The perpetual script of a smart contract, that executes an agreement machine-to-machine without prejudice, guarantees performance of ‘contractual terms’ enabling the exchange or transaction of cryptoassets and other forms of property. Yet, smart contracts as recognisable or valid legal instruments within the boundaries of contract or property law remain uncertain and contentious. Contrary to perceptions of contractual streamlining and efficiency, understanding the uncertainty smart contracts produce lies in the technology's failure to meet many of the fundamental principles of contract law and theory concerning, for example, breach of promise and remedy for breach. Smart contracts appear to reduce contracting to a form and standard well below that developed by contract law and theory over many centuries in both civil and common law jurisdictions. Including elements of the law of restitution, this article's remedial analysis will examine smart contracts considering ‘traditional’ contract law to understand and, where possible, test the legal legitimacy of this post-human technology, and explore the potential of smart contracts to supplement or, in time, supersede traditional contract law. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {ERC20 token is the most popular type of Ethereum smart contract. The daily transaction volume of these tokens exceeds 100 billion dollars, which agitates the popular notions of “decentralized banking” and “tokenized economy”. Yet, it is a common misconception to assume that the decentralization of blockchain entails the decentralization of smart contracts deployed on this blockchain. In practice, the developers of smart contracts implement administrating patterns, such as censoring certain users, creating or destroying balances on demand, destroying smart contracts, or injecting arbitrary code. These routines, which are designed to tightly control the operation of these smart contracts, turn an ERC20 token into an administrated token—the type of Ethereum smart contract that we scrutinize in this research. We discover that many smart contracts are administrated, which means that their owners solely possess an omnipotent power over these contracts. Moreover, the owners of these tokens carry lesser social and legal responsibilities compared to the traditional centralized actors that those tokens intend to disrupt. This entails two major problems: a) the owners of the tokens have the ability to quickly steal all the funds and disappear from the market; and b) if the private key of the owner’s account is stolen, all the assets might immediately turn into the property of the attacker. Therefore, the administrated ERC20 tokens are not only dissimilar to the traditional centralized asset management tools, such as banks, but they are also more vulnerable to adversarial actions by their owners or attackers. We develop a pattern recognition framework based on 9 syntactic features characterizing administrated ERC20 tokens, which we use to analyze existing smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Our analysis of 84,062 unique Ethereum smart contracts reveals that nearly 58% of them are administrated ERC20 tokens, which accounts for almost 90% of all ERC20 tokens deployed on Ethereum. To protect users from the frivolousness of unregulated token owners without depriving the ability of these owners to properly manage their tokens, we introduce SafelyAdministrated—a library that enforces a responsible ownership and management of ERC20 tokens. The library introduces three mechanisms: deferred maintenance, board of trustees and safe pause. We implement and test SafelyAdministrated in the form of Solidity abstract contract, which is ready to be used by the next generation of safely administrated ERC20 tokens. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {By law, schools are required to protect the well-being of students against problems such as on-campus bullying and physical abuse. In the UK, a report by the Office for Education (OfE) showed 17% of young people had been bullied during 2017–2018. This problem continues to prevail with consequences including depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders. Additionally, recent evidence suggests this type of victimisation could intensify existing health complications. This study investigates the opportunities provided by Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data towards next-generation safeguarding. A new model is developed based on blockchain technology to enable real-time intervention triggered by IoMT data that can be used to detect stressful events, e.g., when bullying takes place. The model utilises private permissioned blockchain to manage IoMT data to achieve quicker and better decision-making while revolutionising aspects related to compliance, double-entry, confidentiality, and privacy. The feasibility of the model and the interaction between the sensors and the blockchain was simulated. To facilitate a close approximation of an actual IoMT environment, we clustered and decomposed existing medical sensors to their attributes, including their function, for a variety of scenarios. Then, we demonstrated the performance and capabilities of the emulator under different loads of sensor-generated data. We argue to the suitability of this emulator for schools and medical centres to conduct feasibility studies to address sensor data with disruptive data processing and management technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {—Due to the increasing complexity of supply chains over the past years, many factors significantly contribute to lowering the supply chains performance. Poor visibility is one of the major challenging factors that lowers supply chains performance. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based supply chain network model to improve the supply chain visibility. The model focuses in improving the visibility measurements properties: information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility. The proposed model consists of information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility platforms based on Blockchain technology smart contract. The model built with Hyperledger platform and extend the Hyperledger Composer Supply Chain Network (HCSC) model. The research is designed to three main phases. First phase: the preliminary phase which is the literature review phase to identify the existing challenges in the domain. The second phase: the design and implementation phase which is the development steps of the proposed research model. The third phase: the evaluation phase which represent the performance evaluation of the proposed model and the comparisons between the proposed model and the existing models. In the evaluation performance, the common performance metrics Lead time and average inventory levels will be compared in the proposed model, Cloud-based information system, and the traditional supply chain. These proposed platforms offer an end-to-end visibility of products, orders, and stock levels for supply chain practitioners and customers within supply chain networks. Which helps managers’ access key information that support critical business decisions and offers essential criteria for competitiveness and therefore, enhance supply chain performance. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the lives of millions of people worldwide. With an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases, it is important to detect and diagnose COVID-19 in its early stages to prevent its spread. To diagnose remote patients, the Internet can be useful for accessing data of that patient. But, the Internet has also had issues related to data security, reliability, and privacy. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain (BC) based COVID-19 detection scheme (BCovX) for fast and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. For fast and accurate detection of COVID-19 using CXR, BCovX consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using which a patient can be diagnosed for COVID-19 remotely. CNNs have performed successfully in medical imaging classification. BCovX provides reliable and secure data access and exchange using BC and smart contracts (SC). To solve issues related to data storage and its associated cost, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol is used to store medical data. We also present a real-time SC developed in Solidity to govern the transaction between the patient and the doctor. The SC has been compiled and deployed on Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Finally, we have evaluated the performance of BCovX with traditional schemes in terms of storage cost, bandwidth requirements, and accuracy of the CNN model. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of blockchain technologies, many Ponzi schemes disguise them-selves under the veil of smart contracts. The Ponzi scheme contracts cause serious financial losses, which has a bad effect on the blockchain. Existing Ponzi scheme contract detection studies have mainly focused on extracting hand-crafted features and training a machine learning classifier to detect Ponzi scheme contracts. However, the hand-crafted features cannot capture the structural and semantic feature of the source code. Therefore, in this study, we propose a Ponzi scheme contract detection method called MTCformer (Multi-channel Text Convolutional Neural Networks and Transofrmer). In order to reserve the structural information of the source code, the MTCformer first converts the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the smart contract code to the specially formatted code token sequence via the Structure-Based Traversal (SBT) method. Then, the MTCformer uses multi-channel TextCNN (Text Convolutional Neural Networks) to learn local structural and semantic features from the code token sequence. Next, the MTCformer employs the Transformer to capture the long-range dependencies of code tokens. Finally, a fully connected neural network with a cost-sensitive loss function in the MTCformer is used for classification. The experimental results show that the MTCformer is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and its variants in Ponzi scheme contract detection. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has become a hot topic in various industries. With the development and maturity of blockchain technology, it has been applied to finance, law, etc., with its advantages of decentralization, openness, information security, and concealment. The application scenarios of industry are becoming more and more abundant. Compared with the traditional TPA payment contract form, the smart contract mechanism based on blockchain technology is obviously more efficient, convenient, and safe. Against this background, we design a smart payment contract suitable for cloud storage by studying Ethereum. The relationship clause in the smart payment contract should be regulated around the contract law. The smart contract payment linkage clause can be classified into three forms, including conditional effective type, contract joint type, and contract link type, which correspond to the contract law. Therefore, the contract legal system for smart contract payment linkage clauses should follow typified thinking. Based on blockchain technology, smart contracts not only reduce the number of interactions in contract execution but also allow users to stop paying for cloud services when data is lost or damaged. The precise method is to generate each node with a private chain and place the smart contract on the private chain. With the decentralization of the blockchain private chain, the advantages of read-only data, and traceability of information, the storage of smart payment contract data is more secure. Both parties to the transaction are more trustworthy. Therefore, the proposed system has a safe and efficient smart contract payment mechanism, which brings a good user experience to users, which proves the significance and value of this research.  © 2021 Xianyun Ge.},

	abstract = {To mitigate the scalability problem of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the payment channel, which allows two parties to perform secure coin transfers without involving the blockchain, has been proposed. The payment channel increases the transaction throughput of two parties to a level that is only limited by their network bandwidth. Recent proposals focus on extending the two-party payment channel to the N-party payment hub. Unfortunately, none of them can achieve efficiency, flexibility in the absence of a trusted third-party. In this paper, we propose Garou, a secure N-party payment hub that allows multiple parties to perform secure off-chain coin transfers. Except in the case of disputes, participants within the payment hub can make concurrent and direct coin transfers with each other without the involvement of the blockchain or any third-party intermediaries. This allows Garou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. If all participants keep online, Garou guarantees all honest users' balance security against strong adversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol, we develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network. Experimental evaluations show that, with 300 participants and without disputes, that the maximum transaction throughput of Garou is 20× higher than that of state-of-the-art payment hubs. © 2021 IEEE.},

The low cost of access and fast spread speed greatly enriches people's spiritual life, but it also poses great challenges to the protection of intellectual property rights. Nowadays, although the intellectual property rights of music works have been better valued and protected, there are still some problems that limit the development of the music industry and affect the users' experience. For example, the copyrights of different music works may be exclusively represented by different companies, resulting in limited choices for users and vicious competition among music operating companies, which affects the users' experience and is not conducive to the long-term development of the music industry. In order to solve the above problems, we present a decentralized music copyright operation management system based on Blockchain technology. By using the Blockchain's shared ledger mechanism and smart contracts as the basic framework of the Ethereum platform, we realize decentralized music copyright management. The system not only protects copyright better, but also coordinates the interests of creators, copyright owners, operators and users, which is beneficial to the further development of the music industry, and creates more value and better experience for users. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {Smart Contracts are software programs that are deployed and executed within a blockchain infrastructure. Due to their immutable nature, directly resulting from the specific characteristics of the deploying infrastructure, smart contracts must be thoroughly tested before their release. Testing is one of the main activities that can help to improve the reliability of a smart contract, so as to possibly prevent considerable loss of valuable assets. It is therefore important to provide the testers with tools that permit them to assess the activity they performed.Mutation testing is a powerful approach for assessing the fault-detection capability of a test suite. In this paper, we propose SuMo, a novel mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts. SuMo implements a set of 44 mutation operators that were designed starting from the latest Solidity documentation, and from well-known mutation testing tools. These allow to simulate a wide variety of faults that can be made by smart contract developers. The set of operators was designed to limit the generation of stillborn mutants, which slow down the mutation testing process and limit the usability of the tool. We report a first evaluation of SuMo on open-source projects for which test suites were available. The results we got are encouraging, and they suggest that SuMo can effectively help developers to deliver more reliable smart contracts. © 2021 IEEE.},

To protect participants who have no constant access to the blockchain, a watching service named as watchtower is proposed - a third-party entity obligated to monitor channel states (on behalf of the participants) and correct them on-chain if necessary. Unfortunately, currently proposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We propose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to prior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch on-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain message periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being closed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are privacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors. Furthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option economically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a simple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate misbehaving parties in these scenarios.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Controlled drugs are open to abuse, misuse, and diversion. Therefore, they are regulated and tracked across the healthcare sector to protect the health of the general public which is a highly prioritized rule in the health professional's code of ethics. Healthcare centers that provide controlled medication to patients are still using manual papers to record controlled drugs production, delivery, prescription, administration, and disposal which causes delays in the system. Moreover, instances of controlled drugs misuse, abuse, and diversion still exist, which shows how the currently used system is inefficient in detecting such activities. Therefore, to ensure that the public health is safe and secure, an end-to-end system that tracks the whole healthcare supply chain is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a private Ethereum blockchain-based solution for the management of controlled medication. We ensure transparency, accountability, security, and data provenance by developing smart contracts that record all actions on an immutable ledger. We utilize off-chain storage, which is represented in the IPFS to store content that is large in size such as images. We present algorithms of the different phases in the proposed solution to illustrate how each phase will be carried out. We showcase the functionality of the proposed solution by performing tests and validating the smart contracts. We assess the performance of the proposed solution by conducting privacy, security, and confidentiality analysis. Performance evaluation shows that our solution is secure against common attacks and vulnerabilities and preserves the privacy and confidentiality of the patients.

	abstract = {A smart contract is the algorithmic description of a contractual transaction protocol that is automatically executed together with the information provided by its parties. It is written in a simplified programming language that is specific to a particular domain. Not only correctness and unambiguity are its essential formal properties, but also conformance to any legislation governing the matter of the transaction. Finally, and importantly, the trustworthiness, safety and security of the platform executing the transactions are its main attributes. An emerging challenge is to define a proper engineering process to meet the demanding requirements while supporting mass production and distribution. This paper proposes the concept of smart contract engineering (SCE) to facilitate the generation of smart legal contracts, which is the combination of software engineering, formal methods and computational law. SCE aims to reduce the potential errors and improve efficiency during the contract development process, meanwhile promote the standardization of contract design methodologies. In this paper, the roadmap of an iterative refinement-based, model-driven formal design methodology is introduced, not only to validate smart contracts but also to support the whole life cycle of their engineering. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain is an innovative technology that disrupts different industries and offers decentralized, secure, and immutable platforms. Its first appearance is connected with monetary cryptocurrency transactions, followed by adaptation in several domains. We believe that blockchain can provide a reliable environment by utilizing its unique characteristics to offer a more secure, costless, and robust mechanism suitable for a voting application. Although the technology has captured the interest of governments worldwide, blockchain as a service is still limited due to lack of application development experience, technology complexity, and absence of standardized design, architecture, and best practices. Therefore, this study aims to build an imperial example for a blockchain electronic voting (e-voting) application using digital identity management for fulfilling immutable, transparent, and secure distributed blockchain features. The paper reviews the current types of e-voting systems and discusses the standard processes. We propose a conceptual design for a blockchain providing a digital identity management service to secure the e-voting application results. The blockchain development process implemented in this study follows the Proof of Concept to verify the e-voting application’s function for illustrating the architecture and description of the application’s business process model. The development is based on the Ethereum platform, which allows the implementation of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. The developed e-voting application saves time, requires fewer processes, and results in higher accuracy, more transparency, considerable voters’ privacy, and accountable system management. We expect that the e-voting blockchain application will impact governmental processes during the election, reduce spending, support digital transformation, and ensure fairness of results. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Invoice factoring is a handy tool for developing businesses that face liquidity problems. The main property that a factoring system needs to fulfill is to prevent an invoice from being factored twice. Distributed ledger technology is suitable for implementing the platform to register invoice factoring agreements and prevent double-factoring. Several works have been proposed to use this technology for invoice factoring. However, current proposals lack in one or several aspects, such as decentralization and security against corruption, protecting business and personally identifiable information (PII), providing non-repudiation for handling disputes, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance, easy user on-boarding, and being cost-efficient. In this article, a factoring registration protocol is proposed for invoice factoring registration based on a public distributed ledger which adheres to the aforementioned requirements. We include a relayer in our architecture to address the entry barrier that the users have due to the need of managing cryptocurrencies for interacting with the public ledger. Moreover, we leverage the concept of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for KYC compliance, and allow parties to implement their self-sovereign identities by using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). DIDs enable us to relay on the DIDComm protocol for asynchronous and secure off-chain communications. We analyze our protocol from several security aspects, compare it to the related work, and study a possible business use case. Our evaluations demonstrate that our proposal is secure and efficient, as well as covers requirements not addressed by existing related work. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

	abstract = {With the development of Internet of things, more and more objects are connected to the Internet. It will lead to data leakage caused by arbitrary access easily. Thus, an effective method to prevent data leakage is needed. Traditional access control schemes include role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and capability-based access control (CapBAC) are all using a central or a third trusted party to manage user information, which is prone to single failure. In order to solve the problems, in this paper, a fine-grained access control scheme based on blockchain technology named SFAC is proposed. In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely studied and applied in various fields. It has the advantages of decentralization, imitation tampering, and traceability, and is a distributed public ledger. Therefore, combined with blockchain, SFAC can not only solve the problem of centralization, but also allow users to request resources in batches, and uses token mechanism to facilitate users' requests. After the user gets a token, it can directly use the token to revoke resources. Besides, we use a smart contract to implement our proposed scheme and carrying out a series of experiments on the test network of Ethereum. The experimental results show that our SAFC is feasible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many decentralized applications based on blockchain (DApp) have been developed. Some development tools provide testing functions, but only for developers to write unit tests for smart contracts rather than test DApp as a whole. Moreover, due to the difficulty for testers to understand the implementation details of smart contracts, insufficient functional testing causes some DApps not to meet functional design expectations. The inherent complexity of DApp, inconvenient pre-state setting, and not-so-readable logs make DApp testing challenging. In this paper, we propose Kaya, a testing framework for DApps to bridge these gaps. Firstly, Kaya formulate automatically executed test cases that cover both front-end behaviors and back-end logics with simple setting. Secondly, Kaya provides a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set the blockchain pre-states. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible addresses into readable variables for easier comprehension. Besides, to fit the various application environments, we provide both GUI and CLI for test engineers to use Kaya. Our case study and preliminary human study demonstrates the potential of Kaya in helping test engineers to test DApps more easily. A demo video is at https://youtu.be/7DyI_EpVZFw. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology, which provides digital security in a distributed manner, has evolved into a key technology that can build efficient and reliable decentralized applications (called DApps) beyond the function of cryptocurrency. The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the novel paradigm of connectivity and the driving force behind state-of-the-art applications and services. However, the exponential growth of the number of IoT devices and services, their distributed nature, and scarcity of resources has increased the number of security and privacy concerns ranging from the risks of unauthorized data alterations to the potential discrimination enabled by data analytics over sensitive information. Thus, a blockchain based IoT-platform is introduced to address these issues. Built upon the tamper-proof architecture, the proposed access management mechanisms ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Moreover, a novel approach called Block Analytics Tool (BAT), integrated with the platform is proposed to analyze and make predictions on data stored on the blockchain. BAT enables the data-analysis applications to be developed using the data stored in the platform in an optimized manner acting as an interface to off-chain processing. A pharmaceutical supply chain is used as the use case scenario to show the functionality of the proposed platform. Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand of the pharmaceutical drugs is investigated using a real-world data set to demonstrate the functionality of BAT. Finally, the performance of BAT integrated with the platform is evaluated. c© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, ML models that are trained on sensitive data tend to leak privacy to adversarial attacks, limiting its full potential in Industry 4.0. This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer.

How to improve the applicability and scientific nature of electric vehicle charging is an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes an intelligent scheduling access model for electric vehicles based on blockchain. Firstly, the layout simplification calculation is carried out for the layout of the traditional distributed power grid. Then, a data storage and consensus system is built using blockchain smart contracts to ensure that all historical data are not tampered with and are traceable. Finally, the model forms an electricity price guidance model in the intelligent scheduling and access of electric vehicles, optimizes the multivehicle line congestion in operation, and can dynamically schedule and correct the model. In terms of the experiment, 13 test electric vehicles were dispatched based on 12 real power station nodes and 36 test nodes of Yunnan Power Grid Co. Information Center for verification. The result analysis shows that the model can effectively and quickly solve the blocking and unblocking of the Internet of Vehicles and can develop a scheduling scheme conforming to the safety constraints of electric vehicles in a relatively short time.  © 2021 Cheng Xu et al.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved the high-accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms in long-standing AI tasks. Due to the obvious privacy issues of deep learning, Google proposes Federal Deep Learning (FDL), in which distributed participants only upload local gradients and and a centralized server updates parameters based on the collected gradients. But few users are willing to participate in federated learning due to the lack of contribution evaluation and reward mechanisms. So a decentralized federated deep learning, called DFDL, has been proposed by introducing blockchain to form an effective incentive mechanism for participants. However, DFDL still faces serious privacy issues as blockchain does not guarantee the privacy of training data and model. In this paper, in order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a new Privacy-preserving DFDL scheme, called PDFDL. With PDFDL, parties can securely learn a global model with their local gradients in the assistance of blockchain, and the parties' sensitive data and the global model are well protected. Specifically, with a secure multi-party aggregation computing, all local gradients are encrypted by their owners before being sent to the smart contract, and can be directly aggregated without decryption. Detailed security analysis shows that PDFDL can resist various known security threats. Moreover, we give an implementation prototype by integrating deep learning module with a Blockchain development platform (Ethereum V1.6.4). We demonstrate the encryption performance and the training accuracy of our PDFDL on benchmark datasets. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Ethereum holds multiple billions of U.S. dollars in the form of Ether cryptocurrency and ERC-20 tokens, with millions of deployed smart contracts algorithmically operating these funds. Unsurprisingly, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has been under rigorous scrutiny. In recent years, numerous defense tools have been developed to detect different types of smart contract code vulnerabilities. When opportunities for exploiting code vulnerabilities diminish, the attackers start resorting to social engineering attacks, which aim to influence humans-often the weakest link in the system. The only known class of social engineering attacks in Ethereum are honeypots, which plant hidden traps for attackers attempting to exploit existing vulnerabilities, thereby targeting only a small population of potential victims. In this work, we explore the possibility and existence of new social engineering attacks beyond smart contract honeypots. We present two novel classes of Ethereum social engineering attacks-Address Manipulation and Homograph-and develop six zero-day social engineering attacks. To show how the attacks can be used in popular programming patterns, we conduct a case study of five popular smart contracts with combined market capitalization exceeding $29 billion, and integrate our attack patterns in their source codes without altering their existing functionality. Moreover, we show that these attacks remain dormant during the test phase but activate their malicious logic only at the final production deployment. We further analyze 85,656 open-source smart contracts, and discover that 1,027 of them can be used for the proposed social engineering attacks. We conduct a professional opinion survey with experts from seven smart contract auditing firms, corroborating that the exposed social engineering attacks bring a major threat to the smart contract systems. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the financial services industry, many people assume blockchain to have significant impacts. From research and practice, we observe two main paradigms of how organizations interact with blockchain. First, organizations use blockchain to optimize existing processes (blockchain-based business process optimization (BPO)). Second, organizations use blockchain to disrupt existing processes, foster disintermediation, and enable disruptive business models (blockchain-based business process disruption (BPD)). However, we lack scientific research that evaluates its de facto potential. We bridge this gap by following a design science research approach to design blockchain-based business process re-engineering (BPRE) for a letter of credit that combines the advantages of BPO and BPD. We conduct three design cycles and develop three artefacts: a BPO, a BPD, and a BPRE approach. Our BPRE approach combines the advantages of partial disintermediation (i.e., increased efficiency and transparency) with the advantages of intermediaries (i.e., process flexibility, liquidity provision, and dispute mediation). © 2021 by the Association for Information Systems.},

	abstract = {The journey towards Industry 4.0 have driven the workforce with the need for continuous competency development to stay on top of their profession and remain attractive to their employers. In this context, E-Portfolio has been conceived as a promising tool for both professionals and employers, in assessing and providing guidance for further workplace learning. Nevertheless, the challenges in implementing E-Portfolio are daunting, particularly with regard to lack of interoperability while collecting and sharing the competency evidences across multiple organizations and institutions. The increasing move towards professional (learner)-centered interoperability poses additional challenges that needs to be addressed to realize the full potential of E-Portfolio in the context of Industry 4.0. This work puts emphasize on realization of professional-centered interoperability and proposes a framework leveraging the advantage of blockchain, decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, smart contract and session management for E-Portfolio creation and sharing evidences across multiple organizations without comprising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the shared evidences. The proof of concept simulation on Ethereum official test network Rinkeby demonstrates the feasibility of proposed framework in practice. In addition, the evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness from the aspects of cost and security as a potential solution for implementing E-Portfolio and helping the professional to remain competitive in global labor market. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing a feasible solution for storing and exchanging medical images in the field of health care. Current practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which increase maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy concerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important to design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data efficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a novel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image management (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient private data without using a centralized infrastructure. In this system, we employed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system technology called Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an Ethereum smart contract called the patient-centric access control protocol to enable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the means for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility. We describe how the PCIM system architecture facilitates the distributed and secured patient-centric data access across multiple entities such as hospitals, patients, and image requestors. Finally, we deployed a smart contract prototype on an Ethereum testnet blockchain and evaluated the proposed framework within the Windows environment. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Data sharing among distributed medical institutions is already a development trend. However, the security is worrying; e.g., the access to medical data lacks uniformity and standardization. What is more, data is easy to be tampered with and leaked. This has a very negative impact on the medical industry. Therefore, a strict and reliable access control mechanism for data in the medical cyber physical systems is a prerequisite for ensuring the implementation of modern medical functions. We deal with how to design effective access control in medical cyber physical systems. Combined with blockchain technology, we design the medical cyber physical systems based on blockchain data access control mechanism and unite data in the chain of union Fabric network resources access control. We qualitatively classify medical data, define the weight level of different data, design a medical data access framework based on blockchain, build an applicable model, formulate access control strategy, and specify the role assignment and access task matching of users, so as to achieve secure and effective data access control. The Hyperledger Fabric network is established as the alliance chain for managing access control rights distribution through smart contracts so as to achieve case-based medical data access control under the blockchain.  © 2021 Fulong Chen et al.},

	abstract = {6G is anticipated to become more human-centered than 5G and should not only explore more spectrum at high-frequency bands but, more importantly, converge driving technological trends such as blockchain technologies and connected robotics. This paper focuses on the emerging field of robonomics, which studies the sociotechnical impact of blockchain technologies on social human-robot interaction and behavioral economics for the social integration of robots into human society. Advanced blockchain technologies such as oracles enable the on-chaining of blockchain-external off-chain information stemming from human users. In doing so, they leverage on human intelligence rather than machine learning only. In this paper, we investigate the widely studied trust game of behavioral economics in a blockchain context, paying close attention to the importance of developing efficient cooperation and coordination technologies. After identifying open research challenges of blockchain-enabled implementations of the trust game, we first develop a smart contract that replaces the experimenter in the middle between trustor and trustee and demonstrate experimentally that a social efficiency of up to 100% can be achieved by using deposits to enhance both trust and trustworthiness. We then present an on-chaining oracle architecture for a networked $N$ -player trust game that involves a third type of human agents called observers, who track the players' investment and reciprocity. The presence of third-party reward and penalty decisions helps raise the average normalized reciprocity above 80%, even without requiring any deposit. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that mixed logical-affective persuasive strategies for social robots improve the trustees' trustworthiness and reciprocity significantly.  © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the classical consensus method of blockchain, that is, Proof-of-Work, as implemented in Bitcoin, has a significant impact on energy consumption and compromises the scalability, efficiency, and latency of the system. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consensus model (PSC-Bchain) composed of Proof of Credibility and Proof of Stake that work mutually to address the aforementioned problems to secure e-voting systems. Smart contracts are used to provide a trustworthy public bulletin board and a secure computing environment to ensure the accuracy of the ballot outcome. We combine a sharding mechanism with the PSC-Bchain hybrid approach to emphasize security, thus enhancing the scalability and performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system. Furthermore, we compare and discuss the execution of attacks on the classical blockchain and our proposed hybrid blockchain, and analyze the security. Our experiments yielded new observations on the overall security, performance, and scalability of blockchain-based e-voting systems. © 2020 ETRI},

However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network. © 2021 ACM.},

The amount of transaction fee depends on the size of that contract and the operations executed by that contract. Consequently, smart contracts with inefficient code will waste money. In this article, we propose and develop the first tool, named GasChecker, for automatically identifying gas-inefficient code in smart contracts, and conduct the first empirical study on the prevalence of gas-inefficient code in the deployed smart contracts. More precisely, we first summarize ten gas-inefficient programming patterns and propose a new approach based on symbolic execution (SE) to detect them in the bytecode of smart contracts. To make our approach scalable to analyze millions of smart contracts, we parallelize SE by tailoring it to the MapReduce programming model, and propose a new feedback-based load balancing strategy to effectively utilize cloud resources. Extensive experiments show that GasChecker scales well with the increase of workers. The empirical study demonstrates that lots of real smart contracts contain various inefficient code. Manual investigation demonstrates that only 2.5 percent of discovered gas-inefficient instances are false positives.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This feature has encouraged various sectors to make use of smart contracts when transacting. Experience shows that many deployed contracts are vulnerable to exploitation due to their poor design, which allows attackers to steal valuable assets from the involved parties. Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Scalability is a common issue among the most used permissionless blockchains, and several approaches have been proposed to solve this issue. Tackling scalability while preserving the security and decentralization of the network is an important challenge. To deliver effective scaling solutions, Ethereum is on the path of a major protocol improvement called Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2), which implements sharding. As the change of consensus mechanism is an extremely delicate matter, this improvement will be achieved through different phases, the first of which is the implementation of the Beacon Chain. For this, a specification has been developed, and multiple groups have implemented clients to run the new protocol. This work analyzes the resource usage behavior of different clients running as Eth2 nodes, comparing their performance and analyzing differences. Our results show multiple important network perturbations and how different clients react to them. We discuss the differences between Eth2 clients and their limitations. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are immutable, verifiable, and autonomous pieces of code that can be deployed and ran on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Due to the immutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart contract or a verified transaction. On the other hand, there are millions of dollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty smart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for smart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code before deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing mechanism for smart contracts in the Solidity language, based on mutation testing. We analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts and designed 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our experimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate 10 out of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of dollars loss. We also have extended the Universal Mutator tool with our mutation operators to generate mutants for smart contracts written in Solidity, automatically. © 2020 IEEE.},

The increasingly competitive environment is pushing insurance companies to use advanced technologies to address multiple challenges, namely lack of trust, lack of transparency, and economic instability. To this end, blockchain is used as an emerging technology that enables transparent and secure data storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose CioSy, a collaborative blockchain-based insurance system for monitoring and processing the insurance transactions. To the best of our knowledge, the existing approaches do not consider collaborative insurance to achieve an automated, transparent, and tamper-proof solution. CioSy aims at automating the insurance policy processing, claim handling, and payment using smart contracts. For validation purposes, an experimental prototype is developed on Ethereum blockchain.

	abstract = {Smart contract-enabled blockchains allow building decentralized applications in which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle services emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds. Unfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under what is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side and showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered collaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart contract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative attack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all previous works required a technique to quantify an attacker’s individual contribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our framework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless collaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the attack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform the attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers’ interaction as a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in proportion to the amount of their bets in the game’s unique equilibrium. We also model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and prove that it is a strategy-proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs stored on blockchains to execute transactions. When input constraints or security properties are violated at runtime, the transaction being executed by a smart contract needs to be reverted to avoid undesirable consequences. On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that supports smart contracts, developers can choose among three transaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if...revert, and if...throw) to handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements are vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or suffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are used in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to characterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts. We measured the prevalence of these statements in 3, 866 verified smart contracts from popular dapps and built a taxonomy of their purposes via manually analyzing 557 transaction-reverting statements. We also compared template contracts and their corresponding custom contracts to understand how developers customize the use of transaction-reverting statements. Finally, we analyzed the security impact of transaction-reverting statements by removing them from smart contracts and comparing the mutated contracts against the original ones. Our study led to important findings. For example, we found that transaction-reverting statements are commonly used to perform seven types of authority verifications or validity checks, and missing such statements may compromise the security of smart contracts. We also found that current smart contract security analyzers cannot effectively handle transaction-reverting statements when detecting security vulnerabilities. Our findings can shed light on further research in the broad area of smart contract quality assurance and provide practical guidance to smart contract developers on the appropriate use of transaction-reverting statements.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Certified mail is a special postal service that provides the sender with a proof that the mail was successfully received by the other party. However, when it comes to certified electronic mail (CEM), there has not been a widely accepted protocol yet. Most of the existing solutions rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in order to achieve fairness, which can become a bottleneck and lead to more charges and computations. Other solutions that do not rely on a TTP have a relatively high computation and communication overhead. Blockchains have allowed the creation of TTP-free protocols for fair exchange; however, the existing Blockchain-based protocols are either too expensive or do not meet the necessary fairness and confidentiality guarantees. In this work, we have developed two TTP-free Blockchain-based protocols for certified electronic mail that achieve the required security properties of strong fairness, non-repudiation, timeliness, and confidentiality. The first protocol uses simple bitcoin transactions for a single receiver, whereas the second one implements smart contracts for one or multiple receivers. We have analyzed and compared both protocols to existing TTP-free Blockchain solutions and have demonstrated their superior properties and cost. Furthermore, we have implemented the two protocols in a realistic testbed, demonstrating the viability of our approach.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Such automation is enabled by the ‘Turing-complete’ nature of the programming language (Solidity) in which SCs are written. This also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency platform. In this work, we study the correlation between malicious activities and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of the severity score towards detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the inclusion of the smart contract vulnerability scores in the feature set. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The practice of writing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain is quite recent and still in development. A blockchain developer should expect constant changes in the security software field, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new good practices are developed. Following the security practices accepted in the blockchain community is not enough to ensure the writing of secure smart contracts. The paper aims to study the practice of code cloning among the smart contracts by analyzing two corpora. The first corpus, the "Smart-Corpus", includes smart contracts already deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The second corpus, the "Open-Zeppelin's Solidity Library", is supervised by a community of developers who constantly take care to increase the security and efficiency of the smart contracts included in the corpus. From the comparative analysis of the corpora, we observe that the smart contracts developers frequently duplicate the code by cloning already existing smart contracts which are not part of the "OpenZeppelin corpus". In particular, we found that 79.1% of smart contracts contain duplicated code and only 18.4% of smart contracts reuse the code by implementing a smart corpus belonging to the OpenZeppelin repository. The paper discusses the advantages and the disadvantages of code duplication in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and suggests to refer to the smart contracts of the OpenZeppelin's Solidity Library. The Ethereum blockchain community can indeed benefit from using the tested code presented in OpenZeppelin's Solidity Library to increase its security. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention due to the boom of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Among them, the emerging blockchain-based crowdsourcing is a typical paradigm, which gets rid of centralized cloud-servers and leverages smart contracts to realize task recommendation and reward distribution. However, there are still two critical issues yet to be solved urgently. First, malicious evaluation from crowdsourcing requesters will result in honest workers not getting the rewards they deserve even if they have provided valuable solutions. Second, unfair evaluation and reward distribution can lead to low enthusiasm for work. Therefore, the above problems will seriously hinder the development of blockchain-based crowdsourcing platforms. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework with enhanced trustworthiness and fairness, named TFCrowd. The core idea of TFCrowd is utilizing a smart contract of blockchain as a trusted authority to fairly evaluate contributions and allocate rewards. To this end, we devise a reputation-based evaluation mechanism to punish the requester who behaves as “false-reporting” and a Shapley value-based method to distribute rewards fairly. By using our proposed schemes, TFCrowd can prevent malicious requesters from making unfair comments and reward honest workers according to their contributions. Extensive simulations and the experiment results demonstrate that TFCrowd can protect the interests of workers and distribute rewards fairly. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Due to the free mobility of the nodes, routing security has been a bottleneck problem that plagues its development. Therefore, a multi-path QoS (quality of service) routing security algorithm based on blockchain by improving the traditional AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) protocol (AODV-MQS) is proposed. Firstly, a chain of nodes is established in the network and the states of all nodes by making the intermediate nodes on the chain are saved. Secondly, the smart contract in the blockchain is set to filter out the nodes that meet the QoS constraints. Finally, two largest unrelated communication paths are found in the blockchain network through smart contract, one of which is the main path and the other is the standby path. Simulation experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms, especially in an unsafe environment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Also, it designs the domain name data synchronization algorithm and consistency checking algorithm to achieve synchronization and quick consistency checking of domain name data. At last, this paper introduces the domain name resolution process of this model. Experimental results show that the proposed DNS service model not only realizes the decentralization of domain name resolution but also improves query efficiency. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

The main advantage is to let the users have flexible restrictions, represented using fuzzy sets, and to develop smart contracts where there is a partial agreement among the involved parts. We propose a general architecture based on four fuzzy ontologies and a process to develop and run the smart contracts, based on a reduction to a well-known fuzzy ontology reasoning task (Best Satisfiability Degree).

This paper presents such an approach, which, in combination with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and State machine diagrams, allows the smart contract structure and behavior logic to be modeled in several abstraction layers. This paper delves into details on how the model-to-model transformations from the specified Blockchain Platform Independent Model (PIM) with specified state-like behavior can be used to produce a Solidity Platform Specific Model (PSM). Subsequently, we elaborate on how the Solidity PSM is used for Solidity smart contract code generation by employing model-to-text transformations. The paper also demonstrates the process of our proposed transformations and code generation using smart contract code examples from Solidity documentation. Based on the examples, a Blockchain PIM is specified and transformed to Solidity PSM, which is then used for Solidity smart contract code generation. The generated smart contract code is then compiled, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain JavaScript virtual machine, and compared to the original smart contract code in terms of Solidity code metrics, similarity scores, and execution costs. The evaluation results indicate that our approach could be successfully used to model and later generate smart contract code.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps. © 2020 The Authors},

The presented solution also addresses the IoT systems' scalability challenges, the processing power and storage issues of the IoT edge devices in the blockchain network. A set of built-in queries is leveraged by smart-contracts technology to define the rules and conditions. The paper validates the performance of the proposed model with practical implementation by measuring performance metrics such as transaction throughput and latency, resource consumption, and network use. The results show that the proposed platform with the HLF implementation is promising for the security of resource-constrained IoT devices and is scalable for deployment in various IoT scenarios.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has become particularly popular due to its promise to support business-critical services in very different domains (e.g., retail, healthcare). Blockchain systems rely on complex middleware, like Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric, that allow running smart contracts, which specify business logic in cooperative applications. The presence of software defects in these contracts has notably caused failures, including severe security problems. In this article, we use software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI) to assess the behavior of permissioned blockchain systems in the presence of faulty smart contracts.We emulate the occurrence of general software faults and also blockchain-specific software faults (e.g., missing require on transaction sender) in smart contracts code and observe the impact on the overall system dependability in terms of reliability and integrity. We also analyze the effectiveness of formal verification and runtime protection mechanisms in detecting the injected faults. Results indicate that formal verification and runtime protections have to complement built-in platform checks to guarantee proper dependability of blockchain systems. The work presented in this article allows smart contract developers to become aware of possible faults in smart contracts and to understand the impact of their presence. It also provides valuable information for middleware developers to improve the overall fault tolerance of their systems. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Project delivery on time, with agreed quality and assigned budget, is the desire of project-based companies. Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contracts are seen as the major building blocks for future autonomous blockchain- and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based applications. Engineering such contracts for trustless, append-only, and decentralized digital ledgers allows mutually distrustful parties to transform legal requirements into immutable and formalized rules. Previous experience shows this to be a challenging task due to demanding socio-technical ecosystems and the specificities of decentralized ledger technology. In this paper, we therefore develop an integrated process model for engineering DLT-based smart contracts that accounts for the specificities of DLT. This model was iteratively refined with the support of industry experts. The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Resource-constrained blockchain clients and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices pose limitations in terms of processing and storing the entire blockchain ledger and mining blocks. Such clients and devices rely on a view of the blockchain provided by full nodes acting as gateways. However, gateway nodes sometimes can provide a distorted view of the blockchain that makes lightweight clients vulnerable to the eclipse attack. When under such an attack, a client cannot differentiate between a forked view of the blockchain and the legitimate blockchain ledger leading to fatal consequences and huge losses incurred. In this paper, we propose a data attestation solution that employs full nodes as validators to attest the responses reported by gateways of lightweight nodes. We leverage smart contracts to give lightweight clients confidence in the data reported as they are unable to validate it from the blockchain network themselves. The system governs the attestation process that comprises submitting attestation requests, approving them, recording the response of validators, and manage payments. Clients can, thereafter, provide their feedback about the validator/gateway performance in the form of a reputation score. We present the proposed system architecture and describe its implementation on the Ethereum blockchain network. We evaluate the proposed solution with respect to functionality testing, cost of execution, and security analysis of the developed smart contracts. We make our smart contracts code and testing scripts publicly available.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Standardization of blockchains is an appeal to raise the development of information technologies to the next level.

Nevertheless, the transactional semantics of SC which follow ACID transactions are not appropriate for BP characteristics. Indeed, it is admitted that ACID transactions are limited to cope with complex control structure and long running execution of BP. Transactional Business Processes (TBP for short) have emerged as an extension to ACID models to overcome these limits. A TBP ensures transactional reliability of advanced transactions having a control structure as complex as for BP. In this paper, we propose an approach that builds on SC and extends them to implement TBP.

	abstract = {Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure, Blockchain-based financial and business transactions. However, many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the approach in a web-based tool, named Smartembed, to facilitate Solidity developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs. which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of Smartembed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem as well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our research.

	abstract = {Blockchain has become a pervasive technology in a wide number of sectors like industry, research, and academy. With the emergence of blockchain, new solutions with this technology to existing problems were devised, leading to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts are similar to traditional contracts with the benefits provided by blockchain, such as immutability, privacy, and decentralisation. These contracts are usually defined based on a specific domain, and this domain knowledge can be represented through an ontology. Researches have explored the benefits of using domain ontologies with smart contracts, such as code generation, discovering other contracts in the network, or interaction with other contracts. Notwithstanding, the representation of smart contract languages themselves has not been studied. In this paper, we present an ontology for a well-known smart contract language, Solidity, defining all entities needed to cover the whole language and aligning it to other standardised ontologies such as EthOn, in a way to improve the knowledge of the ontology developed. Furthermore, the ontology has also been validated with already deployed contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, Solidity will be able to benefit from the advantages provided by ontologies, such as interoperability and the use of semantic web technologies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Since then, thanks to its peculiarities and capabilities of implementing smart contracts, blockchain technology has undergone a strong development in different application domains. The interest around this technology also brought to the definition of several platforms facilitating its use and application. Due to their variety,, choosing the most suitable blockchain platform to support a specific business need represents a strategic problem. This paper proposes an analysis for the definition of an evaluation framework and related quality attributes, helping to characterize and compare different blockchain platforms for identifying the most suitable one to the implementation of smart contracts in a specific business context. The analysis of a set of blockchain platforms is proposed for discussing the applicability and use of the proposed framework. © 2021, EasyChair. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Invoice factoring is a very useful tool for developing businesses that face liquidity problems. The main property that a factoring system needs to fulfill is to prevent an invoice from being factored twice. In order to prevent double factoring, many factoring ecosystems use one or several centralized entities to register factoring agreements. However, this puts a lot of power in the hands of these centralized entities and makes it difficult for users to dispute situations in which factoring data is unavailable, wrongly recorded or manipulated by negligence or on purpose. In this article, we propose an architecture for invoice factoring registration based on a public blockchain. To solve the aforementioned drawbacks, we replace the trusted third parties for factoring registration with a smart contract. Using a smart contract, we record digital evidence of the terms and conditions of factoring agreements in explicit detail, allowing auditability and dispute resolution. Relevant information is highly available on the blockchain while its privacy is protected. The registration is optimal, since it needs only one blockchain transaction and one key-value storage per invoice factoring.  © 2013 IEEE.},

To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of blockchain-based DApps to date, based on an extensive dataset of 995 Ethereum DApps and 29,846,075 transaction logs over them. We make a descriptive analysis of the popularity of DApps, summarize the patterns of how DApps use smart contracts to access the underlying blockchain, and explore the worth-addressing issues of deploying and operating DApps. Based on the findings, we propose some implications for DApp users to select proper DApps, for DApp developers to improve the efficiency of DApps, and for blockchain vendors to enhance the support of DApps. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Today's blockchain landscape is severely fragmented as more and more heterogeneous blockchain platforms have been developed in recent years. These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions. © 2021 IEEE.},

Many edge cloud-based system designs have been proposed, but some technical challenges still remain, such as low quality of services (QoS), data privacy and system security due to centralized healthcare architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach of data offloading and data sharing for healthcare using edge cloud and blockchain. First, an efficient data offloading scheme is proposed where IoT health data can be offloaded to nearby edge servers for data processing with privacy awareness. Then, a data sharing scheme is integrated to enable data exchange among healthcare users via blockchain. Particularly, a trustworthy access control mechanism is developed using smart contracts for access authentication to achieve secure EHRs sharing. Implementation results from extensive real-world experiments show the superior advantages of the proposal over the existing schemes in terms of improved QoS, enhanced data privacy and security, and low smart contract costs.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Security and privacy issues have become a rapidly growing problem with the fast development of big data in public health. However, big data faces many ongoing serious challenges in the process of collection, storage, and use. Among them, data security and privacy problems have attracted extensive interest. In an effort to overcome this challenge, this article aims to present a distributed privacy preservation approach based on smart contracts and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). First of all, we define SGX as a trusted edge computing node, design data access module, data protection module, and data integrity check module, to achieve hardware-enhanced data privacy protection. Then, we design a smart contract framework to realize distributed data access control management in a big data environment. The crucial role of the smart contract was revealed by designing multiple access control contracts, register contracts, and history contracts. Access control contracts provide access control methods for different users and enable static access verification and dynamic access verification by checking the user's properties and history behavior. Register contract contains user property information, edge computing node information, the access control and history smart contract information, and provides functions such as registration, update, and deletion. History contract records the historical behavior information of malicious users, receives the report information of malicious requestors from the access control contract, implements a misbehavior check method to determines whether the requestor has misbehavior, and returns the corresponding result. Finally, we design decentralized system architecture, prove the security properties, and analysis to verify the feasibility of the system. Results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the timeliness of data, reduce network latency, and ensure the security, reliability, and traceability of data. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Companies increasingly tender knowledge-intensive tasks using crowdsourcing platforms to gain access to scarce knowledge and skills otherwise out of reach, and in this way, gaining competitive advantage. Despite its potential, existing crowdsourcing platforms encounter several challenges, including (1) fragmentation of expertise, as there are many platforms, (2) distrust between task providers and crowdsourcing participants, as identity and past performance are often not known, and (3) inability to learn from experience due to a lack of openness. A reference architecture for blockchain-based knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing platforms to mediate transactions between demand and supply of knowledge is designed in this paper to overcome these challenges. A design science research method is followed to develop the architecture. The reference architecture shows how blockchain and smart contract components can be integrated to support and coordinate knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing activities. By removing traditional e-commerce intermediaries, blockchain reduces search friction, knowledge transfer costs, and cheating by task providers or crowdsourcing participants. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In addition to the exhibition, collection, research, and educational functions of the museum, the development of a future museum includes the trend of leisure and sightseeing. Although the museum is a non-profit organization, if it can provide digital exhibits and collections under the premises of “intellectual property rights” and “cultural assets protection”, and licensing and adding value in various fields, it can generate revenue from digital licensing and handle the expenses of museum operations. This will be a new trend in the sustainable development of museum operations. Especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of this year (2020), the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) recently stated that nearly a third of the museums in the United States may be permanently closed since museum operations are facing “extreme financial difficulties.” This research is aimed at museums using the business model of “digital authorization”. It proposes an authorization mechanism based on block chain technology protecting the museums’ digital rights in the business model and the application of cryptography. The signature and time stamp mechanism achieve non-repudiation and timeless mechanism, which combines block chain and smart contracts to achieve verifiability, un-forgery, decentralization, and traceability, as well as the non-repudiation of the issue of cash flow with signatures and digital certificates, for the digital rights of museums in business. The business model proposes achievable sustainable development. Museums not only achieve the goal of promoting social education, but also solve their financial problems. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain systems have gained substantial traction recently, partlydue to the potential of decentralized immutable mediation of economic activities. Ethereum is a prominent example that has theprovision for executing stateful computing scripts known as SmartContracts. These smart contracts resemble traditional programs, butwith immutability being the core differentiating factor. Given theirimmutability and potential high monetary value, it becomes imperative to develop high-quality smart contracts. Software metricshave traditionally been an essential tool in determining programming quality. Given the similarity between smart contracts (writtenin Solidity for Ethereum) and object-oriented (OO) programming,OO metrics would appear applicable. In this paper, we empiricallyevaluate inheritance-based metrics as applied to smart contracts.We adopt this focus because, traditionally, inheritance has beenlinked to a more complex codebase which we posit is not the casewith Solidity based smart contracts. In this work, we evaluate thehypothesis that, due to the differences in the context of smart contracts and OO programs, it may not be appropriate to use the sameinterpretation of inheritance based metrics for assessment. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A PKI is an infrastructure based on a hierarchical model, but the use of PKIs in non-hierarchical contexts has exposed them to many types of attacks. Here, we discuss weaknesses exploited in past attacks and we propose a solution based on an original consensus algorithm developed for use on blockchain technology. In this implementation we retain the full functionality around X.509 certificates, i.e., for the triad (server name, server address, X.509 server certificate), and demonstrate a mechanism for obtaining fast consensus. The main properties of the solution are that a consensus may be reached even when not all members of the involved PKI participate in a transaction, and that no advanced trust agreement among PKIs is needed. The proposed solution is able to detect PKI attacks and can distinguish errors from attacks, allowing precise management of anomalies. © 2020 by the author.},

	abstract = {From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has attracted much attention from people around the world. Scammers take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain to implement financial fraud. The Ponzi scheme, one of the main scam methods, has defrauded investors of large amounts of money, thereby harming their interests and hindering the application of blockchain. Unfortunately, the current detection technology typically largely relies on the source code of the contract or uses a single feature which does not fully represent the contract characteristics. In such a case, the detection of Ponzi schemes with high efficiency becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose an image-based scam detection method using an attention capsule network (SE-CapsNet) focused on Ethereum. The sequence of bytecode, the opcode frequency, and the application binary interface (ABI) call are extracted as features from the contract bytecode and ABI, further converted into grayscale images, and then mapped into three color channels to generate RGB images, which are used as the input of the model for detecting the Ponzi scheme contract. In addition, we employ fancy PCA for data augmentation to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the detection results. Experimental results show that the image-based detection method using deep learning models can effectively detect contracts before transactions occur. Among them, our proposed SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results, with an F1 score of 98.38%.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The oil and gas industry involves a high level of operational expenditure and often faces high risks of asset safety and operational failures. It has never been so important to monitor and control the oil field operations remotely in real-time to ensure safety and efficiency. The traditional monitoring and control systems for oil field operations are typically centralized, prone to failure, and lack efficiency. Blockchain technology mitigates the centralization problem by creating a decentralized, immutable and transparent control environment for automatic monitoring and control of industrial operations. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based IoT framework for real-time monitoring and control to increase oil field operation and asset efficiency and safety. We present the key components of the framework, including the system architecture, operation flows, algorithms, and smart contracts. As a proof-of-concept modeling, a smart contract is developed and validated on a blockchain test platform. A comparative analysis shows the advantages of using blockchain technology and smart contract to provide trustworthy and automatic monitoring and control for oil field operations. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the recent development in network technology over a few years, digital works can be easily published online. One of the main issues in the field of digital technology is the infringement of digital works, which can seriously damage the data owners’ rights and affects the enthusiasm of the owners to create original work. Thus, more attention is required for the protection of digital copyright as it has a great impact on the development of society. Many digital copyright protection techniques were developed in the past, but still, there are many loopholes in the protection systems to be covered. The protection means are still relatively weak, timeliness is poor, infringement is frequent, a right determination is cumbersome, and the results are not ideal. Aiming at the mentioned problems, this paper proposes a protection technique, which can realize the automatic management of the complete life cycle on the blockchain using fabric's smart contract technology. The proposed system is based on blockchain technology, which leverages the tamper-proof and traceable characteristics of blockchain. The system smart contracts to manage the full life cycle of digital copyright. The test results system and can efficiently confirm the rights of digital copyright. © Copyright 2021 Liu et al.

	abstract = {Since the emergence of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the blockchain technology has become the new Internet tool with which researchers claim to be able to solve any existing online problem. From immutable log ledger applications to authorisation systems applications, the current technological consensus implies that most of Internet problems could be effectively solved by deploying some form of blockchain environment. Regardless this 'consensus', there are decentralised Internet-based applications on which blockchain technology can actually solve several problems and improve the functionality of these applications. The development of these new blockchain-based solutions is grouped into a new paradigm called Blockchain 3.0 and its concepts go far beyond the well-known cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we study the current trends in the application of blockchain on the paradigm of Public Key Infrastructures (PKI). In particular, we focus on how these current trends can guide the exploration of a fully Decentralised Identity System, with blockchain as be part of the core technology.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are computerized transaction protocols built on top of blockchain networks. Users are charged with fees, a.k.a. gas in Ethereum, when they create, deploy or execute smart contracts. Since smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities which may result in huge financial loss, developers and smart contract compilers often insert codes for security checks. The trouble is that those codes consume gas every time they are executed. Many of the inserted codes are however redundant. In this work, we present sOptimize, a tool that optimizes smart contract gas consumption automatically without compromising functionality or security. sOptimize works on smart contract bytecode, statically identifies 3 kinds of code patterns, and further removes them through verification-assisted techniques. The resulting code is guaranteed to be equivalent to the original one and can be directly deployed on blockchain. We evaluate sOptimize on a collection of 1,152 real-world smart contracts and show that it optimizes 43% of them, and the reduction on gas consumption is about 2.0% while in deployment and 1.2% in transactions, the amount can be as high as 954,201 gas units per contract.  © 2021 IEEE.},

However, several challenges restrict the widespread adoption of the technology and data privacy, with throughput and scalability issues, ranks amongst the foremost. In this paper, we introduce a novel privacy management plane which integrates differential privacy to query existing relational databases through the blockchain as well as spearheads the use of blockchain for local differential privacy. The distinguishing feature in the latter is that the privacy management plane gives the data owners the right to perturb their data with the desired privacy budget, while in the former it gives the right to the data curator to change the privacy budget dynamically while answering queries through the blockchain. The paper also includes experimental evaluation of the developed privacy management plane and integrates management operations in it through another smart contract. The paper addresses the issue of GDPR and it's implications in the context of blockchain data, while highlighting the compliance of the proposed implementation.  © 2020 IEEE.},

We also integrate property-based testing into ConCert using QuickChick and our development is the first to support testing properties of interacting smart contracts. We test several complex contracts such as a DAO-like contract, an escrow contract, an implementation of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) contract which includes a custom token standard (Tezos FA2), and more.

	abstract = {The creative introduction of the smart contracts in Ethereum, which are Turing-complete programs, boosted blockchain to the second generation. Meantime, the specifically designed young and fast-evolving programming languages, such as Solidity, become the key factors behind smart contracts being the breeding ground of ubiquitous defects. As many contract defects occur within certain compiler versions, knowing the specific compiler version used to generate the contract's bytecode, facilitates the design of more targeted defect detection approaches, and provides ways to estimate the risks faced of invoking it. To this end, we propose VSmart (compiler Version identification for Smart contract), which takes in the bytecode of the smart contract to be analyzed and outputs the major compiler version used to produce it. The basic idea is to leverage deep neural networks to grasp version-indicative features from contracts' normalized opcode sequences, and train classifiers on a data set consisting of 131,546 smart contracts with ground-truth labels we collected from Etherscan. The performance evaluation conducted shows that VSmart achieves nearly 98% accuracy in identifying major Solidity compiler versions. Further, on the basis of VSmart, we perform an empirical study on the distribution of the Solidity compiler versions on a wild data set consisting of 15,326,672 nontrivial smart contracts actually deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The landscape estimation results show that the Solidity version distribution is rather imbalanced, with Solidity 0.4 being the most popular one; and the developers' Solidity usage practices conflict with the official's suggestion of always using the latest version, while they tend to gradually switch to newer versions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

Especially in developing countries, corruption is a widespread issue due to secrecy and lack of transparency. An important instrument for transparency and accounta-bility assurance is the record which is managed and controlled by recordkeeping systems. Block-chain technology and more precisely blockchain-based smart contracts are emerging technological tools that can be used as recordkeeping systems and a tool to mitigate some of the fraud involving public procurement records. Immutability, transparency, distribution and automation are some of the features of smart contracts already implemented in several applications to avoid malicious human interference. In this paper, we discuss some of the frauds in public procurement, and we pro-pose smart contracts to automatize different stages of the public procurement procedure attempting to fix their biggest current weaknesses. The processes we have focused on include the bidding pro-cess, supplier habilitation and delivery verification. In the three subprocesses, common irregulari-ties include human fallibility, improper information disclosure and hidden agreements which con-cern not only governments but also civil society.

The cloud server provides the IT resources required by customers in a self-service manner through the network, realizing business expansion and rapid innovation. However, due to the insufficient protection of data privacy, the problem of data privacy leakage in cloud storage is threatening cloud computing. To address the problem, we propose BC-PECK, a data protection scheme based on blockchain and public key searchable encryption. Firstly, all the data is protected by the encryption algorithm. The privacy data is encrypted and stored in a cloud server, while the ciphertext index is established by a public key searchable encryption scheme and stored on the blockchain. Secondly, based on the characteristics of trusted execution of smart contract technology, a control mechanism for data accessing and sharing is given. Data transaction is automatically recorded on the blockchain, which is fairer under the premise of ensuring the privacy and security of the data sharing process. Finally, we analyzed the security and fairness of the current scheme. Through the comparison with similar schemes, we have shown the advantages of the proposed scheme. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Today's platforms and systems leveraged for managing data related to COVID-19 vaccines' distribution and delivery fall short in providing transparency, trackability and traceability, immutability, audit, and trust features. Also, they are vulnerable to the single point of failure problem due to centralization. Such limitations hindering the safe, secure, transparent, trustworthy, and reliable distribution and delivery process of COVID-19 vaccines. In this paper, we propose an Ethereum blockchain-based solution for managing data related to COVID-19 vaccines' distribution and delivery. We develop smart contracts to automate the traceability of COVID-19 vaccines while ensuring data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability. We integrate the Ethereum blockchain with off-chain storage to manage non-critical and large-sized data. We present algorithms and discuss their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We evaluate the proposed solution by performing cost and security analysis as well as comparing it with the existing non-blockchain and blockchain-based solutions. Performance evaluation results reveal that the proposed solution is low-cost, and our smart contracts are secure enough against possible attacks and vulnerabilities.

The crucial factor in the LCT is to ensure the validity of gathered data as numerous supply chain phases are involved and the data is assessed by multiple stakeholders. Frauds and swindling activities can be prevented if the history of the vehicles is made available to the interested parties. Blockchain provides a way of enforcing trustworthiness to the supply chain participants and the data associated with the various actions performed. Machine learning techniques when combined decentralized nature of blockchains can be used to develop a robust Vehicle LCT model. In the proposed work, Harmonic Optimized Gradient Descent and Łukasiewicz Fuzzy (HOGD-LF) Vehicle Life Cycle Tracking in Cloud Environment is proposed and it involves three stages. First, the Progressive Harmonic Optimized User Registration and Authentication model is designed for computationally efficient registration and authentication. Next, for the authentic user, the Gradient Descent Blockchain-based SVM Data Encryption model is designed with minimum CPU utilization.

	abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are widely used in blockchain to represent unique and non-interchangeable assets. Current NFTs allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this paper is the proposal of smart NFTs to represent IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Hence, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to its IoT device thanks to the use of a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key and, then, its BCA address. The link between tokens and devices is difficult to break and can be traced during their lifetime, because devices execute a secure boot and carry out mutual authentication processes with new owners and users that could add new software. Hence, devices prove their trusted hardware and software. A whole demonstration of the proposal developed with ESP32-based IoT devices and Ethereum blockchain is presented, using the SRAM of the ESP32 microcontroller as the PUF. © 2021 by the authors.

The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {Non-fungible tokens are an up and coming application domain for smart contracts. Ethereum is the first blockchain-based decentralized computing platform that has standardized this type of tokens into a well-defined interface, namely ERC721. We propose a framework that provides developers with a smart contract suite that offers complete implementations of the ERC721 standard and common extensions and features frequently encountered in ERC721-based applications. We introduce a specification language that enables customization and configuration of the smart contract suite by including and excluding the supported features and extensions. We evaluate the smart contract suite for its extensibility and reusability and compare the metrics with four reference implementations tackling a similar problem. In addition to this, we evaluate and analyze the effort and efficiency of the specification language in comparison to manual configuration of the smart contract suite. Our contribution lies in examining quality metrics for code extensibility and reusability and determining the more insightful metrics for assessing these quality attributes in the context of Solidity smart contracts. Additionally, from the lines of code metric, We conclude that our specification language offers a simple and efficient alternative to manual smart contract suite customization. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the logistic chain domain, the traceability of shipments in their entire delivery process from the shipper to the consignee involves many stakeholders. From the traceability data, contractual decisions may be taken such as incident detection, validation of the delivery or billing. The stakeholders require transparency in the whole process. The combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the blockchain paradigms helps in the development of automated and trusted systems. In this context, ensuring the quality of the IoT data is an absolute requirement for the adoption of those technologies. In this article, we propose an approach to assess the data quality (DQ) of IoT data sources using a logistic traceability smart contract developed on top of a blockchain. We select the quality dimensions relevant to our context, namely accuracy, completeness, consistency and currentness, with a proposition of their corresponding measurement methods. We also propose a data quality model specific to the logistic chain domain and a distributed traceability architecture. The evaluation of the proposal shows the capacity of the proposed method to assess the IoT data quality and ensure the user agreement on the data qualification rules. The proposed solution opens new opportunities in the development of automated logistic traceability systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {As a key technology for the development of 5G networks, network slicing is developing rapidly. Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice. IEEE},

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has influenced the financial industry by creating a new crypto-economy. Then, next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party have emerged thanks to the appearance of smart contracts, which are computer protocols designed to facilitate, verify, and enforce automatically the negotiation and agreement among multiple untrustworthy parties. Despite the bright side of smart contracts, several concerns continue to undermine their adoption, such as security threats, vulnerabilities, and legal issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of blockchain-enabled smart contracts from both technical and usage points of view. To do so, we present a taxonomy of existing blockchain-enabled smart contract solutions, categorize the included research papers, and discuss the existing smart contract-based studies. Based on the findings from the survey, we identify a set of challenges and open issues that need to be addressed in future studies.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has recently inspired remarkable attention due to its unique features, such as privacy, accountability, immutability, and anonymity, to name of the few. In contrast, core functionalities of most Internet of Things (IoT) resources make them vulnerable to security threats. The IoT devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have limited capacity in terms of network, computing, and storage, which make them easier for vulnerable threats. Furthermore, a massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices, which is still an open challenge for the existing platforms to process, analyze, and unearth underlying patterns to provide convenience environment. Therefore, a new solution is required to ensure data accountability, improve data privacy and accessibility, and extract hidden patterns and useful knowledge to provide adequate services. In this paper, we present a secure fitness framework that is based on an IoT-enabled blockchain network integrated with machine learning approaches. The proposed framework consists of two modules: a blockchainbased IoT network to provide security and integrity to sensing data as well as an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine to discover hidden insights and useful knowledge from IoT and user device network data. The enhanced smart contract aims to support users with a practical application that provides real-time monitoring, control, easy access, and immutable logs of multiple devices that are deployed in several domains. The inference engine module aims to unearth underlying patterns and useful knowledge from IoT environment data, which helps in effective decision making to provide convenient services. For experimental analysis, we implement an intelligent fitness service that is based on an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine as a case study where several IoT fitness devices are used to securely acquire user personalized fitness data. Furthermore, a real-time inference engine investigates user personalized data to discover useful knowledge and hidden insights. Based on inference engine knowledge, a recommendation model is developed to recommend a daily and monthly diet, as well as a workout plan for better and improved body shape. The recommendation model aims to facilitate a trainer formulating effective future decisions of trainee’s health in terms of a diet and workout plan. Lastly, for performance analysis, we have used Hyperledger Caliper to access the system performance in terms of latency, throughput, resource utilization, and varying orderer and peers nodes. The analysis results imply that the design architecture is applicable for resource-constrained IoT blockchain platform and it is extensible for different IoT scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

It has been applied in numbers of aspects of society, including finance, judiciary and commerce. Ethereum is referred to as the next generation decentralized application platform. It is one of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts. Smart contract is a set of codes that sored on blockchain and can be called and created as turing-complete programs running on the blockchain. Developers use smart contracts to build decentralized applications (Dapp) which has widely used cryptocurrency related project. As smart contracts become more popular and more valuable, they are faced with more risk of being hacked. As a result that smart contracts cannot be modified once deployed on the blockchain, it is a great challenge to fix and update deployed vulnerable contract which can lead to a huge loss of cryptocurrency and financial disorder. In this paper, we focus on Integer Bugs in Ethereum Smart Contracts and present ISmart, which protects deployed smart contracts against attacks caused by Integer Bugs. We implemented ISmart based on go-ethereum, a Ethereum client written in Go, by adding a simplified taint analysis component. In our preliminary, ISmart can prevent attacks accurately with little runtime overhead. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the multiple points of innovation when combining blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) and security frameworks. The deployment and use of IoT device networks in smart city environments has produced an enormous amount of data. The fact that those data are possessed by multiple sources that use independent systems for data collection, storage, and use impedes the exploitation of their value. Blockchains, as distributed ledgers, can be used for addressing the development of a universal system for data collection and distribution. Smart contracts can be used to automate all the processes of such a network, while at the same time, blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protect sensitive data through anonymity and distributed storage. An innovative and open IoT blockchain market of applications, data, and services is proposed that: (i) provides the framework upon which objects and people can exchange value in form of virtual currencies, for assets (data and services) received; (ii) defines the motivation incentives according to social and business context for humans and smart objects to interact. The specific marketplace is piloted through a cross-border trial between Santander and Fujisawa, in the context of the M-Sec project, validating thus the interoperability, efficiency, and data protection principles. © 2021 by the authors.

Telehealth enables physicians and medical care providers to remotely care for patients and monitor their symptoms.

In addition, they are centralized and subject to the single point of control and failure. In this paper, we propose a private blockchain-based solution to overcome the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate how specifically three important telehealth services; namely, teleconsultation, drug administration, and medical testing can be enhanced using blockchain technology.

For storing and keeping track of large-size digital content, such as images and audio and video recordings of telehealth service sessions, our proposed solution is integrated with off-chain storage systems including cloud storage or a decentralized storage system as that of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The registered participants are provided with access privileges based on their roles to ensure that restrictions are enforced on-chain. Smart contracts are developed to maintain data provenance and generate reliable alerts and notifications. The implementation and testing details of the algorithms are presented.

The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology is seeking patient-centric HIE designs that shift data ownership from providers to patients. There are multiple barriers to patient-centric HIE in the current system, such as security and privacy concerns, data inconsistency, timely access to the right records across multiple healthcare facilities. After investigating the current workflow of HIE, this paper provides a feasible solution to these challenges by utilizing the unique features of blockchain, a distributed ledger technology which is considered 'unhackable'. Utilizing the smart contract feature, which is a programmable self-executing protocol running on a blockchain, we developed a blockchain model to protect data security and patients' privacy, ensure data provenance, and provide patients full control of their health records. By personalizing data segmentation and an 'allowed list' for clinicians to access their data, this design achieves patient-centric HIE. We conducted a large-scale simulation of this patient-centric HIE process and quantitatively evaluated the model's feasibility, stability, security, and robustness. © 2013 IEEE.},

Efficiently managing energy trading between energy providers and energy consumers can lead to meet the high demand for charging EVs while reducing its cost compared to traditional power provided by the utility company. However, a large portion of the existing systems leveraged for trading energy between EVs are centralized and fall short in providing transparency, reliability, audit, security, and trustworthy features. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based energy trading using an auctioning and reputation scheme. We develop Ethereum smart contracts which enable owners of EVs to automatically request electricity to charge their vehicles in a reliable, cost-effective, secure, and trustworthy manner. The proposed approach ensures the lowest rate available by implementing a reverse auctioning scheme for fair competition between providers to provide the requested service at the lowest cost. The proposed solution enforces high quality of service through a reputation-based approach that quantifies the performance of the service providers and gives an advantage to more reputable providers. We present the implementation details of the deployed system on a test Ethereum blockchain platform. We perform system testing and evaluation to validate and assess the functionality and performance of the proposed solution. Furthermore, we present security and cost analyses to show the affordability, robustness, and practicality of the proposed approach.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for exchanging cryptocurrencies as well as the most established for peer to peer programming and smart contracts publishing [3]. The versatility of the Solidity language allows developers to program general-purpose smart contracts. Among the various smart contracts, there may be some fraudulent ones, whose purpose is to steal Ether from the network participants. A notorious example of such cases are Ponzi schemes, i.e. a financial frauds that require investors to be repaid through the investments of others who have just entered the scheme. Within the Ethereum blockchain, several contracts have been identified as being Ponzi schemes. The paper proposes a machine learning model that uses textual classification techniques to recognize contracts emulating the behavior of a Ponzi scheme. Starting from a contracts dataset containing exclusively Ponzi schemes uploaded between 2016 and 2018, we built models able to properly classify Ponzi schemes contracts. We tested several models, some of which returned an overall accuracy of 99% on classification. The best model turned out to be the linear Support Vector Machine and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which provides the best results in terms of metrics evaluation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by high blood sugar levels, which can harm the kidneys, the heart, the eyes, and blood vessels. During the Covid-19 pandemic, diabetes patients were most affected. In the existing healthcare system, medical data is available in paper form or through a central server. Accessing the data from the central system and sharing it with all stakeholders would be a critical task during the pandemic. This research work deals with the design and implementation of a diabetes blockchain consortium. It can help all healthcare stakeholders to efficiently prioritize the needs of diabetes patients during a pandemic, such as oxygen beds, vaccinations, diabetes compensation, telemedicine, 5G-integrated remote location support, and other related records. The Ethereum sandbox simulation design is utilized to secure diabetes patients' healthcare records. The Interplanetary file system (IPFS) encrypts health data and sends it to the blockchain to ensure the privacy of personal healthcare information. The NEM symbol blockchain is used to develop this consortium as a proof-of-concept (PoC) model. Each stakeholder in a consortium is assigned NEM generated QR code to track records as a distributed ledger. A smart contract designed to run the diabetes blockchain application. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) authenticates users and restricts malicious nodes. Certainly, this research suggests aggregation of transactions and blocks in the blockchain, which would increase transaction speed, minimize transaction fees, and consume less power in a future blockchain design. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in information management systems coupled with machine learning algorithms paved the way for a significant revolution in animal healthcare industries. However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RIVIMS. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Flexible and distributed energy markets are a reality that is progressively reaching many regions. Despite their clear benefits, they should be accepted by the prosumers. Additionally, blockchain technology and smart contracts have been characterised as a technological enabler for the energy sector and P2P Energy Markets (PEM). However, little research has been done to explore blockchain's user-centred perspective. Therefore, this paper analyses the reluctance and/or concerns of prosumers regarding smart contracts, and investigates their perception on blockchain within PEMs. The authors present the results of a survey conducted across several European countries addressing the implementation of automated trading systems and analysing the adoption of smart contracts. Considering that the main survey outcomes are related to the regulation and legislation uncertainty around blockchain usage, this paper explores also the fit of smart contracts from a legal perspective. Additionally, a set of recommendations to be used as the basis for the design and development of PEMs is delivered, aiming to adopt blockchain and smart contracts. As a key take-away, the authors confirm the crucial role that blockchain will play in the deployment of fair, secure, flexible and distributed energy markets by ensuring transparency in the exchange of information between prosumers and energy stakeholders. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Services computing can offer a high-level abstraction to support diverse applications via encapsulating various computing infrastructures. Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Nonetheless, it has been still an issue keeping track of student/graduate academic achievement and blockchain access rights management. Detailed information about academic performance within a certain period (semester) is not present in the official education documents. Furthermore, academic achievement documents issued by institutions are not secured against unauthorized changes due to the involvement of intermediaries. Therefore, verification of official educational documents has become a pressing issue owing to the recent development of digital technologies. However, effective tools to accelerate the verification are rare as the process takes time. This study provides a prototype of the UniverCert platform based on a consortium version of the decentralized, open-source Ethereum blockchain technology. The proposed platform is based on a globally distributed peer-to-peer network that allows educational institutions to partner with the blockchain network, track student data, verify academic performance, and share documents with other stakeholders. The UniverCert platform was developed on a consortium blockchain architecture to address the problems universities face in storing and securing student data. The system provides a solution to facilitate students' registration, verification, and authenticity of educational documents. © 2021. by the authors. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The complexity of a supply chain makes product safety or quality issues extremely difficult to track, especially for the basic agricultural food supply chains of people's daily diets. The existing agricultural food supply chains present several major problems, such as numerous participants, inconvenient communication caused by long supply chain cycles, data distrust between participants and the centralized system. The emergence of blockchain technology effectively solves the pain-point problem existing in the traceability system of agricultural food supply chains. This paper proposes a framework based on the consortium and smart contracts to track and trace the workflow of agricultural food supply chains, implement traceability and shareability of supply chains, and break down the information islands between enterprises as much as possible to eliminate the need for the central institutions and agencies and improve the integrity of the transaction records, reliability and security. At the same time, farmers record details of the environment and crop growth data in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and store file IPFS hashes in smart contracts, which not only increases data security but also alleviates the blockchain storage explosion problem. This framework has been applied in Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. Although there are still many defects, the framework has successfully realized functions such as disintermediation and tracing of agricultural product information through QR codes. Thus, the framework proposed in this paper is of great significance and reference value for enterprises to ensure product quality and safety traceability. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging immature technology that disrupt many well established industries nowadays, like finance, supply chain, transportation, energy, official registries (identity, vehicles,..). In this contribution we present a smart contracts library, named Crypto-Spatial, written for the Ethereum Blockchain and designed to serve as a framework for geospatially enabled decentralized applications (dApps) development. The main goal of this work is to investigate the suitability of Blockchain technology for the storage, retrieval and processing of vector geospatial data. The design and the proof-of-concept implementation presented are both based on the Open Geospatial Consortium standards: Simple Feature Access, Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) and Well Known Binary (WKB). Also, the FOAM protocol concept of Crypto-Spatial Coordinate (CSC) was used to uniquely identify spatial features on the Blockchain immutable ledger. The design of the Crypto-Spatial framework was implemented as a set of smart contracts using the Solidity object oriented programming language. The implemented library was assessed toward Etheruem's best practices design patterns and known security issues (common attacks). Also, a generic architecture for geospatially enabled decentralized applications, combining blockchain and IPFS technologies, was proposed. Finally, a proof-of-concept was developed using the proposed approach which main purpose is to port the UN/FAO-SOLA to Blockchain techspace allowing more transparency and simplifying access to users communities. The smart contracts of this prototype are live on the Rinkeby testnet and the frontend is hosted on Github pages.

	abstract = {Ensuring a production-ready state of the application under development is the imminent feature of the Continuous Delivery (CD) approach. In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories. For the sake of verification, tests have been conducted for the electricity consumption and supply management system designed for prosumers of renewable energy. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Software development is a very broad activity that captures the entire life cycle of a software, which includes designing, programming, maintenance and so on. In this study, we focus on the maintenance-related concerns of the post-deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executed programs that run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they bring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software. According to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software maintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart contract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are the current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the answers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature review to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from 2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between academia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart contract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful responses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the first empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study can help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based projects, and we highlight some key future research directions to improve the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications bring evolved and intelligent services that can help improve users’ daily lives. These applications include home automation, health care, and smart agriculture. However, IoT development and adoption face various security and privacy challenges that need to be overcome. As a promising security paradigm, context-aware security enables one to enforce security and privacy mechanisms adaptively. Moreover, with the advancements in edge computing, context-aware security services can dynamically be placed close to a user’s location and enable the support of low latency communication and mobility. Therefore, the design of an adaptive and decentralized access control mechanism becomes a necessity. In this paper, we propose a decentralized context-aware authorization management as a service based on the blockchain. The proposed architecture extends the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework with blockchain technology and context-awareness capabilities. Instead of a classic Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth) access token, it uses a new contextual access token. The evaluation results show our proposition’s effectiveness and advantages in terms of usability, security, low latency, and energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Residential energy trading systems (RETS) enable homeowners with distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in virtualized energy markets that have the potential to reduce the peak demand of residential communities. Blockchains are key enablers of RETS, by virtue of providing a decentralized, self-governed network that mitigates concerns regarding privacy and transparency. However, more real-world case studies are needed to evaluate the techno-economic viability of blockchain-based RETS to improve their positive uptake. Thus, this article develops a permissioned blockchain-based RETS, which enables homeowners to select bidding strategies that consider the individual preferences of their DERs, and further evaluates the impact of the bidding strategies on reducing the peak demand of the community. The proposed system is implemented on the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric platform, where a decentralized ledger is used to store all energy bids, and a smart contract is used to execute a double auction mechanism and dispatch the homeowner DERs. The proposed system is validated by conducting simulations on a 8-home community using real-world data, and also by deploying the system to a Canadian microgrid, where the smart contract execution time is benchmarked. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system by achieving a peak demand reduction of up to 48 kW (62%), which leads to an average savings of $1.02 M for the distribution system operator by avoiding transformer upgrades. Also, the simulation results show that the execution time of the proposed smart contract is 17.12 seconds across 12 nodes, which is sufficient for RETS. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of a wide range of banking architectures, technologies, and applications made possible by the significant improvements in hardware, software, and networking technologies. Nowadays, innovative solutions are being developed by banks to leverage the benefits of blockchain, to improve their business agility and performance, and to make their business operations more efficient and secure. However, there are still cases where regular access to Internet is impossible or unreliable due to saturated networks or harsh environments, hence limiting the deployment of typical blockchain based solutions. In this context, an approach using a new connectivity technology is needed in order to increase mobile Internet services for any device to reach nearly 95% of the world population, instantly, simply by drawing on existing mobile phone networks, with no additional infrastructure development. We aim to give the user full bank access from their device, even if the device is not a smart one, using ordinary mobile phone networks. However, providing efficient and secure communications over lossy and low bandwidth networks remains a challenge. The main objective of this paper will be to design an end-to-end and low overhead secure solution for the communications between mobile devices and their corresponding remote application servers that using blockchain via ordinary mobile networks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology provides a private, secure, transparent decentralized exchange of data. Also, blockchain is not limited to a particular area, but it has a wide range of applications and can be integrated into a variety of Internet interactive systems. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain tracking, Electronic Health Records (EHR), digital forensics, identity management, trustless payments, and other key business elements will all benefit from its implementation. Next layer solutions such as Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, Cardano, and other Web 3.0 technologies provide developers versatility. Moreover, these platforms utilize smart contracts which are similar to standard, traditionalized software during development but offer key utilities to end-users such as online wallets, secure data with transparent rules. Blockchain is receiving a lot of attention in educational technology (EduTech) as it aims to achieve a more transparent and multipurpose educational system. In addition to smart contract technology which defines how data should be registered, gathered and processed, blockchain can be used as an IoT intermediary for mobile usage. Therefore, we implemented an educational learning platform powered by blockchain technology to examine feasibility in industry and academic environment. In essence, this is a web application which is adapted to mobile platform and connected to blockchain for crucial data exchanges. In this paper we want to emphasize the potential of blockchain technology in multiple sectors as well as the need to really understand the underlying principles which are allowing disruptability of traditional centralized software solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Load shedding is an established means of preventing system collapse under emergency conditions. An auctioned load shedding hierarchy method is proposed whereby participating parties bid on tokens (SALtoks) guaranteeing access to supply during load shedding. This method is based on the recently developed Self Assessed Licenses Sold via Auction paradigm developed. Under this paradigm, SALtoks are subject to taxes based on valuations, while also being subject to continuous auction. A case study is performed on a hypothetical island power system. Higher ranking SALtoks are held by larger consumers. The method is found to mitigate economic impacts by allowing industry to maintain supply during load shedding. Smaller consumers, while subject to more frequent interruptions, gain the public benefit of increased income from taxation. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts are immutable, public, and distributed. However, they are subject to many vulnerabilities stemming from coding errors made by developers. Seven cybersecurity incidents occurred in Ethereum smart contracts between 2016 and 2018, which led to financial losses estimated to be over US$ 289 million. Reentrancy vulnerability was the cause of two of these incidents, and the impacts went far beyond financial loss. Several reentrancy countermeasures are available, which are based on predefined patterns that are used to prevent vulnerability exploitation before the deployment of a smart contract; however, several limitations have been identified in these countermeasures. Motivated by all these issues, the objective of this article is to help developers improve the cybersecurity of smart contracts by proposing a solution that calculates the difference between the contract balance and the total balance of all participants in a smart contract before and after any operation in a transaction that changes its state. Proof-of-concept implementations show that this solution can provide a detection and prevention mechanism against reentrancy attacks during the execution of any smart contract. © Copyright © 2021 Alkhalifah, Ng, Watters and Kayes.},

This paper introduces a decentralized electronic bidding system based on blockchain and smart contract. The system uses blockchain to replace the traditional database and uses chaincode to process business logic. In data interaction, encryption techniques such as zero-knowledge proof based on graph isomorphism are used to improve privacy protection, which improves the anonymity of participants, the privacy of data transmission, and the traceability and verifiable of data. Compared with other electronic bidding systems, this system is more secure and efficient, and has the nature of anonymous operation, which fully protects the privacy information in the bidding process. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Power system reforms worldwide have commoditized electric energy, and thus the electricity market has been developed. With this, trading of electric energy takes place in various time-domains like the day ahead, real-time, etc. These transactions take place over the counter (OTC) or Power Exchange (Px), which provide the market participants with the required platform and payment security. The transactions on OTC and Px requires a third-party platform and guarantee for contract and settlement, there incurs overhead cost. Since electric energy is a fungible commodity, it can be transacted very well with the old system like barter. Energy Banking is one such mechanism wherein one utility supplies the energy to another utility that needs it more and, in leisure, the energy can then be provided back. The requisite security of the transactions can be provided by blockchain technology. Energy banking is presently being done only on a MW quantum basis with no price tag, despite the cost being dependent on the demand-supply ratio. To ensure energy banking transactions in real-time and free from the perils of financial settlements, this article suggests the use of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model of blockchain technology for executing Smart Contracts mutually agreed upon by both parties and avoiding third party overhead costs. © Authors retain all copyrights.},

	abstract = {Logging system activities are required to provide credibility and confidence in the systems used by an organization. Logs in computer systems must be secured from the root user so that they are true and fair. This paper introduces RootLogChain, a blockchain-based audit mechanism that is built upon a security protocol to create both a root user in a blockchain network and the first log; from there, all root events are stored as logs within a standard blockchain mechanism. RootLogChain provides security constructs so as to be deployed in a distributed context over a hostile environment, such as the internet. We have developed a prototype based on a microservice architecture, validating it by executing different stress proofs in two scenarios: one with compliant agents and the other without. In such scenarios, several compliant and non-compliant agents try to become a root and register the events within the blockchain. Non-compliant agents simulate eavesdropper entities that do not follow the rules of the protocol. Our experiments show that the mechanism guarantees the creation of one and only one root user, integrity, and authenticity of the transactions; it also stores all events generated by the root within a blockchain. In addition, for audit issues, the traceability of the transaction logs can be consulted by the root. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Modern blockchains support a variety of distributed applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts, which let users execute arbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency, contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work, we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract, one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The very nature of smart contracts and blockchain platforms, where program execution and storage are replicated across a large number of nodes, makes resource consumption analysis highly relevant. This has led to the development of analyzers for specific platforms and languages. However, blockchain platforms present significant variability in languages and cost models, as well as over time. Approaches that facilitate the quick development and adaptation of cost analyses are thus potentially attractive in this context. We explore the application of a generic approach and tool for cost analysis to the problem of static inference of gas consumption bounds in smart contracts. The approach is based on Parametric Resource Analysis, a method that simplifies the implementation of analyzers for inferring safe bounds on different resources and with different resource consumption models. In addition, to support different input languages, the approach also makes use of translation into a Horn clause-based intermediate representation. To assess practicality we develop an analyzer for the Tezos platform and its Michelson language. We argue that this approach offers a rapid, flexible, and effective method for the development of cost analyses for smart contracts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid levels of economic development, there have been more and more problems in property inheritance and distribution. In today’s society, people still have many taboos when writing a will. Writing a will not only involves various laws and regulations but also costs a lot of money and time, which can be daunting. However, with the development of the Inter-net, blockchain technology has gradually been applied to many applications. Blockchain technology uses consensus algorithms to ensure consistency and records transaction information in blocks to ensure the effectiveness of transactions. In this paper, we use the cryptography mechanism to propose an online will system based on blockchain and smart contract technology. The architecture considers effectiveness and cost reduction. By combining this with blockchain technology, will assets are saved in blocks, which provides comprehensive will security and non-tamperable security protection. In addition, combined with a smart contract, it realizes the method of automatic property distribution. At the same time, this mechanism also proposes an arbitration solution when there are disputes over wills, and ensures the integrity of data, public verifiability, unforgeability, nonre-pudiation, irreversibility of information, and the ability to resist counterfeiting attacks. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain system for telemedicine data storage. Telemedicine is one of the currently developing digital technologies in the health and medical sectors. Telemedicine can be more efficient when seeking treatment because patients do not need to see a doctor face to face. When using blockchain technology, the stored data becomes more transparent for each node in the blockchain network but has verification on every transaction which takes time and gas costs. However, telemedicine has several risks and problems, one of which is long data storage process time because there must be a verification process first to ensure data security. Another problem faced is the issue of the gas fee of the blockchain telemedicine system which is billed in every data storage transaction. In this study, a blockchain system was introduced for managing and securing databases on telemedicine. The implementation of this blockchain system was carried out on a website page that can add data to and retrieve data from the blockchain system. The results of this study showed that blockchain was successfully implemented to store telemedicine data with Ethereum. The analysis in this paper refers to the set and gets functions. The set function is used to send data to the blockchain, and the get function is used to retrieve data from the blockchain. From testing, the Get function has a much faster execution time than the Set function because the Get function does not require verification to retrieve its data. In the iterations carried out—namely 1, 10, and 100—the longest time on average was at 100 iterations when compared to the other iterations. In the tests carried out, the more characters that were stored, the more gas costs must be paid. In the tests, the percentage increase in costs was 0.34% per character. © 2021},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has recently emerged as a worldwide health emergency that necessitates coordinated international measures. To contain the virus's spread, governments and health organisations raced to develop vaccines that would lower Covid-19 morbidity, relieve pressure on healthcare systems, and allow economies to open. Following the COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccination certificate has been adopted to help the authorities formulate policies by controlling cross-border travelling. To address serious privacy concerns and eliminate the need for third parties to retain the trust and govern user data, in this paper, we leverage blockchain technologies in developing a secure and verifiable vaccination certificate. Our approach has the advantage of utilising a hybrid approach that implements different advanced technologies, such as the self-sovereignty concept, smart contracts and interPlanetary File System (IPFS). We rely on verifiable credentials paired with smart contracts to make decisions about who can access the system and provide on-chain verification and validation of the user and issuer DIDs. The approach was further analysed, with a focus on performance and security. Our analysis shows that our solution satisfies the security requirements for immunisation certificates.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain provides an immutable distributed ledger for storing transactions. One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Ethereum blockchain enables executing and recording smart contracts. The smart contracts can facilitate, verify, and implement the negotiation between multiple parties, also guaranteeing transactions without a traditional legal entity. Many tools supporting the smart contracts development in different areas are flourishing because in Ethereum blockchain valuable assets are often involved. Some of the tools help the developer to find security vulnerabilities via static and/or dynamic analysis or to reduce the Gas fees consumption. Despite the plethora of such tools, there is no tool supporting smart contracts evaluation and analysis via a graphical representation for expert developers.The paper embraces this way to facilitate the developers' analysis activity, by proposing a graphical representation model to visualize smart contract source code. The paper makes available a tool via a web interface, which accepts the smart contract address as an input and produces a graphical representation of the smart contract as an output. The graphical representation can help developers to better understand the structure of smart contracts and share it with other developers. Moreover, some metrics, such as the relations among smart contracts, are easier to be understood via "spatial"than "tabular"representation. Indeed, representing smart contracts' metrics via visual representation facilitates the developers, who are used to analyse the source code by directly inspecting it or using other tools that provide the metrics in a table format. Finally, the paper provides detailed data regarding a smart contract to the developers and proposes a graphical representation of the smart contracts without obscuration of details, also highlighting areas of the code that are possibly too big in size and/or too complex via a diagram displaying their connections. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, data auditing is an important means to check the integrity of the data stored on the cloud. Existing data auditing schemes have done a lot of work in terms of functionality, implementation, and security. As we can see, all of these schemes are based on the auditing framework proposed by Ateniese et al., which uses random sampling to probabilistically check whether the data is integrity or not. But multiple repeated sampling may lead to an intersection between the challenge sets selected each time, reducing the probability of detection, and the time for detecting corrupted blocks will be indefinite. If the corrupted data is not found for a long time, the data remedial measures will become invalid, resulting in permanent data loss. To address the above problem, we designed an efficient sampling verification algorithm. Based on this algorithm, the auditing scheme is further optimized, and a dynamic auditing function has been developed for the scheme to facilitate data owners to update data. Through the security analysis, our scheme is soundness. The experiment shows that our sampling verification can detect corrupted blocks faster than other auditing schemes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of the Energy Internet and the support of the subsidy policies of various countries, Electric Vehicles(EVs) have ushered in a golden development period. However, the development of EVs needs to solve the problems of insufficient charging piles(CPs) and difficulty in finding CPs. In order to solve the problem of difficult charging of EVs, the concept of shared charging came into being, in which idle CPs or private CPs are shared to meet the charging needs of more people and improve the utilization rate of CPs. However, the shared charging scheme implemented by third-party platforms faces the issue of trust lacking. This paper proposes a blockchain architecture for shared charging, which can use the blockchain to build a trust environment involving private pile owners, charging pile(CP) operators, Electric Vehicle(EV) users, etc. The blockchain architecture also contains the block structure where pointer was added for quick search, contract content that can automatically execute multi-party contracts to achieve secure computing and reputation-based incentive mechanism to provide high-quality charging services in detail. This architecture establishes the multi-party trust environment for shared charging from three aspects: secure storage, secure computing, and secure incentives. © 2021},

To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure automated payment system using contract wallets. This method ensures the security of cryptographic assets even if the private key is stolen. Secure automated payments are enabled by issuing transactions from IoT devices and using internal transactions to link contract wallets and smart contracts that handle the payment of cryptographic assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated on the Ethereum blockchain as a proof of concept, and the cost of gas is measured. © 2021 Shinya Haga and Kazumasa Omote.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.},

The Agile methods, proven practices enabling to develop software in presence of changing requirements, could be a means for managing uncertainty. The main goals of this work are to understand software engineering activities related to ICOs, recognize the ICOs developed using Agile methods, and make a comparison between ICOs and Agile ICOs. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis of Agile ICOs concerning project planning, software development, and code features. Our work shows that the roles of the people involved in an ICO can be compared to the typical roles of the SCRUM methodology. The majority of Agile ICOs use tool of testing before storing smart contract on blockchain. Finally, the application of volumetric and complexity software metrics shows that the files of Agile ICOs is on average shorter and less complex than in other smart contracts. © 2018 by the authors.},

A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. This paper addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly. © 2013 IEEE.},

The focus here is particularly on introducing and bringing together selected individual components of the solution to achieve a synergistic effect in expanding the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions of this paper include: (i) proposing a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) proposing a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) proposing a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security, and applying this method both in the context of method (i) and method (ii); and (iv) proposing the use of distributed hash tables DHT in building secure and optimized repositories in the context of method (i) and in the context method (ii), where the former involves a DHT repository of smart contracts and the latter involves a DHT repository of entities underlying smart contracts that are being exchanged among different smart contracts and subcontracts. The smart-contract focused methods introduced in this paper contribute to the overall goal towards a sustainable adaptive mechanism for processing evolving volumes, versatility, and complexity of blockchain transactions, traffic, and services. Blockchain-enabled services are efficient, secure, automated, and allowing worldwide distribution of resources. They present a more efficient and sustainable alternative to current service infrastructures within a range of domains, particularly the legal and financial domains. They also set a sustainable infrastructure for emerging Internet-of-things services. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms are currently one of the hottest topics in technology. Although most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology. The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts is Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help to mature the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 40 thousand Solidity source files with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, neither overly complex nor coupled too much, do not rely heavily on inheritance, and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 85% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities. © 2019 by the author.},

Timely and accurate testing is paramount to an effective response to this pandemic as it helps identify infections and therefore mitigate (isolate/cure) them. In this paper, we investigate this challenge and contribute by presenting a blockchain-based solution that incorporates self-sovereign identity, re-encryption proxies, and decentralized storage, such as the interplanetary file systems (IPFS). Our solution implements digital medical passports (DMP) and immunity certificates for COVID-19 test-takers. We present smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain written and tested successfully to maintain a digital medical identity for test-takers that help in a prompt trusted response directly by the relevant medical authorities. We reduce the response time of the medical facilities, alleviate the spread of false information by using immutable trusted blockchain, and curb the spread of the disease through DMP. We present a detailed description of the system design, development, and evaluation (cost and security analysis) for the proposed solution. Since our code leverages the use of the on-chain events, the cost of our design is almost negligible. We have made our smart contract codes publicly available on Github.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To date, cash on delivery (COD) is one of the most popular payment methods in developing countries thanks to the blossom of customer-to-customer e-commerce. With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people's daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue. In particular, we propose a multi-session mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and transparent across delivering sessions in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism ensure the efficiency of delivering process. The authors release our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. We conclude that the integration of multi-session mechanism and blockchain technology will cause significant efficiency across several disciplines. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

	abstract = {The combination of renewable energy sources and prosumer-based smart grid is a sustainable solution to cater to the problem of energy demand management. A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

We show that payments are guaranteed in PERS if the Single Circulation Source principle is adopted (i.e., PG-PERS). Compared to the existing deposit-based exchange rate schemes, PG-PERS is a scheme that requires no initial key token deposit and its price changes have relatively stable rates especially in extreme cases. As an application of PG-PERS, we present a token swap service, called Fanco Swap, for swapping the ERC20 token used on aFan, an incentivized social media platform, and Ether coin. We also cover several practical issues such as precision and computation cost problems and the solutions to them, which adopted in the implementation of Fanco Swap. The paper contains a comprehensive survey on existing cryptocurrency exchange services and their pricing mechanism, followed by a formal development of the proposed exchange rate scheme and its comparison with one of the most representative existing exchange rate schemes. © 2020 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The globalized production and the distribution of agriculture production bring a renewed focus on the safety, quality, and the validation of several important criteria in agriculture and food supply chains. The growing number of issues related to food safety and contamination risks has established an immense need for effective traceability solution that acts as an essential quality management tool ensuring adequate safety of products in the agricultural supply chain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can provide an innovative solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. Today's agricultural supply chains are complex ecosystem involving several stakeholders making it cumbersome to validate several important criteria such as country of origin, stages in crop development, conformance to quality standards, and monitor yields. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts efficiently perform business transactions for soybean tracking and traceability across the agricultural supply chain. Our proposed solution eliminates the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transactions records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security. The proposed solution focuses on the utilization of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions among all the participants involved within the supply chain ecosystem. All transactions are recorded and stored in the blockchain's immutable ledger with links to a decentralized file system (IPFS) and thus providing to all a high level of transparency and traceability into the supply chain ecosystem in a secure, trusted, reliable, and efficient manner. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today's programmable blockchains, smart contracts are limited to being deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. Their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners.We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it’s hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Trading cryptocurrency on current digital exchange platforms is a trust-based process, where the parties involved in the exchange have to fully trust the service provider. As it has been proven several times, this could lead to funds being stolen, either due to malicious service providers that simply disappear or due to hacks that these platforms might suffer. In this work, we propose and develop a decentralised exchange solution based on smart contracts running on the Ethereum network that is open, verifiable, and does not require trust. The platform enables two parties to trade different currencies, limited to Ethereum and Bitcoin in the current status of the system. A smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, functions as an escrow, which holds a user’s funds until a verified transaction has been made by the other party. To make the smart contract able to detect a Bitcoin transfer, we implement our solution by utilising an oracle. We define the system architecture and implement a working platform, which we test in a model scenario, successfully exchanging Bitcoin and Ether on the blockchain test networks. We conclude the paper identifying possible challenges and threats to such a system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue for the role of the blockchain, i.e., distributed ledger technology, in building innovative business models, including machine money, autonomous economic agents and decentralised organisations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things. Findings: The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology’s adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies. Originality/value: The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Especially with the advanced development of digital smart devices and the internet, several forms of the mutual economy have been advanced in accord with the need for sharing of separate income. Shareable commodity and digital content are also seeking to utilize. When digital content is used as a sharing economy, various possible threats may arise in the course of transactions, the potential for theft, alteration, and hacking of contents. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of Blockchain. Blockchain promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. In this research, we proposed a content protection and transaction method using Blockchain Ethereum Technology. The encryption algorithm is incorporated in proposed system to make transparent transactions and it is also implemented on content itself to prevent from smart forgery and hacking. The experimental results signify that the proposed method has strong potential to enhance transactions transparency by minimizing the security threats in digital content transactions. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rise of programmable open distributed consensus platforms based on the blockchain technology has aroused a lot of interest in replicated stateful computations, aka smart contracts. As blockchains are used predominantly in financial applications, smart contracts frequently manage millions of dollars worth of virtual coins. Since smart contracts cannot be updated once deployed, the ability to reason about their correctness becomes a critical task. Yet, the de facto implementation standard, pioneered by the Ethereum platform, dictates smart contracts to be deployed in a low-level language, which renders independent audit and formal verification of deployed code infeasible in practice. We report an ongoing experiment held with an industrial blockchain vendor on designing, evaluating, and deploying Scilla, a new programming language for safe smart contracts. Scilla is positioned as an intermediate-level language, suitable to serve as a compilation target and also as an independent programming framework. Taking System F as a foundational calculus, Scilla offers strong safety guarantees by means of type soundness. It provides a clean separation between pure computational, state-manipulating, and communication aspects of smart contracts, avoiding many known pitfalls due to execution in a byzantine environment. We describe the motivation, design principles, and semantics of Scilla, and we report on Scilla use cases provided by the developer community. Finally, we present a framework for lightweight verification of Scilla programs, and showcase it with two domain-specific analyses on a suite of real-world use cases. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Blockchain technology enables distributed power and embedded security. As such, Blockchain is regarded as an innovative, general purpose technology, offering new ways of organization in many domains, including e-government for transactions and information exchange. However, due to its very characteristics of peer to peer information exchange, its distributed nature, the still developing technology, the involvement of new actors, roles, etc., the implementation of blockchain applications raise issues that need governance attention. BC initiatives have implications for citizen trust, privacy, inclusion and participation. Governmental organizations need a thorough understanding of the BC design principles, the possible applications in the domain of e-government and the exploration of governance mechanisms to deal with the limitations and challenges of the BC technology when used in a myriad of sectors, ranging from the financial and business sector to the social domains of healthcare and education. In this panel we explore the impact of block chain technology on all levels of government and create an awareness of effects or applications in society that raise governance issues. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record.

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that reside within decentralized blockchains and are executed pursuant to triggered instructions. A smart contract acts in a similar way to a traditional agreement but negates the necessity for the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are capable of initiating their commands automatically, thus eliminating the involvement of a regulatory body. As a consequence of blockchain's immutable feature, smart contracts are developed in a manner that is distinct from traditional software. Once deployed to the blockchain, a smart contract cannot be modified or updated for security patches, thus encouraging developers to implement strong security strategies before deployment in order to avoid potential exploitation at a later time. However, the most recent dreadful attacks and the multifarious existing vulnerabilities which result as a consequence of the absence of security patches have challenged the sustainability of this technology. Attacks such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack and the Parity Wallet hack have cost millions of dollars simply as a consequence of naïve bugs in the smart contract code. In this paper, we classify blockchain exploitation techniques into 4 categories based on the attack rationale; attacking consensus protocols, bugs in the smart contract, malware running in the operating system, and fraudulent users. We then focus on smart contract vulnerabilities, analyzing the 7 most important attack techniques to determine the real impact on smart contract technology. We reveal that even adopting the 10 most widely used tools to detect smart contract vulnerabilities, these still contain known vulnerabilities, providing a dangerously false sense of security. We conclude the paper with a discussion about recommendations and future research lines to progress towards a secure smart contract solution. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A public private partnership (PPP) is an agreement between a public and a private party to achieve a strategic objective. The PPP model is based on three principles: risk allocation and transfer, affordability, and value for money. Traditionally, PPPs have been leveraged for hard service development such as infrastructure development. The advancement of technology within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has created new opportunities and risks for PPPs as important mechanisms for the promotion of development. The 4IR has implications for government service delivery, which have brought about an increased demand for service delivery innovation and the development of information and communications technology (ICT). Although PPPs have traditionally focused on hard services, it is important to consider PPPs for soft service delivery. It is therefore necessary to rethink the role of the PPP model as an alternative service delivery mechanism. The aim of this article is to discuss risk allocation in ICT PPPs. The research approach is qualitative in nature. The research method is based on a desktop analysis of literature and secondary data utilising unobtrusive research techniques such as conceptual and documentary analyses. The article identified various risks and opportunities for PPPs for service delivery innovation. These partnerships are often faced with high levels of uncertainty in terms of funding, level of stakeholder commitment, and complex relationships. Other risks include vendor financing, market risk, intellectual property (IP) risk, data governance, and regulatory risk. The deployment of ICT can reinforce and expand PPPs beyond all previous limitations and boundaries. This research makes proposals for good practices for risk allocation in ICT PPPs. © 2020, Social Sciences Research Society.},

	abstract = {A supply chain consists of many stakeholders such as suppliers, carriers and customers. It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a 'one trusted ledger' that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our findings, one potential impact of deploying blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain can obtain verified information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research, we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conflict of interests. Future work such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying this technology within a supply chain. Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emerging blockchain technology has enabled various decentralised applications in a trustless environment without relying on a trusted intermediary. It is expected as a promising solution to tackle sophisticated challenges on personal data management, thanks to its advanced features such as immutability, decentralisation and transparency. Although certain approaches have been proposed to address technical difficulties in personal data management; most of them only provided preliminary methodological exploration. Alarmingly, when utilising Blockchain for developing a personal data management system, fictions have occurred in existing approaches and been promulgated in the literature. Such fictions are theoretically doable; however, by thoroughly breaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we clarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly inefficient due to the natural limitations of the blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution in which such fictions are reduced by designing a novel system architecture with a blockchain-based 'proof of permission' protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing service built on top of a public blockchain platform. We believe that our research resolves existing ambiguity and take a step further on providing a practically feasible solution for decentralised personal data management. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs, deployed on a peer-to-peer network and executed in a consensus-based fashion. Their bytecode is public, immutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As smart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are attractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully been exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses. The correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first approaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in formal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze individual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e., calls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the actual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic execution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported by annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In contrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional, inter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode with a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While the analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we analyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from unreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to handle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain its implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and demonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Solidity is a language used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are embedded procedures stored with the data they act upon. Debugging smart contracts is a really difficult task since once deployed, the code cannot be reexecuted and inspecting a simple attribute is not easily possible because data is encoded. In this paper, we address the lack of inspectability of a deployed contract by analyzing contract state using decompilation techniques driven by the contract structure definition. Our solution, SmartInspect, also uses a mirror-based architecture to represent locally object responsible for the interpretation of the contract state. SmartInspect allows contract developers to better visualize and understand the contract stored state without needing to redeploy, nor develop any ad-hoc code. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decentralised (on-blockchain) and centralised (off-blockchain) platforms are available for the implementation of smart contracts. However, none of the two alternatives can individually provide the services and quality of services (QoS) imposed on smart contracts involved in a large class of applications. The reason is that blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Likewise, off-blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks emerging from their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several applications, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on and off-blockchain platforms are more adequate. Developers that informatively choose between the three alternatives are likely to implement smart contracts that deliver the expected QoS. Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap and as a proof of concept, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. We show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off-blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the rinkeby ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Interconnected microgrids are becoming a building block in smart systems. Initiating secure and efficient energy trading mechanisms among networked microgrids for reliability and economic mutual benefits have become a crucial task. Recently, integrating blockchain technologies into the energy sector have gained significant amount of interest, e.g. transactive grid. This paper proposes a two-layer secured smart contract-based energy trading mechanism to allow microgrids to establish coalitions, adjust the electricity-trading price, and achieve transparent and decentralized secure transactions without intervention of a third trusted party. Since reliability benefits are main drivers of microgrids operation in islanded mode, a new decentralized smart contract based-energy trading model for islanded networked microgrids is proposed in the first layer with an objective to achieve demand generation balance. In the second layer, and to achieve a higher security, all executed contracts are verified and saved in a blockchain based on a new developed two-phase consensus method that utilizes practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), and a modified Proof of Stake (PoS). Simulations are conducted in Python environment to validate the proposed energy trading model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most carbon Emission Trading Systems (ETS) rely on a centralized system to manage the transactional tasks, and are vulnerable to security threats. This article proposes a Blockchain-enabled Distributed ETS (BD-ETS) to improve the security and efficiency of the system. The BD-ETS transforms the centralized Carbon Emissions Permit (CEP) trading mode to a distributed trading system in which the trading mode is based on a smart contract performed in Hyperledger Fabric. In a smart contract, every transaction considers both the offer price and reputation value of the emitting enterprises. The voting power of the emitting enterprise is determined by its reputation value, which stems from their contributions to carbon emission reduction. To achieve consistency of every node in the CEP transactions, we propose a Delegated Proof of Reputation (DPoR) consensus mechanism. Compared to the enhanced Delegated Proof of Stake, the DPoR decreases the attack intention of malicious enterprises and performs better in finding malicious miners faster, thus improving the security of the BD-ETS. A case study and numerical simulations are developed to illustrate how the CEP trading functions, and to validate the DPoR mechanism.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Energy (IoE) provides an effective networking technology for distributed green energy, which allows the connection of energy anywhere at any time. As an important part of the IoE, electric vehicles (EVs), and charging pile management are of great significance to the development of the IoE industry. Previous work has mainly focused on network performance optimization for its management, and few studies have considered the security of the management between EVs and charging piles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized security model based on the lightning network and smart contract in the blockchain ecosystem; this proposed model is called the lightning network and smart contract (LNSC). The overall model involves registration, scheduling, authentication, and charging phases. The new proposed security model can be easily integrated with current scheduling mechanisms to enhance the security of trading between EVs and charging piles. Experimental results according to a realistic infrastructure are presented in this paper. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance vehicle security. Different performances of LNSC-based scheduling strategies are also presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Albeit the primary usage of Bitcoin is to exchange currency, its blockchain and consensus mechanism can also be exploited to securely execute some forms of smart contracts. These are agreements among mutually distrusting parties, which can be automatically enforced without resorting to a trusted intermediary. Over the last few years a variety of smart contracts for Bitcoin have been proposed, both by the academic community and by that of developers. However, the heterogeneity in their treatment, the informal (often incomplete or imprecise) descriptions, and the use of poorly documented Bitcoin features, pose obstacles to the research. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of smart contracts on Bitcoin, in a uniform framework. Our treatment is based on a new formal specification language for smart contracts, which also helps us to highlight some subtleties in existing informal descriptions, making a step towards automatic verification. We discuss some obstacles to the diffusion of smart contracts on Bitcoin, and we identify the most promising open research challenges. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is getting out of its infancy, into full maturity, and tends to be developed in an explosively rapid way, with more and more data transmitted and processed. As a result, the ability to manage devices deployed worldwide has been given more and advanced requirements in practical application performances. Most existing IoT platforms are highly centralized architectures, which suffer from various technical limitations, such as a cyber-attack and single point of failure. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data accessing, while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated IoT platform using blockchain technology to guarantee sensing data integrity. The aim of this platform is to afford the device owner a practical application that provides a comprehensive, immutable log and allows easy access to their devices deployed in different domains. It also provides characteristics of general IoT systems, allows for real-time monitoring, and control between the end user and device. The business logic of the application is defined by the smart contract, which contains rules and conditions. The proposed approach is backed by a proof of concept implementation in realistic IoT scenarios, utilizing Raspberry Pi devices and a permissioned network called Hyperledger Fabric. Lastly, a benchmark study using various performance metrics is made to highlight the significance of the proposed work. The analysis results indicate that the designed platform is suitable for the resource-constrained IoT architecture and is scalable to be extended in various IoT scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, the security of the blockchain smart contracts is among the most popular contemporary research topics. To improve the theorem-proving technology in this field, we are developing an extensible hybrid verification proof engine, denoted as FEther, for Ethereum smart contract verification. Based on Lolisa, which is a large subset of solidity mechanized in Coq, FEther guarantees the consistency between smart contracts and its formal model. Combining symbolic execution with higher order logic theorem-proving, FEther contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. Besides, in FEther, the verified code segments also can be reused to assist in the verification of other properties. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. The execution efficiency of FEther has far exceeded that of the interpreters that are developed in Coq in accordance with the standard tutorial. To the best of our knowledge, FEther is the first definitional interpreter of the solidity language in Coq. © 2019 IEEE.},

Electronic voting and electronic bidding systems can be used to reduce costs, and many new systems have been introduced. However, most systems require a powerful and trusted third party to guarantee system integrity and security. With developments in blockchain technology, research has begun to highlight the core concept of decentralization. In this study, we introduce the first decentralized electronic voting and bidding systems based on a blockchain and smart contract. We also use cryptographic techniques such as oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryptions to improve privacy protection. Our proposed systems allow voters and bidders to participate in the opening phase and improve participant anonymity, the privacy of data transmission, and data reliability and verifiability. Moreover, compared with other electronic voting and bidding systems, our systems are safer and more efficient. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming. Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming. The paper offers a case study to design contracts by users. The designed contracts were validated on the existing system to implement the food trading and traders' credit evaluation. The experimental results show that the designed smart contracts achieve good integration with the existing system and they can be deployed and compiled successfully. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin continues to get more and more attention from the media, mainly because of the volatility of its value and insignificantly associated with the technological innovation. This cryptocurrency is supported by an immutable database and is distributed throughout a network of thousands of nodes, known as Blockchain. One way to ensure that all the concepts behind the Blockchain technology and infrastructure are seized is to conduct the development of one of the most popular context applications for it: a wallet for well-known cryptocurrencies. Yet Another Bitcoin Wallet (YABW) is a hybrid application available for both Android and iOS, which was developed with the Ionic and Angular frameworks. This application communicates with Bitcoin Blockchain to send, receive and store bitcoins; provides a set of features focused on security and user experience, and is available on the Play Store and Apple Store. A rather relevant issue that is becoming a major subject of current research is the application of the Blockchain infrastructure to other contexts that are neither directly connected to cryptocurrencies, nor are finance related. The implementation of a proof-of-concept application proposes the use of a blockchain for a specific case study: the exchange of meal vouchers of an institution amongst students. This is achieved using the decentralized platform Ethereum, which allows us to create a Smart Contract using the Solidity programming language to create a token that follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), the ERC-20 standard and represents the meal vouchers. This second application uses the architecture defined for YABW, reusing major components and custom developing specific modules to enhance the required features. There is still a lot of research to be done on the non-financial applicability of the Blockchain infrastructure and technology, but for the moment, we have left further evidence that it is possible and is a relative straight-forward process to accomplish from the technological perspective. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are executable programs that enable the building of a programmable trust mechanism between multiple entities without the need of a trusted third-party. At the time of this writing, there were over 10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage. Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are essential if smart contracts are to gain mainstream acceptance. Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions of the contract-under-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart contracts. In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic. © 2019 IEEE.},

Temporary workers play therefore, an important role in many companies, but this kind of activity is subject to a special form of legal protections and many aspects and risks must be taken into account for both employers and employees. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all actors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with the fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a protection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system wants to assist the employer in processing contracts with a fully automated and fast procedure. To resolve these problems, we propose the D-ES (Decentralized Employment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state system. Then we describe the enabling technology that makes us able to realize the D-ES. In fact, we propose the implementation of a DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) based system, consisting in a blockchain system and of a web-based environment. Thanks to the decentralized application platforms that makes us able to develop smart contracts. We define a discrete event control system that works inside the blockchain.

	abstract = {Smart contract transactions demonstrate issues of performance and correctness that application programmers must work around. Although the blockchain consensus mechanism approaches ACID compliance, use cases that rely on frequent state changes are impractical due to the block publishing interval of O(10^1) seconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state transitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not match program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is committed. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data structure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm, Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a Read-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the pending transaction pool. The transaction order derived from the DAG is used to provide a Read-Uncommitted view of the data for new transactions, which enter the DAG as they are received. An implementation of HMS is provided, interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart contracts. Over a wide range of transaction mixes, HMS is demonstrated to improve throughput. A side product of the implementation is a new technique, Runtime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate with external data services before submitting a transaction. RAA has use cases beyond HMS and can serve as a lightweight replacement for blockchain oracles. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is a kind of blockchain platform where developers may develop and run programs called smart contracts. It inherently relies on gas consumption within a specified allowance to constrain code execution, making every instruction along an execution path to be a location for raising an exception. In this paper, we present GasFuzzer, the first work in exploring the effects of gas allowance manipulation to expose gas-oriented exception security vulnerabilities. GasFuzzer consists of two phases. The first phase introduces a gas-greedy strategy to favor transactions having higher gas consumption for mutation to obtain test transactions with different gas consumptions. The second phase introduces a novel notion of fractional gas consumption coverage and a novel gas-leveling strategy. It applies them to mutate the gas allowances of some of these transactions resulting in the highest gas consumptions produced in the first phase followed by applying these allowance-mutated transactions together with those which remained non-mutated to fuzz test the smart contract. We report an evaluation of GasFuzzer via an experiment on 3170 real-world smart contracts deployed on the public Ethereum Blockchain between October 2017 and July 2019. The findings show that GasFuzzer with gas-greedy strategy can detect more Exceptions Disorder kind of security vulnerabilities (7 more cases) than the previous state-of-the-art black-box fuzzer, and GasFuzzer with gas-leveling strategy and gas coverage criterion can detect 6 additional cases of Exceptions Disorder security vulnerabilities, which is significant. © 2013 IEEE.},

We examined the collected data computing different statistics on naming policies, smart contract ether balance, number of smart contract transactions, functions, and other quantities characterizing the use and purpose of smart contracts. We found that the number of transactions and the balances follow power-law distributions and the software code metrics display, on average, values lower than corresponding metrics in standard software but have high variances. Focusing the attention on the 20 smart contracts with the topmost number of transactions, we found that most of them represent financial smart contracts and some of them have peculiar software development stories behind them. The results show that blockchain software is rapidly changing and evolving and it is no longer devoted only to cryptovalues applications but to general purpose computation. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The second generation of blockchain represented by smart contracts has been developing vigorously in recent years. However, frequent smart contract vulnerability incidents pose a serious risk to blockchain ecosystem security. Since current symbol execution tools often fall into path explosion and thus lead to inefficient detection, this paper expands Mythril's framework to optimize its performance. Firstly, it finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally, it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000 smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time consumption by around 35% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not actually cause financial losses. But the proposed method only concentrates on code regions related to transfer of funds, so it can reduce the false alarm rate to some extent. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems which utilize the human intelligence to solve complex tasks have gained considerable interest and adoption in recent years. However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users' privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system. © 2018 IEEE.},

The system is highly redundant and distributed, making it very difficult for fraudulent financial transactions. While cryptocurrencies might be the most well-known use case of blockchain technology, it is wrong to assume that this technology is restricted to the financial area. Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared - smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity. In this article, we aim to discuss how blockchain and smart contracts may be used together in order to improve organizational operations. More specifically, we demonstrate how these technologies might be used to develop a solution that avoids certain types of fraud in the area of vehicle insurance. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {A novel Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading scheme for a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is proposed by using Smart Contracts on Ethereum Blockchain Platform. The P2P energy trading is the recent trend the power society is keen to adopt carrying out several trial projects as it eases to generate and share the renewable energy sources in a distributed manner inside local community. Blockchain and smart contracts are the up-and-coming phenomena in the scene of the information technology used to be considered as the cutting-edge research topics in power systems. Earlier works on P2P energy trading including and excluding blockchain technology were focused mainly on the optimization algorithm, Information and Communication Technology, and Internet of Things. Therefore, the financial aspects of P2P trading in a VPP framework is focused and in that regard a P2P energy trading mechanism and bidding platform are developed. The proposed scheme is based on public blockchain network and auction is operated by smart contract addressing both cost and security concerns. The smart contract implementation and execution in a VPP framework including bidding, withdrawal, and control modules developments are the salient feature of this work. The proposed architecture is validated using realistic data with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment of Ropsten Test Network.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been developed for more than ten years and has become a trend in various industries. As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At a time when the digital economy is emerging, the preservation and multiplication of intellectual capital, which is currently a key factor in social development, are paramount. The national economy’s orientation toward the use of modern achievements of the digital industry will contribute to a faster transition to the global information society. Digitalization of education will make it possible to use the latest scientific achievements for the development of other areas of life in society. This study presents a model that applies distributed registry technologies based on blockchains and smart contracts for the reliable storage and efficient use of date relating to the population’s professional competencies. This model aims to create a unified information environment for interaction between all the actors of the economic system. The authors developed the model for registering professional competencies of the population and their developmental paths based on modern digital technologies. We substantiate the efficiency and security assured by blockchain technology for information storage and transmission. Educational institutions of all levels, governmental authorities controlling education, and people taking part in the educational process are the basic actors of the system presented. The proposed model presents the educational level and professional skills of each registered person as an education index (EI), which keeps track of all educational achievements and professional competencies of the participant over their lifetime. When calculating the EI, the authors also propose to consider ratings of the educational institutions responsible for the participant’s professional skills. The implementation of the EI will significantly simplify the process of employing graduates from various educational institutions, as well as the college admissions process. In addition, analytic tools could be used to create ratings of colleges, school departments, and even specific teachers. The registry of professional competencies we developed is directed at the processing and storage of large volumes of data (Big Data). In the future, this will allow us to open access to the registry to employers, pension insurance funds, and other state authorities that require complete and reliable personal data. © 2020 Business Informatics.

Using three case studies, this paper shows how different tasks give rise to, and benefit from, specialised methodologies. These case studies also highlight a number of challenges and opportunities, and demonstrate how a flexible research approach can increase efficiency and generate findings that are likely to influence blockchain standardisation at a global level. Case Study 1 describes our research into the legal status of smart contracts and the challenge of delivering clear findings about unclear subject matter. Case Study 2, which involved examining the sufficiency of existing regulatory frameworks in the supply chain and trade facilitation context, illustrates how rigid formatting specifications can impact the content of findings. In contrast, Case Study 3 concerns a project to incorporate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into new and existing Standards and shows how researchers’ knowledge can be harnessed as a valuable source of information in its own right.

	abstract = {Data are becoming the cornerstone of many businesses and entire systems infrastructure. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are no different. The ability of intelligent vehicles and devices to acquire and share environmental measurements in the form of data is leading to the creation of smart services for the benefit of individuals. In this paper, we present a system architecture to promote the development of ITS using distributed ledgers and related technologies. Thanks to these, it becomes possible to create, store and share data generated by users through the sensors on their devices or vehicles, while on the move. We propose an architecture based on Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) to offer features such as immutability, traceability and verifiability of data. IOTA, a promising DLT for IoT, is used together with Decentralized File Storages (DFSes) to store and certify data (and their related metadata) coming from vehicles or by the users' devices themselves (smartphones). Ethereum is then exploited as the smart contract platform that coordinates the data sharing through access control mechanisms. Privacy guarantees are provided by the usage of distributed key management systems and Zero Knowledge Proof. We provide experimental results of a testbed based on real traces, in order to understand if DLT and DFS technologies are ready to support complex services, such as those that pertain to ITS. Results clearly show that, while the viability of the proposal cannot be rejected, further work is needed on the responsiveness of DLT infrastructures. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is growing fast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and the Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing contracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2018.},

	abstract = {Supply chain networks have grown in complexity and size due to increased globalization leading to a variety of challenges and opportunities for improvement. Optimizing inventory levels and adjusting replenishment policies have significant effects on the operational performance and profitability of supply chains. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is a mutually beneficial arrangement between supplier and buyer, where the supplier is responsible for making inventory and replenishment decisions based on buyers' inventory status. Potential benefits of VMI include reducing inventories, enabling information sharing, eliminating safety stock, and reducing purchasing related costs across the supply chain. In today's supply chains, VMI operations face critical challenges related to data integrity, transparency, traceability, and single point of failure due to its centralized architecture. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology for VMI operations in a supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform VMI supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment. We present cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution to VMI operations in supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Solidity is a widely used scripting language for developing smart contracts in blockchain applications. Quality assurance of Solidity contracts is of critical importance because bugs can lead to considerable loss of assets. As software testing is a common practice for quality assurance, many Solidity projects have included built-in tests. It is unclear, however, what level of quality assurance these built-in tests can achieve. This paper presents Deviant, a mutation testing tool for Solidity smart contracts. It automatically generates mutants of a given Solidity project and runs all mutants against the given tests to evaluate their effectiveness. To simulate various faults in Solidity smart contracts, Deviant provides mutation operators for all the unique features of Solidity according to the Solidity fault taxonomy, in addition to the traditional programming constructs. We have used Deviant to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests for three Solidity projects. The results indicate that these tests have not yet achieved high mutation scores and that a test suite adequate for the statement and branch coverage criteria of Solidity smart contracts does not necessarily provide a high-level assurance of code quality. Such observations offer important guidelines for Solidity developers to implement more effective tests in order to deliver trustworthy code and reduce the risk of financial loss. © 2019 IEEE.},

The BC-IoT transaction model is capable of automatically collecting, uploading, and recording all relevant data in the enterprise transaction process under the premise of satisfying certain assumptions. This model does not require manual intervention at any point in the process; no data recorded on the distributed ledgers can be tampered with or revoked. The data collected using this model can be used as information on events, providing data support for the events approach to basic accounting theory. This practice responds to the important insight of sorter, who proposes the provision of accounting information in real time and on demand to substantially improve the usefulness of accounting information. This paper also identifies that BC technology can significantly improve the relevance, faithful representation, timeliness, comparability, and other aspects of accounting information quality. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {In Malaysia, a new regulation of traffic offences demerit points has been over a debate. Therefore, a blockchain model is formulated to solve this issue. It serves a purpose to be a Proof of Work (PoW) of a blockchain system. This model contains application layer and blockchain layer with smart contract inside. The smart contracts act as a conditional filter which follows the regulation rules. It contains three contracts starting from the declaration of each offence's demerit points and fines until the penalties when a certain amount of demerit points is collected, including revocation of driver license. The contracts will be automatically executed when such conditions are fulfilled. A transaction schema is also designed to match the schema of a traffic offence system. This model is deployed in online environment with two servers synced to each other to prove the decentralized characteristic of blockchain. It is developed using NodeJS while preserving JSON format for transaction between server and client. A user interface is also provided as a simulation media where a traffic officer can input offences and send it to blockchain server while public users or the driver itself can check the status of the driver license recorded on the blockchain. Government officer can monitor the records through a dashboard analytics provided which contains graphs and charts based on the records. This interface is used as media to do evaluation which produces satisfying results. The evaluation shows that the smart contracts are executed properly as compared to real regulations. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

	abstract = {The emerging Blockchain (BC) and Distributed Ledger technologies have come to impact a variety of domains, from capital market sectors to digital asset management in the Internet of Things (IoT). As a result, more and more BC-based decentralized applications for numerous cross-domain services have been developed. These applications implement specialized decentralized computer programs called Smart Contracts (SCs) which are deployed into BC frameworks. Although these SCs are open ato public, it is challenging to discover and utilize such SCs for a wide range of usages from both systems and end-users because such SCs are already compiled in form of byte-codes without any associated meta-data. This motivates us to propose a solution called Semantic SC (SSC) which integrates RESTful semantic web technologies in SCs, deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, for indexing, browsing and annotating such SCs. The solution also exposes the relevant distributed ledgers as Linked Data for enhancing the discovery capability. To achieve this goal, the OWL-S service ontology is extended by incorporating some domain specific terminologies, which are used in the development of the proposed SSCs. As a result, SSC can be utilized to enrich queries for a domain-specific terms across multiple distributed ledgers, which greatly increases the discovery capability of decentralized IoT applications and services. Contribution in standardization is also discussed. We believe that our research work takes the first steps towards connecting BC-based decentralized services with semantic web services in order to provide better IoT ecosystems. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, food safety issues have drawn growing concerns from society. In order to efficiently detect and prevent food safety problems and trace the accountability, building a reliable traceability system is indispensable. It is especially essential to accurately record, share, and trace the specific data within the whole food supply chain, including the process of production, processing, warehousing, transportation, and retail. The traditional traceability systems have issues, such as data invisibility, tampering, and sensitive information disclosure. The blockchain is a promising technology for the food safety traceability system because of the characteristics, such as the irreversible time vector, smart contract, and consensus algorithm. This paper proposes a food safety traceability system based on the blockchain and the EPC Information Services and develops a prototype system. The management architecture of on-chain off-chain data is proposed as well, through which the traceability system can alleviate the data explosion issue of the blockchain for the Internet of Things. Furthermore, the enterprise-level smart contract is designed to prevent data tampering and sensitive information disclosure during information interaction among participants. The prototype system was implemented based on the Ethereum. According to the test results, the average time of information query response is around 2 ms, while the amount of on-chain data and query counts are 1 GB and 1000 times/s, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.},

Due to the attendant growth in the importance of security, significant attention has been devoted to the challenge of designing and implementing a robust mobile payment scheme for securing online transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate a robust mobile payment scheme based on sturdy certificateless signatures with bilinear pairing. We elegantly refine the proposed mobile payment scheme to make it suitable for computation-constrained mobile devices. The practicability of the proposed mobile payment scheme is then certified via a rigorous security analysis and thorough performance evaluation using the Raspberry PI as the implementation platform for our proposed scheme.

The coalition is forming for solving complex tasks in industry applications that requires sequential united actions from the several robots. The main idea is that the process is split into two stages: scheduling and dynamic execution. On the scheduling stage, the coalition is defined based on the correlation of existing tasks and robot equipment, and the execution plan is formed and stored in smart contracts. The second stage is the plan execution. During this stage, smart contract controls how each robot solves its sub-task and whether it solves the sub-task due to the planned moment of time. In case of any deviation from the plan, smart contacts will provide a solution for returning to the plan or for changing the coalition composition with new robots and an execution plan.

It remains an elusive pursuit for many developing economies suffering from public infrastructural project failures. Although the causes of these failures are identifiable, they remain persistent. Government corruption has been identified as the primary cause of project failures amidst a host of other causal factors, spurred by the ambiguity in public service administration. These factors heighten capital expenditures and hence, the need for more transparent systems in public infrastructural project planning and -delivery. This research uses a case-study methodology to examine the importance of public involvement in addressing the causes of failures in public infrastructural project planning and -delivery. Using Nigeria as a case, the findings from conducted interviews and a document review support the proposition of a technologically collaborative approach in addressing the causes of public infrastructural project failures.

	abstract = {Fog computing systems are designed to provide localized computation, storage, and communication services in close proximity to the endpoint mobile and IoT devices. Fog service providers typically monetize their service usage via centralized payment mechanisms in unverifiable and non-transparent manner. Therefore, there exists a need for a trust-enabling payment mechanism whereby fog service providers should be incentivized or penalized based upon the continuous feedback from endpoint devices. We propose a decentralized reverse-bidding scheme developed using the key features of blockchain and smart contracts. We develop a solution that allows the users or devices to initiate the bidding process by making a request for services to be provided by nearby public fog nodes, and these fog nodes to make bid offers in return. The proposed scheme ensures that all fog nodes on the network can equally and fairly make offers to win the bid. The bidding process incorporates the automated payments at the end of the service. Our solution is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts. It also integrates a reputation system for fog nodes and imposes a penalty for misbehaving nodes. Our solution is fully decentralized and provides a high level of trust, transparency, and security. In the paper, we present the system architecture, implementation details, and show the correct functionality of the overall proposed solution. In addition, we provide performance, cost, and security analyses of the smart contract code to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness against major security concerns. The results show that the cost of running the smart contract remained less than three cents with the current Ethereum price (i.e., 183.22 USD/Eth). We have also made our smart contract code publicly available on Github.11https://github.com/MazenDB/ReverseAuction © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As smart contracts are growing in size and complexity, it becomes harder and harder to ensure their correctness and security. Due to the lack of isolation mechanisms a single mistake or vulnerability in the code can bring the whole system down, and due to this smart contract upgrades can be especially dangerous. Traditional ways to ensure the security of a smart contract, including DSLs, auditing and static analysis, are used before the code is deployed to the blockchain, and thus offer no protection after the deployment. After each upgrade the whole code need to be verified again, which is a difficult and time-consuming process that is prone to errors. To address these issues a security protocol and framework for smart contracts called Cap9 was developed. It provides developers the ability to perform upgrades in a secure and robust manner, and improves isolation and transparency through the use of a low level capability-based security model. We have used Isabelle/HOL to develop a formal specification of the Cap9 framework and prove its consistency. The paper presents a refinement-based approach that we used to create the specification, as well as discussion of some encountered difficulties during this process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to change the way the world works from home automation to smart cities, from improved healthcare to an efficient management system in supply chains to industry 4.0 revolution. IoT is increasingly becoming an essential part of the homes and industrial automation; nevertheless, there are still many challenges that need to fix. IoT solutions are costly and complicated, while issues regarding security and privacy must be addressed with a sustainable plan. Support the growing number of connected devices; the IoT is in dire need of a reboot. Blockchain technology might be the answer. Starting as a decentralized financial solution in the form of Bitcoin, Blockchain technology has expanded to diverse areas and Information Technology applications. Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts can address the outstanding security and privacy issues that impede further development of the IoT. Blockchain is a decentralized system with no central governance, facilitates interactions, promotes new and improved transaction models, and allows autonomous coordination of the devices using enhanced encryption techniques. The primary reason for this paper is to showcase the challenges and problems we are facing with the current internet of things solutions and analyze how the use of Blockchain and Smart Contracts can help achieve a new, more robust internet of things system. Finally, we examine some of the many projects using the Internet of Things together with Blockchain and Smart Contracts, to create new solutions that are only possible by integrating these technologies. © Science and Information Organization.},

	abstract = {At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs stored and executed on a blockchain. The Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, has been designed to use these programs offering secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine performs smart contracts runs, where the execution of each contract is limited to the amount of gas required to execute the operations described in the code. Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non-negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts. In order to show the generality of our method on other use cases, we also report its performance on video on demand recommendation. © 2018 IEEE.},

Nonetheless, the issue is that it can be difficult to determine which one to trust as a seller. Especially in the world of 5G, where a marketplace is a mandatory component where developers can upload and verify their developed Network Services (NSs) or chained Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Since those NSs are provisioned for a production environment, their consumers would need to trust the developer or the owner of that NS. To this end, in this paper we propose a smart distributed NFV Marketplace, in which we try to resolve security weaknesses related to the verification of the integrity of the developed VNFs and NSs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The evolution of Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) boosts the amount of IIoT data. Machine learning promotes the progress of data analytics services. In order to facilitate the flow and explore the economic value of IIoT data, it is crucial to consider data packet transactions (DPTs) and data analytics service transactions (DASTs) simultaneously. Centralized data trading platforms emerge to realize transactions of data commodities. However, centralized platforms lack trust and robustness. How to realize DPTs and DASTs in a decentralized way is a challenging issue. In this paper, a new transaction solution based on the smart contract-enabled blockchain technology is proposed, which consists of the DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract. The DPT smart contract is implemented to trade data packets. The DAST smart contract provides a competitive way to trade data analytics services. Both smart contracts are designed to enable entities in IIoT to execute DPTs and DASTs automatically and honestly. Moreover, the transaction disputes between different IIoT entities are solved by the big data center off-chain, and the treatment results will be recorded on the blockchain by the big data center. The DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract are implemented and tested on Remix integrated development environment to achieve DPTs and DASTs. The gas costs of smart contracts are estimated and the security of the proposed solution is analyzed. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed solution is secure and feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

To address these issues, a blockchain-based framework is developed to enable interoperability of information-systems involved in the procurement process, increase citizen participation in eliciting project requirements and to enable a more transparent project monitoring and auditing.

	abstract = {The adoption of decentralized cryptocurrency platforms is growing fast, thanks to the implementation of Blockchain technology and smart contracts. It encourages the novel frameworks in a wide range of applications including finance and payment methods such as cash on delivery. However, a large number of smart contracts developed for cash on delivery suffer from fraudulent transactions which enable malicious participants to break the signed contracts without sufficient penalties. A shipper will involve in the system and place a mortgage to ensure reliability. A buyer also pledges an amount of money when making the order. Our process not only ensures the interests of a seller but also prevents a fraud shipper. The penalties will be made in two scenarios: (i) the buyer refuses to receive the commodities without any reliable reasons; and (ii) the shipper attempts to make any modification on the delivered goods during transportation. To help developers create more secure and reliable cash on delivery system, we introduce double smart contracts, a framework rooted in Blockchain technology and Ethereum, to tackle those mentioned problems. We also contribute our solution as an open source software that developers can easily add to their implementation to enhance functionality. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model. © 2018 by the authors.},

Apart from the tamper-proof exchange of transactions, distributed ledgers can provide a software environment for the trusted execution of smart contracts. In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied. Finally, we propose an architecture for the integration of the secure multi-contract platform into a 5G architecture. The integration proposal utilizes hybrid private-public blockchain networks for possible security, scalability, performance, and transaction cost optimization.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of Internet of things, all kinds of smart systems are quickly evolving to make our day-to-day life smoother and safer. Like many other sectors, transportation has entered a period of rapid change. Intelligent Traffic System is one of the fastest-growing fields within the smart systems, which is expected to increase road safety, mitigate traffic congestion, and enable fuel efficiency. The main functionalities of Intelligent Traffic System are as follows: (1) monitoring real-time traffic conditions in specific areas, (2) locating traffic emergencies (i.e. traffic accidents) in specific areas, and (3) dynamic monitoring and managing the continuous use in public transit services (i.e. change in car lanes) that may lead to changes in macro traffic conditions. This article will use the above-mentioned functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic System as underlying simulative scenarios, to design and to implement a smart transportation system based on Internet of things and blockchain—both share inherent distributed technology characteristics—combining both Internet of things sensor nodes and distributed ledger technology, to (1) record the changes in intelligent transportation systems and (2) set up a credit-token mechanism for paying the use and misuses in public transit services accordingly. The Intelligent Traffic System described in this article is intended to be used as experimental project only, given the terms and conditions as depicted in the simulated scenario. In real-life traffic scenarios, it may generate more complex system and data security issues, which will be elaborated and analyzed at the end of this article. Intelligent Traffic System is a comprehensive smart system; it can significantly change and reinvent the wheel for traffic conditions. Based on the system development as discussed in this article, there are still a lot of demands and challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Such topic scope will be explored in depth in our subsequent research. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Smart contract platforms, the most notable of which is probably Ethereum, facilitate the development of important and diverse distributed applications (e.g., naming services and fungible tokens) in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the inherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and verify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an underpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no incentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is faced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically increasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and directly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce an alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is of constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are stored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage network. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as any key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely deployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show that Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it minimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's future. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold manner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state of smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network. Second, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations reflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show that under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed by smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction fees by up to an order of magnitude. © 2019 IEEE.},

In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based distributed computing platforms enable the trusted execution of computation—defined in the form of smart contracts—without trusted agents. Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design non-fixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Multiple-operators (multi-OPs) spectrum sharing mechanism can effectively improve the spectrum utilization in fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks. The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a permissioned blockchain trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless communication networks in this paper. The Multi-OPs Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart contract is designed on the constructed permissioned blockchain to implement the spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs. The MOSS smart contract is tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE) and the gas costs of MOSS smart contract is estimated. The performance analysis of the proposed permissioned blockchain trust framework demonstrates that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better than traditional spectrum allocation solutions. © 2013 IEEE.},

Blockchain technology also supports incentive mechanisms for users taking part in the service through the generation of utility tokens to recognize the user's contribution. This paper presents the experimental test of a novel methodology for Demand Response programs implementation by using the Blockchain technology. The latter is employed for defining a distributed Demand Response service and a new system for its tracing and certification. For this work, a Smart Contract has been conceived and written to execute Demand Response events, calculate users' baseline, compute the support provided by each user towards the fulfilment of the requested load curve modification and remunerate each user with utility tokens proportionally to their contribution. To test the methodology, a Hyperledger Fabric network and a Smart Contract were deployed on four nodes of the Microgrid Laboratory of the Department of Energy Technology at Aalborg University (DK). Subsequently, a realistic scenario comprising two consumer nodes was developed using power electronic converters for generating the household profiles and Smart Meters for the measurement of the consumption profiles. Theoretical and experimental results show the feasibility of Distributed Ledger Technologies in smart grids management with a minimum investment in new hardware while enabling the active participation of customers in Demand Response more transparently and fairly.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While Ethereum smart contracts enabled a wide range of blockchain applications, they are extremely vulnerable to different forms of security attacks. Due to the fact that transactions to smart contracts commonly involve cryptocurrency transfer, any successful attacks can lead to money loss or even financial disorder. In this paper, we focus on the overflow attacks in Ethereum, mainly because they widely rooted in many smart contracts and comparatively easy to exploit. We have developed EASYFLOW, an overflow detector at Ethereum Virtual Machine level. The key insight behind EASYFLOW is a taint analysis based tracking technique to analyze the propagation of involved taints. Specifically, EASYFLOW can not only divide smart contracts into safe contracts, manifested overflows, well-protected overflows and potential overflows, but also automatically generate transactions to trigger potential overflows. In our preliminary evaluation, EASYFLOW managed to find potentially vulnerable Ethereum contracts with little runtime overhead.

	abstract = {Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market, one would like to predict whether it will be a success. In general this is not possible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximize the chance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is therefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We have investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether successful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart contracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as Etherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we present a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart contracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed contracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts. Next, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an anonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A significant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract itself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention that is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute. Finally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations for developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel of experts. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the major problems of e-commerce globally is the selling and buying of goods among the parties over the Internet in which the traders may not trust their partners. Cash on delivery allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their home or a location they choose. This is sometimes called a payment system because customers receive goods before making a payment. This paper investigates a critical verification process issue in the cash on delivery system. In particular, we propose a multi shippers mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and trustworthy verification across participants in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism is given to not only ensure the benefits of the seller but also prevent shipper's fraudulent. The solution leverages the consistency and robustness of decentralized markets where trust is flexible and effectively controlled. To demonstrate the application and implementation of the proposed framework, we conduct several case studies on real-world transaction datasets from a local computer retailer. We also provide our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. Our conclusion is that the continued integration of multi-shipper mechanism and blockchain technology in the decentralized markets will cause significant transformations across several disciplines. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is highly secure in design and can hand huge data efficiently. A smart contract, based on a blockchain, can automate the entire process and make the contract self-executing in nature. Since the first introduction of these technologies in the 1990s, they have been at the center interest for academia and industry. Numerous researchers and practitioners have investigated the principles and usage of blockchain and smart contracts. However, little is coincidental regarding estimating the consumer's additional willingness to pay (WTP) and analyzing the relationship with socio-economic characteristics of the consumer for blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector. This study conducted the survey on 1000 heads of the household or homemakers who represent population well in South Korea and estimated additional WTP using one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation (OOHB DC CV) method. About 65% of sample respondents answered they are willing to pay some additional premium for blockchain and smart contracts. The mean WTP has the value of KRW 28,425.43 (USD 25.38) and the median WTP is KRW 16,111.71 (USD 14.39). Those with high incomes, high education and more insurance contracts are more likely to pay extra for insurance policies using blockchain and smart contracts. Considering the total number of households in South Korea, the aggregated additional WTP is about 8 percent of the net income of the insurance industry in fiscal year of 2017. Consequently, strategic development of insurance products using block chains and smart contracts targeting educated consumers with high-income will increase the number of policyholders, which can in turn increase premium revenues. © 2018 by the author.},

These include the disbursement of scholarships to financially help the students belonging to low-income families. Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students (CSS) is one such scheme that financially helps meritorious students in pursuing graduation and post-graduation. This scheme was introduced in 2008. Scholarships from CSS have been helping students to fund their educational expenses. But there have been some difficulties faced by the students in availing this scholarship. These include lack of traceability of application form, loss of application form in transit through Indian Postal Service, lack of transparency between students and their respective Education Boards, and lack of bank account verification. In this paper, we propose a Smart Contract for CSS Scheme that overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks. It has four entities: Students, Education Boards, Colleges, and Banks. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract proposed in this paper, has been developed to provide a user-friendly environment to a student and maintain a transparent and constant connection between students and their respective Education Boards. Many applications have been developed on the Blockchain platform but to the best of our knowledge, there does not exists any government scholarship scheme on the Blockchain platform in India. © 2020 The Authors.

Gas, paid in Ethers (i.e., the cryptocurrency in Ethereum), is required for the costs to upload and run smart contracts on Ethereum. As cost-inefficiently designed smart contracts result in unnecessary costs, it is vital to eliminate any gas-wasteful code fragments to optimize the deployment costs. In this study, we define five gas-wasteful patterns: ‘Over-public variables’, ‘Redundant initial values’, ‘Loose packing’, ‘Non-base unit types’, and ‘Non-constant variables’, based on the state variables in Solidity, the most commonly used implementation language for smart contracts in Ethereum. We also propose improvement methods related to these patterns and a solution to identify and eliminate the patterns. Furthermore, we analyze 143 real-world contracts deployed on Ethereum and find that 56% of them include the above-mentioned patterns. We also upgrade 43 of the pattern-matched contracts and demonstrate that their deployment costs are decreased on an average by 13.47%, and the most-reduced rate is 64%. © 2017 SERSC Australia.},

While much research has addressed the formalisation of the semantics of EVM bytecode, relatively little attention has been devoted to that of Solidity. In this paper we propose a minimal calculus for Solidity contracts, which extends an imperative core with a single primitive to transfer currency and invoke contract procedures.

	abstract = {Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure, Blockchain-based financial and business transactions. However, a major concern in Ethereum is the security of its smart contracts. Many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts not only present challenges to the maintenance of blockchain, but also lead to serious financial loses. There is a significant need to better assist developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability. In this paper, we propose a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help Solidity developers to find repetitive contract code and clone-related bugs in smart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity checking techniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for existing solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able to efficiently identify code clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity code given by users, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers, SmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale. When applied to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, we found that the clone ratio of solidity code is close to 90%, much higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related bugs can be identified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a precision of 96%. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In traditional cloud storage systems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as an important technology for solving the problem of data privacy and fine-grained access control. However, in all ABE schemes, the private key generator has the ability to decrypt all data stored in the cloud server, which may bring serious problems such as key abuse and privacy data leakage. Meanwhile, the traditional cloud storage model runs in a centralized storage manner, so single point of failure may leads to the collapse of system. With the development of blockchain technology, decentralized storage mode has entered the public view. The decentralized storage approach can solve the problem of single point of failure in traditional cloud storage systems and enjoy a number of advantages over centralized storage, such as low price and high throughput. In this paper, we study the data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems and propose a framework that combines the decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, the Ethereum blockchain, and ABE technology. In this framework, the data owner has the ability to distribute secret key for data users and encrypt shared data by specifying access policy, and the scheme achieves fine-grained access control over data. At the same time, based on smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the keyword search function on the cipher text of the decentralized storage systems is implemented, which solves the problem that the cloud server may not return all of the results searched or return wrong results in the traditional cloud storage systems. Finally, we simulated the scheme in the Linux system and the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show that our scheme is feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain, originated from Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention from the academic community because of its decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Validation of Bitcoin transactions rely upon the successful execution of scripts written in a simple and effective, non-Turing-complete by design language, simply called script. This makes the validation of closed scripts, i.e. those associated to actual transactions and bearing full information, straightforward. Here we address the problem of validating open scripts, i.e. we address the validation of redeeming scripts against the whole set of possible inputs, i.e. under which general conditions can Bitcoins be redeemed? Even if likely not one of the most complex languages and demanding verification problems, we advocate the merit of formal verification for the Bitcoin validation framework. We propose a symbolic verification theory for open script, a verifier toolkit, and illustrate examples of use on Bitcoin transactions. Contributions include (1) a formalisation of (a fragment of script) the language; (2) a novel symbolic approach to script verification, suitable, e.g. for the verification of newly defined and non-standard payment schemes; and (3) building blocks for a larger verification theory for the developing area of Bitcoin smart contracts. The verification of smart contracts, i.e. agreements built as transaction-based protocols, is currently a problem that is difficult to formalise and computationally demanding. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain. © 2013 IEEE.},

The performance of the system was measured in terms of cost of use through the concept of ‘gas usage’. It was determined that such costs are significantly less than that of Amazon and eBay for high volume users.

	abstract = {Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The global implementation architecture of the traditional stock market distributes responsibilities and data across different intermediaries, including financial and governmental organizations. Each organization manages its system and collaborates with the others to facilitate trading on the stock exchange platform, and typically buy-sell orders go through different parties before settlement. This design architecture that involves a complex chain of intermediaries has several limitations and shortcomings, such as a single point of failure, a longer time for financial settlements, and weak transparency. Blockchain technology consists of a network of computer nodes that securely share a common ledger without the need of having any kind of intermediaries. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based architecture for a fully decentralized stock market. Our architecture is based on a private Ethereum blockchain to create a consortium network leveraging organizations that are already involved in the traditional stock exchange to act as validating nodes. In our architecture, the stock exchange trading logic is completely implemented on a smart contract, while considering the existing governmental market regulations. Since the new platform does not introduce significant changes to the stock exchange trading logic and does not eliminate any of the traditional parties from the system, our proposal promotes efficient adoption and deployment of decentralized stock exchange platforms. In addition, we present a proof of concept implementation of the new architecture, including the smart contract for trade exchange, as well as a virtualization-based test network to assess the platform performance. The test network consists of virtual nodes that run the developed stock exchange smart contract where we measure the buy-sell orders throughput and latency under different network sizes and trading workload scenarios. The obtained results have shown that the proposed trading platform can reach a throughput of 311.8 tx/sec, which is equivalent to 89% of the optimal throughput when the sending rate is 350 tx/sec. This throughput is largely sufficient to meet the requirement of major stock exchanges, such as Singapore stock market.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is a tamper-proof distributed transaction registry; first popularized by Bitcoin [1], it has now been extended to support storage of arbitrary state and computations in-ledger. Ethereum [2] and its smart contract model have proven to be a very popular choice for this task, routinely managing assets valued in the billions. However, development of such contracts has been anything but easy. While formally specified, the Ethereum execution platform is based on a low-level machine, quite similar to assembly; semantics for contract operations such as call are quite complex, and the need for resource management creates unanticipated modes of failure. The dominant day-to-day programming platform for Ethereum is Solidity [3], an Object- Oriented language that identifies contracts with objects. While reasoning about Solidity programs is much easier than for their bytecode counterparts, it is not extent of challenges either, and moreover, Solidity lacks a source-level semantics, which forces developers to reason over output bytecode again. In this short paper we explore the main barriers to lift in order to achieve a principled compilation strategy for Solidity. We will review the standard concepts on verified and secure compilation, and frame them in the context of the Ethereum platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

The developed architecture facilitates use case scenarios of service and resource offers according to fixed and dynamic pricing schemes, fixed usage period, prepaid quota for flexible usage, division of income, consensual decisions among collaborative service providers, and constrained based usage of resources or services.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel blockchain-based energy trading architecture for electric vehicles (EVs) within smart cities. By allowing local renewable energy providers to supply public charging stations, EV drivers can gain access to affordable energy and optimally plan for their charging operations. For this purpose, we present a smart-contract based trading platform that runs on top of a private Ethereum network. Contrary to existing solutions, we rely on the legacy billing and metering of the existing utility company in order to avoid making major changes to the existing infrastructure. The trading logic, including the auction mechanism, used to exchange energy can be defined in a smart-contract and applied within the platform. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of some existing auction mechanisms and the underlying private Ethereum network in supporting the corresponding energy trading transaction load. We develop a virtualization-based simulator for Ethereum and measure both the transaction throughput and latency under different network and workload scenarios. The obtained results have shown that the current Ethereum implementation can support charging requests from EVs during peak hours in very crowded cities, such as Singapore. © 2020 IEEE.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of 'pre-verification' is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An online review system is an important part of almost every e-commerce platform, especially a tourism e-commerce. However, various problems exist in the current online review systems. The review content is stored in a centralized database of each individual platform. Each platform differs in review management methods. In some cases, the review score of the same product disagrees across different platforms. Moreover, a centralized system has low transparency because it is difficult to trace individual actions within the system. As a result, some users are skeptical of the reliability of online reviews in centralized systems. This work proposes a global travel review framework based-on the blockchain technology. The incorporation of blockchain helps improve an online review system. The best practices for online review management from popular platforms, and the guidelines from trusted sources are used to develop the new system. The use of blockchain improves an online review system through its unique features of high transparency, security, and reliability. Additionally, the proposed framework relies on a community-driven environment. The accessibility level of users is controlled by using the smart contract. There is no single authoritative owner of the system. All participants in the system can exert controls on the system equally. This work illustrates the details of a blockchain-based global travel review framework. The advantages and disadvantages of such a system are discussed. The proposed framework can be easily integrated with any existing platforms since it can be accessed publicly. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.},

	abstract = {The blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms are one of the hottest topics in tech at the moment. Though most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology. The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 80% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities. © 2018 ACM.},

	abstract = {Blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in blocks through user-defined scripts known as smart contracts. Normally, a block of the chain consists of multiple transactions of smart contracts which are added by a miner. To append a correct block into the blockchain, miners execute these transactions of smart contracts sequentially. Later the validators serially re-execute the smart contract transactions of the block. If the validators agree with the final state of the block as recorded by the miner, then the block is said to be validated. It is then added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol. In Ethereum and other blockchains that support cryptocurrencies, a miner gets an incentive every time such a valid block successfully added to the blockchain. In most of the current day blockchains the miners and validators execute the smart contract transactions serially. In the current era of multi-core processors, by employing the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators fail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By adding concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this paper, we develop an efficient framework to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). Miners execute smart contract transactions concurrently using multi-threading to generate the final state of blockchain. STM is used to take care of synchronization issues among the transactions and ensure atomicity. Now when the validators also execute the transactions (as a part of validation) concurrently using multi-threading, then the validators may get a different final state depending on the order of execution of conflicting transactions. To avoid this, the miners also generate a block graph of the transactions during the concurrent execution and store it in the block. This graph captures the conflict relations among the transactions and is generated concurrently as the transactions are executed by different threads. The miner proposes a block which consists of set of transactions, block graph, hash of the previous block, and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, the validators re-execute the same smart contract transactions concurrently and deterministically with the help of block graph given by the miner to verify the final state. If the validation is successful then proposed block appended into the blockchain and miner gets incentive otherwise discard the proposed block. We execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering (BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering (MVTO) protocols as optimistic STMs. BTO and MVTO miner achieves 3.6x and 3.7x average speedups over serial miner respectively. Along with, BTO and MVTO validator outperform average 40.8x and 47.1x than serial validator respectively. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchanges. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate new large-scale production blockchains. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Smart Contracts have gained tremendous popularity in the past few years, to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. However, since the release of the Frontier network of Ethereum in 2015, there have been many cases in which the execution of Smart Contracts managing Ether coins has led to problems or conflicts. Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software. In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains.We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps 'unsafe»' programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017). In this study we analyze the source code of Parity and the library, and discuss how recognised best practices could mitigate, if adopted and adapted, such detrimental software misbehavior. We also reflect on the specificity of Smart Contract software development, which makes some of the existing approaches insufficient, and call for the definition of a specific Blockchain Software Engineering. © 2018 IEEE.},
