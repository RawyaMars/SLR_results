	abstract = {The arising awareness of drug safety has brought tremendous demands on improving traceability and transparency in the supply chain. Conventionally, centralized/distributed database-based traceability platforms are adopted by many drug companies to control drug quality and improve transparency levels. However, it is still challenging to link drug stakeholders into an information-sharing chain due to the potential data manipulations and interest conflicts. In this context, this paper proposes a unified five-layer Blockchain and Internet of Things-based smart tracking and tracing (BIoT3, in short) platform to provide a decentralized traceability solution in the drug supply chain. Following the five-layer blockchain platform architecture, a practical roadmap is provided for the drug industry to achieve blockchain design, development, application, and evaluation. Moreover, three core enabling components are presented: IoT-based drug identity management, on-chain \& off-chain mechanism, smart contract-enabled drug services. According to the real data from collaborating companies, the feasibility and efficiency of the BIoT3 platform have been verified using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The case study demonstrates that it not only gains useful insights into transaction sizes configuration for optimal blockchain performance, but also provides a feasible blockchain-based solution for drug traceability and visibility.},

	abstract = {Unlike previous reviews, most of which focus on a field and use qualitative methods to analyze blockchain technology, herein main path analysis was used to determine the key route of citations and identify the developmental trajectories of blockchain technology and its major themes. A total of 3159 blockchain-related articles published through August 5, 2019, were gathered from the Web of Science. In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.},

The identification of mechanisms for reasoning about the common features of different languages gives rise to language-independent program verification techniques.

In addition, these techniques have only been demonstrated in verification tasks where the code of the target program is completely known. We present a language-independent verification technique that works with big-step operational semantics and a general-purpose logic.

	abstract = {Education plays a vital role in human life. To encourage higher education, the Indian government has taken many initiatives. These include the disbursement of scholarships to financially help the students belonging to low-income families. Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students (CSS) is one such scheme that financially helps meritorious students in pursuing graduation and post-graduation. This scheme was introduced in 2008. Scholarships from CSS have been helping students to fund their educational expenses. But there have been some difficulties faced by the students in availing this scholarship. These include lack of traceability of application form, loss of application form in transit through Indian Postal Service, lack of transparency between students and their respective Education Boards, and lack of bank account verification. In this paper, we propose a Smart Contract for CSS Scheme that overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks. It has four entities: Students, Education Boards, Colleges, and Banks. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract proposed in this paper, has been developed to provide a user-friendly environment to a student and maintain a transparent and constant connection between students and their respective Education Boards. Many applications have been developed on the Blockchain platform but to the best of our knowledge, there does not exists any government scholarship scheme on the Blockchain platform in India.},

In this paper, we analyze 96 articles (written from 2016 to 2020) presenting solutions to tackle software engineering-specific challenges related to the development, test, and security assessment of blockchain-oriented software. In particular, we review papers (that appeared in international journals and conferences) relating to six specific topics: smart contract testing, smart contract code analysis, smart contract metrics, smart contract security, Dapp performance, and blockchain applications. Beyond the systematic review of the techniques, tools, and approaches that have been proposed in the literature to address the issues posed by the development of blockchain-based software, for each of the six aforementioned topics, we identify open challenges that require further research.},

For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain.

Objective We aim at addressing the site availability issue on a hierarchical network by designing an immutable/transparent/source-verifiable quorum mechanism. Methods We developed an approach to combine a hierarchical learning algorithm, a novel Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) consensus protocol, and a design of blockchain smart contracts. We constructed QuorumChain as an example and evaluated the scenarios of site-unavailability during the initialization and/or iteration phases of the modeling process on three healthcare/genomic datasets. Results When one or more sites would become unavailable, HierarchicalChain could not function, whereas QuorumChain improved predictive correctness significantly (the full Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, or AUC, improved from 0.068 to 0.441, all with p-values {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion By constructing a quorum to continue the modeling process, QuorumChain possesses the capability to tackle the situation of sites being unavailable. It inherits the capability of learning on network-of-networks, improves learning continuity, and provides data/software immutability, transparency, and provenance, which can be important in expediting clinical research.},

Two auction price systems and several settlement mechanisms are formulated and compared to assess local trading profit and local market efficiency. We also implement a SC-based mechanism that embeds the auction results and rules to increase trust in the bidding and settlement processes. Our simulations use actual consumption and generation data from 11 houses with smart appliances and self-generation capabilities. We show that auctions, if used consistently, can help the development of a local trade by encouraging people to buy from their neighbors and invest in more generating facilities, knowing that there is a local market on which to rely. Compared to the hybrid - Pay-as-Bid (PaB) in the 1st round plus Uniform Price (UP) in the 2nd round - approach, the pure 2-round UP auction was shown to decrease trading with the retailer by 7.5\%. The market indicators are quite similar for the two pricing methods, whereas the proposed settlement mechanism reduces the buyers' payments by 7\% and increases sellers' encashments by around 8\%.},

	abstract = {With the maturity of the blockchain technology, more and more blockchain digital currencies including the Bitcoin, the Ethereum and the Ripple have been developed. Meanwhile, the security problem of the blockchain digital currency has become increasingly serious. It is necessary to build a provenance model for a large number of blockchain transaction, which can be used to find out which link has trouble and who is responsible once a problem occurs. However, the existing blockchain transaction data analysis methods have low traceback accuracy for data provenance. Therefore, a novel blockchain transaction provenance model with graph attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. The graph attention mechanism is used to identify the traders. Then, a triplet data structure is built to record provenance information and express the relationship between transaction amount and traders. Finally, the smart contract is used to implement the proposed provenance model. The provenance information can be searched through the interface provided by the smart contract when the traceback is required. In addition, the real large-scale Bitcoin transaction dataset Elliptic is used to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. The experiment show that the proposed method achieves state of the art results of the traceback accuracy.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted many industries, in particular the healthcare sector exposing systemic vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and supply chain management. A major challenge during the pandemic was related to the increased demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), resulting in critical shortages for healthcare and frontline workers. This is due to the lack of information visibility combined with the inability to precisely track product movement within the supply chain, requiring a robust traceability solution. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology to manage and track PPE products in the supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform PPE supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We present detailed cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution for PPE supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders.},

Hence, residents can use and store clean energy to reduce the amount of electricity they buy from the grid, thereby reducing energy consumption. However, the traditional centralised aggregator approach has many disadvantages, including malicious node attacks, difficult dispatching, high transmission consumption and high operation cost. The day-ahead smart contract has been innovatively designed in this paper to enable the collaborative decision of participants on the day-ahead dispatch plan and subsequently ensure the forecast monitoring during the next day. In addition, the intraday smart contract can autonomously realise multilateral transactions based on reputation value and billing autonomously.

To promote the coordinated development of EVs and photovoltaics (PV) under the background of open power selling, a PV–EV bidding model that considers carbon emissions based on the distributed storage and smart contract technology of a blockchain is proposed in this study. This model aims to provide economic benefits to market players, ensure the safety and environmental protection of power grid operations, and integrate the ladder-type carbon emission trading mechanism. Then, it divides the electricity market into the electricity sales layer, i.e., active distribution networks (ADNs) and PV systems, and the electricity purchase layer, i.e., EVs. Smart contracts are signed with the agent layer, i.e., charging stations. The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the price and power of PV systems and EVs in the optimal contract, and the revenue of PV systems and EVs can be increased by over 35\%. Moreover, the orderly charging and discharging of EVs is coordinated with the characteristics of the daily power generation and evening load peaks of PV systems. The proposed model can effectively provide an optimal scheduling scheme for peak load shifting and valley filling while reducing the carbon emissions of ADNs. It also promotes the local consumption of PV.},

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.},

The business logic of dApps is usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii) assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants. On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption perspective. An experiment involving 2186 smart contracts demonstrates that the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code segments that need optimizations.},

According to the recent version of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users have the right to fully control their personal data. Many web service providers also provide some options for users to control the data. However, it is still a challenge to investigate how they enforce these actions. There is a need to deploy additional measures to secure the data access. Focused on this challenge, in this work, we design a scheme that uses smart contract and blockchain to provide a secure data sharing and access environment. In our scheme, there are three major parties and each of them has its own key pair for encrypting and signing the data. We also develop four main smart contracts for different parties, and discuss what kinds of data should be immutable and placed on-chain. In the evaluation, we explore the performance of our scheme under different platforms such as Ethereum with EtHash, Ethereum with Clique, and Hyperledger. With the analysis of several potential attacks, our results indicate the viability and effectiveness of our scheme.},

	abstract = {Blockchains have been booming in recent years. As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give blockchains a user-defined logic. A smart contract is an executable program that can automatically carry out transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. However, some security issues in smart contracts are difficult to fix, and smart contracts also lack quality assessment standards. Therefore, this study proposes a Multiple-Objective Detection Neural Network (MODNN), a more scalable smart contract vulnerability detection tool. MODNN can validate 12 types of vulnerabilities, including 10 recognized threats, and identify more unknown types without the need for specialist or predefined knowledge through implicit features and Multi-Objective detection (MOD) algorithms. It supports the parallel detection of multiple vulnerabilities and has high scalability, eliminating the need to train separate models for each type of vulnerability and reducing significant time and labor costs. This paper also developed a data processing tool called Smart Contract-Crawler (SCC) to address the lack of smart contract vulnerability datasets. MODNN was evaluated using more than 18,000 smart contracts from Ethereum. Experiments showed that MODNN could achieve an average F1 Score of 94.8\%, the current highest compared to several standard machine learning (ML) classification models.},

The shared information is used both for monitoring the health status of the vehicle’s battery and for remuneration in Vehicle-to-Grid programs. A blockchain platform and a set of appropriate smart contracts have been developed for supporting the interactions among the different actors and for creating battery usage profiles. To protect sensitive data, we limit the visibility scope of such data only to subsets of actors using blockchain channels. This approach preserves the privacy of the car owner on one hand and guarantees the compliance to correct charging and discharging modes, on the other hand, by using dedicated smart contracts to manage data for each of the channels. The approach here described proposes and develops a blockchain-based ecosystem for efficiently managing electric vehicles especially when these are called to provide electrical grid services, such as it happens for Vehicle-to-Grid programs. In this case, it is indeed possible that the battery undergoes an accelerated aging and thus certified recording of charging data for legal liability is one of the issues here dealt with. When possible, data are collected from multiple sources (e.g. the charging station and the Electric Vehicle) and from different parties with conflicting interests for validating data and breaking data silos that are within the car, the charging stations and the Battery Management System.},

Blockchain can provide technical solutions for trust issues between manufacturing service providers and demanders, but less research has focused on the stable maintenance of a blockchained shared manufacturing network (BSMN). Industrial knowledge graph and cognitive intelligence play an important role in designing incentive mechanisms for BSMN. Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper designs various incentive models and develops the corresponding smart contracts to encourage different enterprises to participate in the “accounting” operations, to enhance the trust and maintain the operational stability of BSMN. Firstly, the evolution mechanism of BSMN was analyzed. Then, an evolutionary game model between shared manufacturing enterprise nodes was established to deduce the stable state of BSMN. Based on the analysis of the evolutionarily stable state, an incentive model with three strategies to encourage different enterprise nodes to participate in “accounting” operations was determined, and smart contracts of the incentive models were developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive models was verified by simulation experiments.},

This study introduces a novel information exchange and management system for construction firms based on blockchain technology and chatbots. The system leverages the characteristics of blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer operation mode, data integrity, structuring, and privacy, and the chatbots' merits regarding ease of use and degree of automation. The system is developed for tracking work progress in construction projects as a generic use-case using a four-step approach. First, a private blockchain network is configured for data distribution and storage. Second, a smart contract is coded for regulating data writing/reading operations. Third, a chatbot is developed for data collection and retrieval through textual conversations. Fourth, serverless cloud function and cloudant database are configured to allow the linkage between the blockchain network and the chatbot. A prototype of the system is built and applied to a case study of non-residential construction project to test and verify its capabilities. Further, the system's performance is assessed in terms of the writing and reading latencies and the storage size. The system features can be extended by embedding mathematical algorithms to simultaneously analyze data and employing Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to maintain visuals and large-size data.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.},

One of the main open problems in the analysis of Ethereum smart contracts is the inference of sound bounds on their gas consumption. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first static analysis that is able to infer sound parametric (i.e., non-constant) gas bounds for smart contracts. The inferred bounds can be parametric on the sizes of the input parameters for the functions, but also they can be parametric on the contract state, or blockchain data. Our gas analysis is developed at EVM bytecode level, in which Ethereum gas model is defined. Our analysis is implemented in a tool named Gastap, Gas-Aware Smart contracT Analysis Platform, which takes as input a smart contract and automatically infers sound gas upper-bounds for its public functions. Gastap has been applied over 318,093 functions fetched from the Ethereum blockchain, and succeeded to obtain gas bounds for 90.24\% of them.},

This study presents an innovative solution that exploits smart construction objects (SCOs). It develops a SCOs-enabled blockchain oracles (SCOs-BOs) framework. To instantiate this framework, the system architecture of a blockchain-enabled construction supply chain management (BCSCM) system is developed and validated using a case study, whereby four primary smart contracts are examined in the context of off-site logistics and on-site assembly services. The validation results show that accurate data is retrieved against malicious data in each request, and the corresponding reputation scores are successfully recorded. The innovativeness of the research lies in two aspects. In addition to mobilizing SCOs as blockchain oracles to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds, it develops a decentralized SCO network to avoid the single point of failure (SPoF) problem widely existing in blockchain systems.

We studied Solidity smart contracts running on the Ethereum platform and identified that they had been exploited because of several programming issues, especially using low-level external calls to malicious sources. Since smart contracts are immutable after their deployment to autonomous multi-robot systems, they should be tested to fix possible development phase issues. We implemented a prototype plugin called SolGuard by extending the solhint linter to prevent three critical issues related to Solidity smart contract programs’ usage of external calls. The SolGuard plugin checks state variable order in the smart contracts, participation of delegatecall invocations, address type parameters in the smart contract’s constructor, and denial of service patterns. We empirically evaluate the SolGuard plugin with existing popular static analysis tools. Our results indicate that SolGuard outperformed the baseline tools in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

Smart contracts can simplify and accelerate the development of various applications, but they also bring some problems. For example, smart contracts are used to commit fraud, vulnerability contracts are deliberately developed to undermine fairness, and there are numerous duplicative contracts that waste performance with no actual purpose. In this paper, we propose a transaction-based classification and detection approach for Ethereum smart contract to address these issues. We collected over 10,000 smart contracts from Ethereum and focused on the data behavior generated by smart contracts and users. We identified four behavior patterns from the transactions by manual analysis, which can be used to distinguish the difference between different types of contracts. Then 14 basic features of a smart contract are constructed from these. To construct the experimental dataset, we propose a data slicing algorithm for slicing the collected smart contracts. After that, we use an LSTM network to train and test our datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our approach can distinguish different types of contracts and can be applied to anomaly detection and malicious contract identification with satisfactory precision, recall, and f1-score.},

	abstract = {An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.},

	abstract = {Recently, the revolution of 5G networks has promoted a wide application of wireless technology, and then followed with the prosperity of Location-Based Service (LBS). However, an intricate problem called privacy violation still restricts the development of this type of service. To preserve users’ privacy, some privacy preservation strategies had been proposed. As an efficient framework used for protecting personal privacy, users’ collaboration is mainly proposed for dealing with the issue of service bottleneck and the issue of attack focus. However, there are still several challenges far from being perfectly solved, such as the collusion attacks as well as the willingness of collaborative users. Therefore, to address these challenges, in this paper, based on the conception of information division and user’s incentive, a (t,n) smart contract privacy preservation scheme short for (t,n) SCPPS is proposed. In this scheme, the query information is encrypted and split by (t, n) threshold scheme, so the collaborative users will be difficult to learn anything about the initiator, and the collusion will be difficult to constitute the integral query without t users colluding with each other. On the other hand, the combination of (t, n) threshold scheme and smart contract further provide incentive competition, as just the earliest collaborative users that submit the partition information and get the corresponding feedback will obtain the incentive. At last, the security analyses were given, and then tests of users’ granularity and locations difference in the continuous query in the real environment. Furthermore, simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and the experimental verification is executed using two different types of datasets. Thus, compared with other similar schemes, the results with brief explanations about reasons can further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.},

An efficient digital network architecture is imperative to achieve secure and reliable interactions among the involved parties. From the service provider’s perspective, Bby defining the mobility ownership for customers, MaaScan bring a personalized transport system to complement or even fully replace the concept of private vehicle ownership. This paper paves the initial steps to develop a distributed architecture to realize a MaaS digital network using blockchain technology. Therefore, a comprehensive blockchain-enabled MaaS platform with related industries is illustrated in this paper. To do so, first, we define crypto-tickets as means of ownership of the service and devise a straightforward smart contract to be executed in the blockchain network, which allows the customers to exchange the service ownership in a privacy-preserved manner. Then, we evaluate our blockchain-based ownership scheme’s efficacy against the traditional membership plans using a simplified simulation instance in MATLAB. Finally, we discuss the blockchain potentials in personalizing the ownership of the service, congestion management, and data trading between various stakeholder of a comprehensive MaaS platform.},

With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts.

Nevertheless, the detection approaches still fall short in dealing with the big data-space Ponzi scheme smart contract detection application based on the class-imbalanced training data.

However, the following two issues should be tackled to secure its effectiveness: (1) how to guarantee the execution of safety inspections, especially under a tight construction schedule? and (2) how to ensure the inspection information is immutable, transparent, and traceable? This research, guided by the design science approach, aimed to develop a blockchain-enabled framework for assuring the effectiveness of on-site safety inspection of tower cranes (OSITC). First, a literature review was conducted to identify OSITC challenges and blockchain potential. Then, a blockchain-based conceptual framework was provided, with two major components: smart contracts and the consensus process, being discussed. Finally, using the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, a prototype system was developed to instantiate and test the proposed framework. The findings suggest that the blockchain can protect the OSITC’s effectiveness by allowing safety inspections to be automatically executed via smart contracts and providing relevant stakeholders with trustworthy inspection records via consensus algorithms. This study provides a novel solution for tower crane safety management to construction researchers and practitioners, inspiring more discussions about blockchain technology.},

Cloud storage audit schemes can help data owner (DO) to confirm the integrity of their data, but the existing schemes still have some limitations. On one hand, the existing schemes assume that DO's terminal devices are computationally powerful enough to handle various operations in a timely manner. While in practice, the terminal devices probably are mobile phones, tablets and other devices with low computing power. On the other hand, the existing schemes rely on a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA), but it is not in line with real application scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit (BBPO-PA) scheme for low performance terminal devices. Firstly, we introduced a trusted proxy authorized by DO, which can process and upload DO's encrypted files. Secondly, we applied blockchain in our scheme and utilized smart contracts instead of untrusted TPA to improve the reliability and stability of audit results. Thirdly, we took advantage of an index table to ensure that our scheme can support dynamic data operation. Finally, security analysis revealed that our scheme is provably secure in random oracle model. Meanwhile, performance analysis demonstrated that our scheme is efficient and especially suitable for low performance terminal devices.},

A decentralised, automated and secured financial platform is needed to enable all parties to control and track financial transactions, with no unauthorised changes allowed. The new technology, blockchain, enables data to be recorded, has no network participant with dominant power and manages data using specific functions, in line with smart contracts. The present study is the first to develop a framework proposing blockchain technology utilisation in IPD projects. The framework would enable core project team members to automatically execute all financial transactions, through coding the three main transactions of IPD projects: reimbursed costs, profit and cost saving, as functions of the IPD smart contract. To demonstrate the proposed framework's applicability, a “proof of concept” is developed and validated through an IPD case project. The practicality of the built-up hyperledger network (IBM® Blockchain Cloud Beta 2) and the advantages of the proposed smart contract functions are examined. The user-friendliness of the proposed financial system and its efficiency in automating all transactions are demonstrated. No deficiency is found in the blockchain network components. The study's findings, applied in a favourable external context, would facilitate IPD adoption and use across the AEC industry by providing a workable solution to existing financial barriers. The findings extend the horizon for further research on exploring blockchain's capabilities to solve comparable deficiencies to those affecting the AEC industry.},

The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can provide intelligent and effective solutions to various applications with higher accuracy that requires less or no human intervention. Smart Cities are one of the significant applications of the IoT comprising a collection of various services such as intelligent transportation, waste management, smart homes, etc. These heterogeneous services offer a wide range of collaborative applications in smart cities. A smart municipality in a smart city is a concept in which a digital municipal corporation is developed to provide comprehensive local government collaboration services based on digitization and automation aiming towards raising the living standards of citizens. Interoperability between heterogeneous services for collaborative tasks creates challenges for data security and privacy. Ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information is critical, and reliable data is essential to both the government and its citizens. In this paper, we proposed a service security architecture based on authentication and authorization for constrained environments during collaborative tasks for Software Defined Networking (SDN) and smart contract-enabled municipal smart cities. The proposed collaborative service security framework is being tested on the Multichain Blockchain networks. We present a novel method for using smart contracts in multichain blockchains for data security during collaborative tasks in smart city municipal architecture. The proposed security solution is based on the dynamism of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions securely between different heterogeneous IoT networks. We implemented a supportive use case for collaborative services in an SDN-enabled IoT architecture to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed service security architecture.},

	abstract = {Secure communication is one of the main challenges that are slowing down the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are more sensitive from a security perspective than other software due to several reasons. First, smart contracts are immutable thus cannot be easily patched once deployed. Second, smart contracts are directly tied to payments and can hold millions of dollars’ worth of digital currencies. Third, smart contracts are still a new practice thus do not have best coding practices and development lifecycles tailored for decentralized apps yet. Even though several testing and verification tools have been developed, smart contract vulnerabilities remain a clear and present danger. In this paper, we present an approach that is different from existing ones that attempt to eliminate vulnerabilities from smart contracts. Instead, we fortify Ethereum virtual machines (EVM) to stop dangerous transactions once vulnerabilities are detected in real-time. Since proving programs written in Turing-complete languages is undecidable, our approach complements current approaches by catching vulnerabilities and interrupts their executions during runtime. We have implemented our reinforcement on two widely used EVMs (js-evm and FISCO-BCOS-evm). The reinforced EVMs detects and interrupts all the vulnerabilities, 20\% of them missed by testing tools, in 100 real smart contracts. Our approach is practical with less than 34\% overhead. In fact, the reinforced FISCO-BCOS-evm has been integrated into the official release of FISCO-BCOS adopted by a large Chinese bank — WeBank.},

	abstract = {Every organization relies on a designed contract to manage the rules that guide and coordinate the activities within each organization. However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain’s features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable. We enhance this with a unique contract consolidation scheme to avoid redundancy. We utilize our proposed scheme to develop a uniquely transparent and fair workflow within organizations such as recruitment and employment leveraging blockchain-based oracle nodes. We extend this work to outsourced and sub-outsourced projects on the blockchain where an arbitration scheme is developed in multi-arbitration and multi-contracting scenarios. We also consider in our case in ex-facto situations. We tested our proposed blockchain-based idea over existing blockchain networks. Our results prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed idea.},

	abstract = {With the development of 5G(5th generation mobile networks) technology, smart cities are an inevitable trend in modern city development. Among them, smart city services are the foundation of 5G-enabled smart cities. As an emerging and informational city service model, crowdsourcing has been widely used in our daily life. However, in the existing crowdsourcing systems, the requesters and the workers are usually required to use the crowdsourcing platform as the trust center, and the payment depends on the third-party central payment institutions, which have a massive security risk. Once these centers are attacked or do evil, it will bring higher losses to the crowdsourcing parties. These problems will negatively affect the further development of 5G-enabled smart cities. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-empowered and decentralized trusted service mechanism for the crowdsourcing system in 5G-enabled smart cities. In the proposed mechanism, the crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages: initialization, task submission, task publication, task reception, scheme submission, scheme arbitration, payment, task rollback, and service compensation. The smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage, and the payment is completed by blockchain without the involvement of third-party central institutions. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum and compare it with the existing crowdsourcing system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and applicability of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.},

	abstract = {Construction supply chains (CSC) are characterized by their converging structure and the hierarchical payment system which is inherently related. Due to the pursuit of diverging goals and mutual interdependencies, risks and trust problems between stakeholders occur. Contracts are used to govern these complex collaborations. To track compliance to contract terms, various activities are executed by involved stakeholders. These activities do not add any value to an end-product, cause intransparency, are costly and cause conflicts. Therefore, a combination of asset tracking and blockchain technology is investigated in this paper to address these problems. A plug-and-play framework of interacting applications and a workflow to operate them are proposed. Proof of this concept is provided by developing prototypical applications and by testing them in various practice-based scenarios. Simplified asset tracking throughout supply chains was realized and linked to smart contracts. This resulted in semi-automated compliance tracking and an immutable record of transactions. Therefore, this work provides more insight into combining asset tracking and blockchain for compliance checking in the construction industry. By doing so, further automation of construction processes, increased transparency between stakeholders and a reduction of conflicts can be enabled. However, it remains clear that many other variables impact on transparency and trust; and while technology can make improvements, considerable procedural security and control measures are needed in addition. Therefore, we focus on semi-automation of workflows using distributed ledger technology.},

Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.},

This article will discuss primarily smart contracts on the blockchain the conclusion and execution of which does not interact with the physical world, as well as briefly touch upon smart contracts on the blockchain which do interact with the physical world. For these smart contracts, it will be determined to what extent existing EU internet laws can help support their development and if not, what is needed to support this. In order to answer this question, the following will be discussed: the rise of e-commerce and in particular the EU internet laws supporting and regulating e-commerce, how smart contracts work and how smart contracts compare with existing technological developments and comparable legal constructs (internet, bank accounts and bank guarantees). Subsequently, it will be explained how the use of smart contracts leads to a shift of confidence, from trust in people to trust in code. On the basis of The DAO hack and the problems that arose, it will be illustrated that this shift to trust in code is not as absolute as is often thought. The article concludes that applying specific EU laws on supporting and regulating e-commerce to smart contracts is difficult for two reasons. First of all, the starting points differ: trust in people versus trust in code. Secondly, technical and practical obstacles often inhibit applying internet laws in a meaningful manner. When using smart contracts, it makes more sense to prevent problems from arising than to correct them afterwards. For this reason, it is advocated that programmers work together with lawyers to create better smart contracts and that the legislator focuses on laws dealing with auditing smart contracts code by trusted third parties and automatically equating smart contracts with written contracts with wet ink signatures. This will hopefully facilitate the rise of smart contracts on the blockchain.},

All the entities engaged in the blockchain-based supply chain network handle the transaction between parties. All transactions are recorded to maintain high transparency and traceability across the supply chain ecosystem. In the event of abuse detection, a group signature mechanism is used. Three metrics, transaction efficiency, system risk reduction, and trust between participants, are considered for testing the system’s overall performance. After implementing the framework, the transaction efficiency is measured in terms of gas cost, average execution time, throughput and latency. These parameters show the satisfactory system performance.},

However, after data outsourcing, data owners no longer have physical possession of the data and face the risk of not being able to efficiently access the data. To solve the above issues, DStore employs smart contracts to audit the integrity of the outsourced data and develop a multikeyword retrieval module to support efficient access by data owners. In DStore, smart contracts can efficiently audit outsourced data without additional communication overhead for data owners; smart contracts and lessors do not compromise the privacy of data owners.

	abstract = {There are cases of corruption and fraud within the Philippine government that have gone under the radar, often due to a lack of transparency and verifiability. The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.},

The investment industry (including banks and brokers) can greatly benefit from the utilization of digital trading applications and corresponding tools, such as smart contracts. The goal of this research paper is to examine the possibility that brokers’ existing mobile apps outperform banks without mobile apps in the Russian financial sector. The efficiency of brokers is compared to banks in Russia. The results of these institutions’ activities are related to the number of profitable banks, which declines as a sign of high efficiency. The paper uses methods of t-test, linear and polynomial regression analysis between assets (dependent variable) and the profit to assets (independent variable) in Russia. The article finds the different directions of the utilization of the discussed technology, and they all share the consequential growth after the technology’s introduction. The paper also discusses the various areas of digital trading apps implementation and the future contributions for the Russian banking system and economy.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing reliance on loot boxes by the video game industry has attracted scrutiny from consumer groups and regulators. For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.},

	abstract = {A smart contract is a computer program, which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract. About 10\% of the security vulnerabilities in smart contracts are caused by misuse of codes without comments. Therefore, there is a need to design effective automatic code comment generation methods for smart contracts. In this study, we propose an information retrieval-based code comment generation method CCGIR for smart contracts. Since code clones are common in smart contract development, CCGIR finds the most similar code in the code repository and reuses its comment through an information retrieval approach from three aspects: semantic similarity, lexical similarity, and syntactic similarity of smart contract codes. We select a corpus, which contains 57,676 unique pairs of {\textless}method, comment{\textgreater} from 40,932 real-world smart contracts, as our experimental subject. Then we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that CCGIR can outperform nine state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three performance measures. Moreover, we perform a human study to further verify that CCGIR can generate higher quality comments. Finally, we find CCGIR can achieve promising performance on the other two code comment generation tasks (i.e., code comment generation for Java and code comment generation for Python). Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed method, we recommend researchers can use our proposed method as the baseline when evaluating their proposed novel code comment generation methods.},

In traditional mechanisms, there always exists a tradeoff between correctness of medical data and patient privacy. Here we are going to introduce the concept of blockchain and smart contract to build up an electronic medical record sharing mechanism: medical blockchain. Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control. Furthermore, the proposed medical blockchain can resist the potential Internet attack simulated by the formal verification. Thus, no leakage of patient identity occurs, and the tradeoff could be eliminated effectively without the modification of current hospital devices according to the simulation results.},

Therefore, according to the I4.0 manufacturing requirements of node scalability, trusted delivery and standard information modeling in the turnkey process, the paper proposes a reference information architecture of blockchain-driven turnkey project to establish a turnkey service system with AAS as the delivery core: (1) Take RAMI4.0 and I4.0 component as the engineering construction framework and supporting technology, by analyzing the bottleneck of blockchain in solving the I4.0 workshop, integrating the open blockchain architecture interoperability characteristics of BC-Based smart contract and Tangle-Based extensible IIoT-node, and establish complete solution to turnkey project information architecture under the I4.0 workshop; (2) Combined with the current turnkey project, this paper proposes and studies the AAS modeling method supporting blockchain verification and the delivery constraint mechanism based on smart contract, and designs the blockchain-based architecture, operation and implementation process with AAS as the delivery core; (3) Through the development and integration of key technologies, an experimental development and operation case of the turnkey project of the I4.0 workshop customized production line is given, which provides theoretical and technical references for more SMEs to quickly integrate into the turnkey project system.},

This is further compounded by the need for the industry to answer new challenges to meet the requirement of the International Maritime Organization 2020. The aim of this work is to illustrate how blockchain technology may be adopted for aiding in bunker dispute resolution. To demonstrate how blockchain may aid in disputes within the bunker industry, this paper first examines the existing bunker supply process, which involves the formation of contracts under English law, the Bunker Delivery Notes, the different types of disputes that may arise during a bunker transaction and the methods of dispute resolution utilised by the industry. Furthermore, the current literature in relation to blockchain technology and blockchain smart contracts is examined. Finally, interviews and surveys within the industry have been conducted to identify the benefits, and challenges, in adopting blockchain technology. The research found that blockchains may benefit the bunker supply chain resolving the effective resolution of bunker quality disputes. Furthermore, blockchains may also serve as a verification tool for electronic bunker delivery notes, which may aid quality and quantity bunker disputes as well as compliance with the new International Maritime Organisation 2020 requirements. As a result, despite the research having shown blockchain to be situationally dependent and having an element of legal uncertainty, blockchain does offer a solution to aid in bunker disputes and for improving the trust and credibility within the bunker industry.},

Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.},

We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract = {Context: Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, we present our second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7\% lucid and 72.2\% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3\% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping. Conclusion: iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.},

Here, we used a public-permission less Ethereum platform to execute the smart contracts in the Blockchain to process the customer orders and to identify the right enterprise. Later, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimal resource sharing and scheduling in a considered sustainable DMS. The objectives of the proposed model consist of simultaneously improvement of the performance measures such as makespan, machine utilization, energy consumption, and reliability. To solve this MILP model, a new Multi-objective-based Hybridized Moth Flame Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HMFEO) is developed and then the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The results obtained from implementing the model using experimental data along with different cases show the efficiency and the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. Moreover, several performance indicators like hyper volume are increased by nearly 15–20 \% that shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm with the NSGA-III.},

Thus, an effective method to prevent data leakage is needed. Traditional access control schemes include role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and capability-based access control (CapBAC) are all using a central or a third trusted party to manage user information, which is prone to single failure. In order to solve the problems, in this paper, a fine-grained access control scheme based on blockchain technology named SFAC is proposed. In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely studied and applied in various fields. It has the advantages of decentralization, imitation tampering, and traceability, and is a distributed public ledger. Therefore, combined with blockchain, SFAC can not only solve the problem of centralization, but also allow users to request resources in batches, and uses token mechanism to facilitate users’ requests. After the user gets a token, it can directly use the token to revoke resources. Besides, we use a smart contract to implement our proposed scheme and carrying out a series of experiments on the test network of Ethereum. The experimental results show that our SAFC is feasible.},

Special attention is paid to smart contracts, on the basis of which trust relations are formed between the parties to the transaction. The authors also used statistical data to assess the socio-economic benefits and identify the main ad-vantages and risks of implementing blockchain technology in the public procurement management system. Smart contracts based on blockchain can provide financial stability, reduce the cost of storing and transporting documents. Thanks to the blockchain, it will be possible to avoid corruption. The blockchain ensures the reliability of the conclusion of the contract and guarantees its execution on the basis of smart contracts. Implementation of blockchain within public procurement system will require investments not only into software development and digital infrastructure, but also into cybersecurity.},

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps.},

In the past, researchers have used blockchain technology for reputation systems. Smart contracts are computer protocols which have the primary objective to supervise, implement, or validate performances or negotiations of contracts. However, through a systematic literature review, in this paper, we find that the existing literature has not proposed a framework that facilitates the interchangeable use of smart contracts for blockchain-based reputation systems. We adopt a systematic literature review from 30 relevant studies and the data from them were extracted before identifying the research gaps. As a solution to the research gaps, we propose the FarMed framework for creating an intelligent framework that will execute Ethereum smart contact-based reputation systems and develop reliable blockchain-based protocols for transferring reputation values from one provider to another. We briefly explain our proposed framework before concluding with our future work.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in ecommerce and changing consumer preferences have contributed to the growing popularity of online auctioning platforms such as eBay. Online platforms provide some advantages to consumers such as product variety, deals on prices and mitigate geographical barriers. Nevertheless, existing auction platforms are centralized and depend on third-party intermediaries for transaction settlement. As a result, online platforms raise critical concerns regarding data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability as potential bidders have to trust the organizer for legitimacy of bids. Thus, adopting a decentralized approach using blockchain technology can transform the auction process, eliminating intermediaries, ensure transparency and reduce transaction costs. In this paper, we propose a general framework for decentralized auctions leveraging (i) Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track bids, (ii) decentralized storage systems to upload documents related to bidding and (iii) trusted timer oracles that act as gateway between smart contract and external data feeds. In the proposed solution, we develop detailed algorithms that define the working principles of the Smart contract for the auction process. We present detailed cost analysis of the solution to demonstrate economic feasibility, providing a secure, transparent and reliable approach to online auctions.},

	abstract = {Agricultural risks associated with weather events, soil conditions, diseases, and pests have risen in recent years due to climate change. These risks have burdened farmers with the shock of financial stress and endangered the region’s food security. Despite increasing risks, notable risk management tools like agricultural insurance have not effectively reached marginal farmers in developing economies. This can be attributed to the fact that existing centralized agricultural information systems lack trust factors in sharing and accessing agricultural risk data, which is accompanied by processing delays in insurance payouts. To this end, the emergence of promising technologies like blockchain helps establish trust and automates insurance-based payments with smart contracts. This work proposes a framework called AgriSSIOracle with two key contributions. The first is to have a trusted agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) data sharing that employs blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and provable credentials. Second is the decentralized oracle-based access control mechanism for smart contracts in agricultural insurance. A method for privacy-preserved authentication and data provenance for agricultural IoT devices is developed with SSI-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Next, the IoT data sharing scheme is illustrated using publish–subscribe and request–response communication patterns based on the device data credentials. Finally, the decentralized oracle mechanism for smart contracts is built based on multiparty computation for risk-related data access. The implementation of the framework is realized using a permissioned identity blockchain called Hyperledger Indy and Ethereum, which is a public blockchain for smart contracts. The security and privacy analysis confirms that the AgriSSIOracle framework ensures trust factors, particularly authenticity, privacy, data provenance, data integrity, and access control. The framework is evaluated with respect to the transaction throughput, latency, credential issue-verify-revoke time, and resource utilization metrics. The evaluation results prove that the AgriSSIOracle solution is scalable and efficient and meets the requirements of real-time deployment.},

	abstract = {Electric demand flexibility in buildings is highly dependent on occupant behavior. Evaluating and incentivizing these behaviors can provide grid-responsive support and encourage demand response (DR) participation. To achieve these goals, we developed an infrastructure for connecting Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to a distributed ledger (blockchain network) for long-term monitoring of energy and environmental performance. This study presents a novel Blockchain + IoT paradigm for the building science research community, applied in a real-world application. This Blockchain + IoT Network (BIN) uses Raspberry Pi minicomputers as platforms for connecting sensors to a blockchain network, to provide and analyze real-time indoor environmental quality (IEQ), energy, and carbon intensity data. As part of the study, we propose various metrics to evaluate the environmental footprints of building users. Novel algorithms for normalizing energy usage and carbon intensity, with consideration of a variety of related environmental factors, are executed as smart contracts on the blockchain network. All measurements and the smart contract transactions are reported and visualized on live dashboards. The use of smart contract allocates tokens based on the reward algorithms to incentivize individuals’ energy conservation, and similarly to DR pricing, can help influence occupant consumption patterns towards carbon reduction goals. We further test the smart contract’s algorithm in relation to real sensor data we have collected in two case studies: single-unit households and carbon intensity in the energy market. The combination of proposed metrics translates measured sensor data into token awards, demonstrates upper and lower limits dictated by the grid generation mix profile, and indicates that there is the potential for load shifting to minimize carbon emissions without considering the scale of consumption.},

	abstract = {Due to the fast-pacing development of technology in the healthcare domain, many problems arise surrounding the security and privacy preservation of medical data. Secure authentication on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is essential. The lack of security in critical and sensitive information of IoMT may lead to high-risk issues in patient privacy. When new data is transmitted from the sensor node, it cannot be assured as authenticated data. Therefore, a blockchain-based system is needed. Such a system allows healthcare providers to access the health records of patients in a more secured authentication-based approach across various network connections. In this paper, a new secure authentication approach using machine learning is proposed. To identify the dynamic time attack detection and authentication in an IoMT environment, this work implements K-Nearest neighbour (KNN) and machine learning using smart contract (KNN-MLSC). It improves security, reduces latency, and maintains health data privacy for both physicians and patients. The accuracy of KNN-MLSC got 0.96 compared with KNN using a smart contract. Also, the results showed that KNN-MLSC has the minimum computation time.},

To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, a port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain (Fabric-PSChain) is designed and implemented. In the proposed system, four smart contracts are developed by taking advantage of the blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-free, distributed consensus, combined with the Role-Based Access Control Policy (RBACP), realizing the functions of access control policy formulation, enterprise list query, cargo order uploading, and order query. At the same time, the regulator node is added to the Fabric-PSchain system to enhance the credibility and security of data and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Experimental results show that the Fabric-PSChain system has vital confidentiality and data sharing that can speed up the operation of the port supply chain business and has significant application value for the shipping logistics industry.},

In the IoV scenario, the secure exchange of traffic warning data is necessary to guarantee the safety of pedestrians, vehicles, and public transport facilities. However, there remain a series of challenging issues to achieve data secure sharing while ensuring efficiency. Current solutions such as the data outsourcing storage of traditional centralized cloud servers may cause information leakage due to their incomplete credibility. To address these problems mentioned above, this paper proposes an edge-aided searchable data sharing scheme based on blockchain for IoV in a 5G environment. First, the proposed scheme stores the search index of the keyword and the hash value of the data ciphertext on the blockchain to ensure its integrity and authenticity, and the smart contract automatically verifies the search trapdoor. And then, an edge caching mechanism is designed to quickly feedback on users’ retrieval needs based on a cloud-edge collaboration model. In addition, attribute-based searchable encryption is used to ensure that only the users who meet the access attributes and policy can decrypt the encrypted traffic warning data, which can achieve fine-grained access control and keyword search simultaneously. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our scheme is secure and more efficient compared with other schemes.},

But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting. By using blockchain our proposed system ensures security, privacy, and integrity. This system provides voter anonymity by keeping the voter information as a hash in the blockchain. It also provides fairness by keeping the casted vote encrypted till the ending time of the election. After ending time, the voter can verify their casted vote, ensuring verifiability. To test our protocol, we put it on Ethereum 2.0, a blockchain platform that uses Solidity as a programming language to create smart contracts. The adoption of smart contracts provides a safe means for performing voter verification, ensuring the correctness of voting results, making the counting system public, and protecting against fraudulent activities. We analyzed the system’s performance based on security and gas costs. It improves in terms of security characteristics and the related cost for the necessary infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts.},

Several approaches exist in literature to address this issue. They are mainly limited to detect hoax activities by characterizing the message nature and detecting provenance of messages. However, unless hoaxes are detected, they continue to propagate across social media nodes. This work aims at reducing the dissemination of hoaxes across group of users. Relying on social graph structure, this research develops a mechanism based on smart contract logics to prevent a group to consume a fake post. To achieve this objective, we used a smart contract to exploit a trust index computed based on message characteristics and group features such as graph density, group status, group degree, group acceptability. Based on the value of trust index, the message is forwarded or blocked. Experiments realized on groups of different characteristics revealed that the proposed smart contract is even able to reactively block a fake post of the same nature than the group type. Results indicate that the proportion of targeted groups could be reduced even if their interests match with the message subject. This research is an important step forward to anti-promote hoaxes with the novelty of exploiting smart contract approach to contain their propagation.},

	abstract = {On-site construction environmental monitoring (OCEM) can help to govern the behaviors of construction stakeholders in terms of pollutant emissions and environmental protection. Current OCEM systems, nevertheless, were built utilizing a centralized architecture, such as the government's local database, which leads to information imbalance and disputes among multiple stakeholders. When there are no trustworthy data records to justify construction companies' compliance, for example, arguments or even conflicts may emerge between neighboring residents and the contractors. Blockchain has the potential to be a reliable platform for environmental monitoring due to its decentralization, immutability, transparency, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. However, there has been limited investigation into the blockchain's possibilities in OCEM. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled framework for OCEM. To begin, an overall conceptual framework was created, in which construction pollutant data was collected via sensors and then uploaded to the blockchain network. Then, based on the consensus algorithm, the on-chained information flow was introduced. Smart contracts were programmed to automatically monitor the level of construction pollutants and evaluate environmental performance. Finally, a case study was carried out to validate the theoretical viability of the proposed framework in a laboratory environment, in which a blockchain prototype based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture was presented. The results indicate that blockchain can assist OCEM by supplying trustworthy environmental data and allowing for continuous monitoring. This research investigated the blockchain's potential in OCEM and created a prototype system that can be fine-tuned for use in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today’s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.},

	abstract = {The development of cloud computing and the Internet of things (IOT) attracts more and more enterprises to outsource the data from their Industrial Internet of things (IIOT) to cloud servers in order to save operating costs and improve efficiency. However, in this environment, protecting the security and privacy of data storage is an important challenge for IIOT and cloud server provider (CSP). Data auditing could allow data owner discover malicious behaviors of CSP which destroy their outsourced data. The public auditing authorizes the trusted third part auditor (TPA) to audit the owner’s outsourced data and frees owner from regular tasks. However, the public auditing using TPA is considered a centralized auditing, and the TPA is assumed totally honest, but it is difficult to find a reliable auditing organization. In this paper, a novel decentralized auditing smart contract in Ethereum is proposed. By replacing the TPA with a designed smart contract, a decentralized auditing scheme (Dredas) is proposed, where anyone can obtain the auditing result from Ethereum without worrying about semi-honest TPA. Compared with traditional auditing, apart from being able to perform traditional auditing functions, Dredas has three important benefits over previous work. First, the random values of challenge are more secure. Dredas chooses the current blockchain nonce as a random seed to prevent any party forging random values. Secondly, in order to achieve a safe, regular, proactive auditing, the protocol writes the auditing rules into the blockchain, and uses the number blocks on the Ethereum as the security timestamp. Finally, data owner, user and CSP must pay some ether for smart contract as deposit. This way not only inhibits the malicious behavior of these three parties, but also makes it more reasonable in real life. We implement Dredas to show that the computation costs are reasonable and efficient.},

	abstract = {Recently, with the deterioration of the environment, increasing companies choose horizontal cooperation to achieve the goal of reducing environmental pollution and cost in the urban distribution industry. However, companies worry that the business information is leaked in the process of horizontal cooperation. This kind of mistrust often leads to the failure of horizontal cooperation. The emergence of blockchain technology has become a great means to resolve trust problem between partners, which ensures data sharing and trust through peer-to-peer, consensus mechanism and encryption technology. In response, this study proposes architecture of blockchain-based urban distribution system for horizontal cooperation that analyzes the components and layers of the urban distribution. Meanwhile, a smart contract, the innovative applications of blockchain, is designed to match the resource of supply and demand to design the distribution routes in the urban distribution system. To achieve the above goal, an open vehicle routing model of urban distribution taking into account environmental pollution factors is developed as the mathematical logic of smart contract, which aims at the lowest total cost including fixed, fuel, penalty, carbon emission and pollutant emission costs. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm is developed to support the implementation of smart contract, and the effectiveness of the smart contract is verified through a real case. This study narrows the knowledge gap in applying blockchain technology to urban distribution, and has brought contributions to the fields of blockchain and urban distribution. Finally, the limitation and future research direction are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an information carrier based on the Internet and traditional telecommunications networks. Access control is an important part of the service architecture, which can effectively solve the security issues in IoT. Therefore, many solutions adopt the access control to solve some security problems. However, these existing solutions cannot easily deploy access control in the IoT. As a decentralized, non-tamperable, and highly credible distributed ledger technology, blockchain is in line with the current trend of network development. To improve the transparency, non-tampering of the access control process and traceability and auditability of access flow changes, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the IoT, which uses a combination of on-chain and off-chain to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain. On the one hand, we deploy policy decision points (PDP) and other components on the smart contract in the form of chain code to better judge and execute decision-making. On the other hand, we put policy administration points (PAP) in the off-chain organization to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain and make better access flow transformation and traceability. Ultimately, we concluded through feasibility analysis that our solution can maintain high throughput in a large-scale transaction volume environment.},

Based on the combination of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform and G-Cloud solutions, our proposal consists of the design of an e-Participation model that uses a tokenizable system of the actions and processes undertaken by citizens in participatory processes providing incentives to promote greater participation in public affairs. In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process.

This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges.

The low cost of access and fast spread speed greatly enriches people’s spiritual life, but it also poses great challenges to the protection of intellectual property rights. Nowadays, although the intellectual property rights of music works have been better valued and protected, there are still some problems that limit the development of the music industry and affect the users’ experience. For example, the copyrights of different music works may be exclusively represented by different companies, resulting in limited choices for users and vicious competition among music operating companies, which affects the users’ experience and is not conducive to the long-term development of the music industry. In order to solve the above problems, we present a decentralized music copyright operation management system based on Blockchain technology. By using the Blockchain’s shared ledger mechanism and smart contracts as the basic framework of the Ethereum platform, we realize decentralized music copyright management. The system not only protects copyright better, but also coordinates the interests of creators, copyright owners, operators and users, which is beneficial to the further development of the music industry, and creates more value and better experience for users.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, which allows energy consumers/producers to directly trade with each other, is one of the new paradigms driven by the decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization of the energy supply chain. Additionally, the rise of blockchain technology suggests unprecedented socio-economic benefits for energy systems, especially when coupled with P2P energy trading. Despite such future prospects in energy systems, three key challenges might hinder the full integration of P2P energy trading and blockchain. First, it is quite complicated to design a decentralized P2P market that keeps a fair balance between economic efficiency and information privacy. Secondly, with the proliferation of storage devices, new P2P market designs are needed to account for their inter-temporal dependencies. Thirdly, a practical implementation of blockchain technology for P2P trading is required, which can facilitate efficient trading in a secured and fraud-resilient way, while eliminating any intermediaries’ costs. In this paper, we develop a new decentralized P2P energy trading platform to address all the aforementioned challenges. Our platform consists of two key layers: market and blockchain. The market layer features a parallel and short-term pool-structured auction and is cleared using a novel decentralized Ant-Colony Optimization method. This market arrangement guarantees a near-optimally efficient market solution, preserves players’ privacy, and allows inter-temporal market products trading. The blockchain layer offers a high level of automation, security, and fast real-time settlements through smart contract implementation. Finally, using real-world data, we simulate the functionality of the platform regarding energy trading, market clearing, smart contract operations, and blockchain-based settlements.},

The challenges that the propositions deal with include those associated with an unfavorable institutional environment, high costs, technological limitations, unequal power distribution among supply chain partners and porosity and opacity of value delivery networks.},

	abstract = {In the supply chain ecosystem, trust among transacting parties is a critical component to ensure profitability. However, participating parties act selfishly in their interest resulting in a sub-optimal output for transactions. This makes it difficult for trust to be established and an effective equilibrium to be reached among parties. Therefore, it is essential to ensure coordination among all parties and for all parties to collaborate effectively to avoid this problem. This helps to create a favourable environment and ensures profitability on the supply chain. Previous works have attempted to achieve this by making use of contracting mechanisms to regulate IoT devices and nodes on the network. In these systems, parties are enticed to act in a way so that profit achieved in the supply chain is maximized. However, these contracting mechanisms utilized are centralized and can easily be compromised. Also, these contracts are not enforced by a framework that ensures the effective establishment of trust among parties on the supply chain. Also, equilibrium remains in-established due to the complexity and lack of an effective system to regulate behaviour effectively. In this work, we design a blockchain-adaptive framework that incentivizes participants to work together on the supply chain to establish an equilibrium. We show through a proof of Concept, that the blockchain possesses the necessary attributes needed in establishing a Nash Equilibrium and can be used to coordinate the supply chain in complex scenarios to ensure security, trust, and profit. Using game theory models, we develop novel approaches and prove mathematically that the blockchain is more efficient in establishing a supply chain equilibrium among parties, ensuring fairness among various parties. Additionally, we utilize smart contracts to calculate each participating party’s expected payoff and profit. We also attempt to reduce the level of uncertainties across the supply chain by presenting profit-maximizing parties. Here the transparency provided by the blockchain provides a means to collate information relevant for making effective decisions on the blockchain which proves relevant in multi-complex supply chain networks such as aircraft, and vehicle manufacturing and assembling networks. Here, parties are thus incentivized to make the right decisions. We observe through our test that the blockchain provides all parties with the best payoff that satisfies all parties by incorporating each individual’s decisions on the supply chain, ensuring trust and equilibrium are established. The implementation of our work was achieved using standard blockchain networks. Our results show the cost-efficiency and feasibility of our proposed idea.},

A concurrent mixed-method design was adopted to (a) identify the industry's perspective on what advanced technologies can be accepted to address SOP issues through a questionnaire survey, and (b) identify the use of advanced technologies through a live construction project as a case study. Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done. This research contributes new and practical insights into the application and integration of smart sensors, oracles, BIM, blockchain technology and smart contracts in addressing SOP issues in the construction industry.},

Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource “scarcity” and on the environment.},

In this context, E-Portfolio has been conceived as a promising tool for both professionals and employers, in assessing and providing guidance for further workplace learning. Nevertheless, the challenges in implementing E-Portfolio are daunting, particularly with regard to lack of interoperability while collecting and sharing the competency evidences across multiple organizations and institutions. The increasing move towards professional (learner)-centered interoperability poses additional challenges that needs to be addressed to realize the full potential of E-Portfolio in the context of Industry 4.0. This work puts emphasize on realization of professional-centered interoperability and proposes a framework leveraging the advantage of blockchain, decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, smart contract and session management for E-Portfolio creation and sharing evidences across multiple organizations without comprising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the shared evidences. The proof of concept simulation on Ethereum official test network Rinkeby demonstrates the feasibility of proposed framework in practice. In addition, the evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness from the aspects of cost and security as a potential solution for implementing E-Portfolio and helping the professional to remain competitive in global labor market.},

In this paper, we present an advanced protected blockchain-based consultation model for minor medical conditions. Our model not only ensures users’ privacy but by incorporating a calculation model, it also offers an opportunity for consulting end-users to voluntarily take part in the consultation process. Our work proposes a smart contract based on machine learning to be implemented for the prediction of a score of a professional who consults based on various prioritized parameters. This is done by using word2vec and TF-IDF weighting to classify the question and cosine similarity scores for detailed orientation analysis. Based on this score, the patient is charged, and simultaneously, the responder is awarded ether. An incentivized method leads to more accessible healthcare while reducing the cost itself.},

	abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) aims to seamlessly manage all products and information and knowledge generated throughout the product lifecycle for achieving business competitiveness. Conventionally, PLM is implemented based on standalone and centralized systems provided by software vendors. The information of PLM is hardly to be integrated and shared among the cooperating parties. It is difficult to meet the requirements of the openness, interoperability and decentralization of the Industry 4.0 era. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle.},

However, limited resources and a lack of incentivization affect the performance of edge video streaming systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient Joint computing Offloading and Resource Allocation (JORA) method for blockchain-supported edge video streaming systems (BEVS). Specifically, we develop a novel incentive mechanism based on the blockchain smart contract to enable automatic incentivization. Meanwhile, we customize a system prototype of BEVS on Amazon EC2 using Apache Storm. Preliminary experiments with the customized prototype reveal the coupling impacts of the offloading mode, the allocation scheme, and video redundancy on system performance and resource demand. Motivated by the results, we formulate joint computing offloading, resource allocation, and video adaptive compression as an optimization problem. We transform the original problem into a convex problem and a mixed-integer programming problem (MIP). We then develop an algorithm based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to solve the original problem in an iterative way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves full resource utilization and an effective trade-off between energy consumption and accuracy.},

More specifically, European Union regulations mandate food producers to trace all raw materials/ingredients used throughout their supply chain operations. Consumers also place high expectations on food supply chains (FSC) with specific emphasis on facets related to safety. However, the complexity of modern FSC networks and their fragmentation act as barriers for the development of sound traceability mechanisms. This paper aims to develop a distributed functional model to provide decentralized and automated FSC traceability based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. For assessing the feasibility of the proposed modeling approach, a food traceability use-case scenario is presented. The applicability of the model is further illustrated by the development of a fully functional smart contract and a local private blockchain. The overall benefits of the proposed model are assessed based on a set of predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The results are of significant value to both practitioners and researchers.},

To this end, blockchain is an emerging distributive technology that guarantees data authenticity and integrity by providing decentralized, immutable, and traceable data storage. However, directly integrating BIM with blockchain risks leaking sensitive data, since a blockchain is a transparent network insofar as shared information (including sensitive data) can be disclosed to all members without access control. Therefore, this paper proposes a confidentiality-minded framework (CMF) for blockchain-based design collaboration. The major innovations are twofold. First, an access control model is developed in the CMF to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive BIM data in a blockchain ledger. Second, new design strategies are developed in CMF to facilitate design coordination within the access-controlled blockchain network. An illustrative design example validates the feasibility and performance of the proposed CMF, which has acceptable latency and storage cost. The results also show that the sensitive BIM data are effectively kept confidential when project members collaborate within the CMF.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the development and adoption of blockchain technology in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) because of its authenticity and traceability. However, increasing ITS devices impose grand challenges in privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing. Recent research has demonstrated that integrating searchable symmetric encryption in blockchain enables privacy-preserving data sharing among ITS devices. However, existing solutions focus only on single-keyword searches over encrypted ITS data on the blockchain and suffer from privacy and efficiency issues when extended to multi-keyword scenarios. This work proposes a bloom filter-based multi-keyword search protocol for ITS data with enhanced efficiency and privacy preservation. We design a bloom filter to select a low-frequency keyword from the multiple keywords input by the ITS data owner. The low-frequency keyword can filter out a large portion of the ITS data from the search result, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, each identifier-keyword pair is attached with a pseudorandom tag that enables the completion of a search operation in only one round. In this manner, privacy is preserved because there are no intermediate rounds and results. In addition to the multi-keyword search protocol, we specify the addition and deletion protocols to enable dynamic updates of data records. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of the protocols. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-keyword search protocol saves 14.67\% query time and 59.96\% financial cost.},

The integration of blockchain technology in farming is gaining attention for its potential to migrate from the centralized and monopolistic model that shapes today’s food value chain. This paper highlights the fact that most of today’s blockchain-based farming frameworks focus on food tracking and traceability. Only rarely does research focus on the design of digital marketplaces to support the trading of agricultural goods between farmers and potentially interested third party stakeholders; equally rarely are performance evaluations performed for the proposed frameworks. The latter is where this paper contributes the most by, not only proposing a novel blockchain-based farming marketplace platform (called “FarMarketplace”), but also a comprehensive methodology to help software solution integrators to better understand and measure how a given configuration setting of such a platform can influence the overall quality of service performance in the long run.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of edge computing technologies, smart healthcare significantly improves people’s lives by collecting and analyzing health data in real time. However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users’ privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.},

	abstract = {Recommendation systems provide ease and convenience for users to address information overload problems while interacting with online platforms such as social media and e-commerce. However, it raises several questions about privacy, especially for users who prefer to remain anonymous, especially on online social networks (OSNs). Moreover, due to the commercialization of online users' data, some service providers sell users' data to third parties at the blind side of the users, which leads to trust issues between users and service providers. Such matters call for a system that gives online users much-needed control and autonomy of their data. With the advancement of blockchain technology, many research institutions are experimenting with decentralized technologies to resolve the OSN user dilemma of privacy intrusion against third parties and hacks. To resolve these limitations, we propose RecGuard, a privacy preservation blockchain-based network system. We developed two smart contracts, RG-SH and RG-ST, to ensure the security and privacy of user data. The RG-SH manages user data, whereas the RG-ST stores data. A graph convolutional network (GCN) was integrated with the blockchain-based system to detect malicious nodes. Finally, we implemented our framework prototype on a locally simulated network. The analysis and experiment results show that the proposed scheme demonstrates the effectiveness and privacy of users in our framework.},

	abstract = {Regulatory changes in different countries regarding self-consumption and growing public concern about the environment are encouraging the establishment of community microgrids. These community microgrids integrate a large number of small-scale distributed energy resources and offers a solution to enhance power system reliability and resilience. This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles, mimicking the most typical layout of cities. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid, without requiring interaction with the distributed system operator. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal.},

However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is “Technical Characteristics”, and the top three sub-enablers are: “blockchain smart contract”, “blockchain security,” and “tracking product components”, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT.

It enables visibility and caters to the consumer requirements of transparency and quality assurance. Textile and clothing industry is one such example that requires traceability implementation to address prevailing problems of information asymmetry and low visibility. Customers find it difficult to access product data that can facilitate ethical buying practices or assure product authenticity. Besides, it is challenging for stakeholders to share crucial information in an insecure environment with risk of data manipulations and fear of losing information advantage. In this context, this study investigates and proposes a blockchain-based traceability framework for traceability in multi-tier textile and clothing supply chain. It conceptualizes the interaction of supply chain partners, and related network architecture at the organizational level and smart contract and transaction validation rules at the operational level. To illustrate the application of the proposed framework, the study presents an example of organic cotton supply chain using blockchain with customized smart contract and transaction rules. It finally demonstrates the applicability of the developed blockchain by testing it under two parameters. The proposed system can build a technology-based trust among the supply chain partners, where the distributed ledger can be used to store and authenticate supply chain transactions. Further, the blockchain-based traceability system would provide a unique opportunity, flexibility, and authority to all partners to trace-back their supply network and create transparent and sustainable supply chain.},

The faulty meters may increase the cost to consumers. The existing solutions lack in detecting the energy theft accurately and preserving the privacy of the consumers.

It deploys smart contracts viz; energy supply, energy consumption and energy theft detection on the hyperledger besu. Here, the supplied energy to the consumers is monitored using the energy supply contract, whereas the energy consumption is reported to the grid utility through energy consumption contract that preserves privacy of the consumers’ energy consumption data. The energy theft detection contract detects the energy theft and faulty meters accurately. The proposed system is validated using a test-bed at NIT Goa by considering the test scenario of energy theft and faulty smart meters. It achieves {\textgreater}98\% accuracy in energy theft detection with sufficient throughput ({\textgreater}98.37 tps) and an affordable latency ({\textless}0.42 seconds) of energy data transactions, while fulfilling the energy theft detection requirements in smart grid NAN.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are becoming increasingly popular in the last years. They collect reviews concerning several types of items (e.g., shops, professionals, services, songs or videos) in order to rank them according to a given criterion, and to suggest the most relevant ones to their users. However, most of the currently used RSs exhibit two main drawbacks: they are based on a centralized control model and they do not provide reward mechanisms to encourage the participation of users. To deal with these challenges, the architectures of current RSs could be enhanced through blockchain technology, thus providing novel solutions to decentralize them. As a matter of fact, the blockchain technology could be successfully adopted in this context because smart contracts would allow the decentralization of system control, while cryptocurrency and tokens could be used to implement the reward mechanism. In the light of the above considerations, this manuscript presents a decentralized rating framework aimed to support the users of RSs based on blockchain technology, providing a token-based reward mechanism that remunerates users submitting their reviews to incentivize their participation. Moreover, the proposed system provides a flexible strategy to rank items, allowing users to choose among different functions to combine reviews to obtain item ranking. The performance and the cost of using the proposed system have been evaluated on the Ropsten Ethereum test network. For instance, our experiments have shown that the median time required to store a batch of 35 ratings is about 47 s, while the average time required to obtain the score of an item having 6000 ratings is less than 2.5 s.},

	abstract = {This paper designs a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy-backed token market for prosumers under blockchain technology. The prosumers in the presented market are classified into buyers and sellers based on their net generation. Another set of prosumers is electric vehicle (EV) owners that participate in the proposed energy token market via the storage capacity of their EVs. Using smart contracts, all market players can engage in bilateral (P2P) transactions of energy-backed tokens with other prosumers at the agreed price and with their existing market via real-time pricing. Furthermore, the buyers can participate in DR programs as virtual generators without the interference of a third party and shift their load based on their preferences to the hours with an abundant local generation or low market price. To avoid inflation and “false welfare” in the energy-backed token market, this paper applies a demurrage mechanism to lower the redemption value of energy tokens. With this mechanism in place, the buyers and sellers try to minimize the time interval between token purchase and consumption and between token generation and selling. A decentralized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme is developed to clear the proposed fully-decentralized energy-backed token market in the presence of EVs and the demurrage mechanism. This approach protects the players’ privacy while ensuring solution feasibility. The simulation results suggest that the presence of EVs enhances the freedom of the prosumers in choosing their energy peers and increases their total welfare by 20 percent.},

The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of E-commerce, more and more people are used to shopping online, in which the reputation scores of sellers play an important role in helping consumers purchase satisfactory products. However, in the existing E-commerce environments, the reputation scores of users (including sellers and buyers) are centrally computed and stored on a centralized cloud server, which might make errors or even engage in fraud and forgery. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system (BC-DRS) in the E-commerce environment, i.e., online shopping. In this system, the product information including product descriptions and comments is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the corresponding address is returned, and the returned address and the reputation scores of users are stored on the blockchain. The reputation evaluation is implemented by designing and deploying a smart contract on the blockchain. Different from the traditional centralized reputation systems (CRSs), the proposed BC-DRS can protect the product information and users reputation scores from intentional and unintentional modifications, since it is very hard to change any data stored in the blockchain and IPFS. Also, as the reputation scores of users are computed and updated by all the ratings of their transactions weighted by the practical transaction factors, it is effective to resist the common attacks, i.e., unfair rating and collusion. In addition, this system also contains a monetary incentive mechanism for the evaluation, which is helpful to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed BC-DRS is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed BC-DRS has desirable usability and reliability.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose a methodology to integrate Blockchain with IPFS to enhance the throughput and optimize the memory. As a case study marks card validation application is being developed on the Ethereum framework considering Geth and Parity clients. Blockchain consensus protocol, i.e., proof of work (POW) and proof of stake (POS), are used to build smart contracts and process transactions. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is integrated with Blockchain to enhance the throughput and performance of the application. The results indicate that Blockchain integrated with IPFS performs better by optimizing the memory and reducing the transaction delay. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed approach reduces the transaction processing cost by 10\% and enhances the throughput by 8\% compared to the Fileshare and BlockIPFS techniques.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has exposed the privacy of positive patients to the public, which will lead to violations of users’ rights and even threaten their lives. A privacy-preserving scheme involving virus-infected positive patients is proposed by us. The traditional ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has the features of enhanced plaintext security and fine-grained access control. However, the encryption process requires the high computational performance of the device, which puts a high strain on resource-limited devices. After semi-honest users successfully decrypt the data, they will get the real private data, which will cause serious privacy leakage problems. Traditional cloud-based data management architectures are extremely vulnerable in the face of various cyberattacks. To address the above challenges, a verifiable ABE scheme based on blockchain and local differential privacy is proposed, using LDP to perturb the original data locally to a certain extent to resist collusion attacks, outsourcing encryption and decryption to corresponding service providers to reduce the pressure on mobile terminals, and deploying smart contracts in combination with blockchain for fair execution by all parties to solve the problem of returning wrong search results in a semi-honest cloud server. Detailed security proofs are performed through the defined security goals, which shows that the proposed scheme is indeed privacy-protective. The experimental results show that the scheme is optimized in terms of data accuracy, computational overhead, storage performance, and fairness. In terms of efficiency, it greatly reduces the local load, enhances personal privacy protection, and has high practicality as well as reliability. As far as we know, it is the first case of applying the combination of LDP technology and blockchain to a tracing system, which not only mitigates poisoning attacks on user data, but also improves the accuracy of the data, thus making it easier to identify infected contacts and making a useful contribution to health prevention and control efforts.},

	abstract = {Longstanding assumptions underlying strategic alliances, such as agency theory, are actively being revoked by dynamics in the new economy. The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel ‘Blockchain Agency Theory’ that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike.},

	abstract = {Facilitated by the improved prefabrication rate and polymerization degree using Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), fit-out operations are converged with the off-site production and on-site assembly of prefabricated modules. Information technologies are used for MiC fit-out management and heterogeneous digital twins are generated. However, flexible collaboration of digital twins is hard to achieve and synchronized information sharing among transdisciplinary stakeholders is also hindered by “Islands of Information”. Therefore, this paper develops a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform for MiC fit-out operations. Firstly, Integrated Domain-Driven Design (IDDD) model is proposed for information integration and interoperation in cross-domain construction projects. Secondly, based on IDDD, digital twins in various domains are integrated for seamless and transparent collaboration in MiC fit-out. Thirdly, Petri net-based workflow model is applied for collaboration of multi-domain digital twins under versioning smart contract, where net structure and behavior attributes facilitate the automatic control during off-site and on-site MiC fit-out processes.},

	abstract = {Distributed voltage regulation schemes within active distribution networks (ADNs) are receiving plenty of attention because they reduce latency bottlenecks. However, previous schemes often employ a trusted moderator to govern agent communication, thereby exposing potential trust issues that may affect agent performance. Blockchain technology can avoid the need for intermediaries, since it is a fully decentralized network that is governed by agents using distributed consensus mechanisms. Thus, this paper proposes a blockchain-based system for voltage regulation in ADNs that provides a competitive marketplace wherein agents can rationally bid for voltage regulation services. The proposed system utilizes a smart contract that i) enables asynchronous negotiation between agents to mitigate multiple violations simultaneously using the extended contract net protocol (ECNP), and ii) maintains a credit score that reflects the trustworthiness of an agent in resolving voltage violations. The proposed system also develops a bidding and pricing scheme for voltage regulation services that considers both active and reactive power contributions. A permissioned blockchain implementation is used to ensure that only known agents are permitted to access the system. The proposed system is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric platform, where simulations executed on a 69 bus system demonstrate the system’s ability to mitigate multiple voltage violations simultaneously. As demonstrated by the simulation results, the highlight of the main contribution of the paper is the ability of the proposed system to mitigate multiple voltage violations simultaneously via the ECNP, thereby utilizing less bidding cycles to resolve voltage violations as compared to the original contract net protocol.},

	abstract = {The concept of digital twin was originally proposed to assist product lifecycle management through the high-fidelity virtual product. In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method. The results show that the proposed method can solve the abovementioned data management problems simultaneously.},

However, as different companies’ data are scattered on different cloud platforms, it is difficult to have a unified control and reliable accountability for the operation of cloud data, which obstructs the establishment of platforms and cooperation. In this paper, to address the problems above, we propose a Cloud–Blockchain Fusion Framework (CBFF) to achieve data accountability among multiple clouds. CBFF improves the trustworthiness of operation to cloud data by designing secure mechanisms between clouds and blockchain. It designs a unified data Naming and Addressing Mechanism to publish and locate cloud data globally in a multi-cloud environment. Also, it proposes the Operation Tracing Mechanism to achieve reliable operation logging and tracing. With CBFF, we present a prototype implementation system using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and Alibaba Cloud Computing. Our system could provide secure data uploading, sharing, and updating among multiple clouds.

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are witnessing increased utilization throughout the world as an alternative to fossil–fueled vehicles. The extensive deployment of EVs can bring challenges to the grid if not properly integrated. Such challenges, however, could be exploited as opportunities if the huge unused capacity of the battery storage in millions of EVs are utilized for ancillary services to the grid and peer–to–peer (PtP) energy trade. Given that there is at least one human user per vehicle, human input must be considered to improve the scheduling process. To that end, this paper presents a new algorithm for bidirectional smart charging of EVs considering user preferences, PtP energy trade, and provision of ancillary services to the grid. The preferences of an EV user as input to the model are embedded into the scheduling process enabling the model to be adaptive to various conditions. Optimization slack variables are utilized for optimal management of EV battery SOC and energy allocation for multiple services. New indices are developed and introduced for quantification of the EV participation in ancillary services and PtP transactions. Real–world data has been collected and utilized for model specification and simulation to make the assumptions more realistic. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed model are validated using numerical studies. The results indicate that incorporating users’ preferences into the scheduling process would improve the aggregated revenue generated by the EV scheduling model which in turn could offset the charging costs by up to 100\%. Further, an increase of about 90\% in peer-to-peer energy transactions among EVs and 11\% in ancillary services provision to the grid are achieved through the developed user-centric smart charging model.},

	abstract = {User-centric data sharing is essential to encourage citizens' active participation in the digital economy. One key to smart cities, a form of digital economy, is the promotion of public use of citizen data. Nevertheless, it is not easy to utilize data without citizens’ consent. In this study, we take a technological approach to these issues. User-managed access (UMA) is a well-known framework for delegating resource access rights to others on the Internet. In UMA, authorization mechanisms are designed to be centralized so that resource owners can centrally manage access rights for various resources stored in different domains. However, the lack of transparency in the authorization mechanism is a barrier to its implementation in large-scale systems such as smart cities. In this study, we developed a blockchain-based cross-domain authorization architecture that enables a resource-sharing ecosystem in which organizations that wish to utilize data can freely trade with each other. The proposed architecture solves the transparency problem that conventional authorization systems have had by designing the authorization mechanism on blockchain technology. We implemented the proposed architecture as smart contracts and evaluated its processing performance. The resultant time required for delegating access rights and accessing resources was less than 500 ms. Furthermore, we found that the fluctuation in the processing time overhead was small. Based on these results, we conclude that performance degradation with the proposed architecture is minor.},

Nevertheless, integrated solutions that cover all the aspects of circular supply chain including network structure, business processes, and the products are still missing. This paper is an attempt to bridge this gap, through offering a workable solution to address the disconnected nature of blockchain adoption across construction procedures. Informed by the overall approach of design science research (DSR), the solution is created following the five-staged procedure of DSR: (1) problem identification, (2) treatment suggestion, (3) treatment design, (4) evaluation and (5) conclusion. Findings establish that the proposed solution is novel in several ways; it: (1) enables construction practitioners to share their building components information on a safe and immutable medium; (2) enables government authorities (i.e., city council) to track the treatment and delivery of hazardous products/materials; (3) supports the upstream circular economy design through fostering collaboration among ‘designers to designers’ and ‘designers to asset owners’ in a blockchain network; and (4) supports developing ‘a bank of reusable BIM families’, encouraging designers to use these items in their designs. Apart from these contributions, this study provides some fertile ground for future research. Chief among all: future studies can provide fully automated systems through integrating the solution presented here with the Internet of Things (IoT); and researchers that validate the workability of the proposed solution across various contexts and real-life projects in exposure to various settings and peculiarities.},

We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities. Evaluation and feedback from the company is also considered.},

Data sharing in consortium blockchain has provided a promising direction for efficient privacy preserving government data sharing.

Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach. The SOC approach can effectively identify different departments’ data retrieving requirements while efficiently sharing government data with trustworthiness in data content and controllability in data ownership. In particular, we utilize smart contracts to provide an onchain service to define data sharing agreements between government departments, which can identify ambiguous data retrieving requirements and formalize the process logic. We apply the SOC approach to a real world scenario and demonstrate that the SOC approach provides a feasible solution for secure and efficient sharing of data among government departments.},

	abstract = {The emergence of mobile edge computing can provide technical support for the development of Internet services and for coping with massive data traffic, thereby reducing network latency and ensuring efficient network operations and service delivery. However, the mobile edge computing environment is prone to data loss and privacy leakage, and data security and reliability cannot be guaranteed. The application of blockchain technology ensures the stability and dependability of data caching and transactions. In order to guarantee the security of data caching in the mobile edge computing environment and minimize the response time of caching servers, this paper proposes a decentralized data caching strategy in the mobile edge computing environment. The strategy uses a greedy algorithm to make the transmission delay of the requested content as small as possible under the multiple constraints of the storage space of each server and whether the content is cached on the server. To address the problem that data trading platforms are unable to afford the computation and storage of massive amounts of data and cannot guarantee that the data will not be leaked, this paper proposes a secure decentralized data transaction program. The scheme promotes the increase of transaction turnover rate and improves the revenue of both participating parties by establishing a buyer–seller matching algorithm. According to the experimental results, the proposed data caching strategy can improve the cache hit rate and reduce the transmission delay; the proposed data transaction solution can increase the revenue of both the data holder and the data buyer.},

With a peer-to-peer file sharing system, our platform enjoys high availability without the single failure point problem, mitigating the possibility of DDoS attacks.

	abstract = {The authors report on the Haier Group, a multinational business that primarily produces and markets manufactured goods and whose multiple business ecosystems are based not on traditional management control, but rather on distributed organizational and information technology platforms. These platforms enable people to create business value through participating in structured, financially incentivized but essentially voluntary relationships, and by engaging their human creative freedom to serve each other and co-create business value. For example, Haier Group manufactures large home appliances in China by an ecosystem made up of over four thousand mostly small teams making things and trading with each other by way of self-organized, self-negotiated lateral relationships that are smart-contract enabled, with no vertical middle managers. The case will be of interest to scholars because of the unique philosophy and practice, and the success of the approach at promoting both human development on a wide scale, and dramatic marketplace and business success of the ecosystem. The authors are scholars of business ecosystems. They report that this case was not understandable to them through the logic of their previous study of business ecosystems, a logic of strategy and organization design that presumes a limited, knowable, and closed model of each person and a management philosophy of control. In contrast, Haier Group presumes an unlimited, unknowable, and open image of each person, and a management philosophy of augmented personal creativity and platform-enabled coevolution with others. The authors provide a new term adapted from biology, human ecosystem, to highlight human values on which business ecosystems can vary, with important consequences for human development as well as business performance as traditionally measured. They define the term broadly and encourage others to join them in co-developing it.},

Later, a supervisable consensus scheme based on improved DPOS-PBFT (Delegated proof of stake-Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) was proposed. In the context of the development of the Internet of Things technology, the decentralized distributed computing paradigm is used to improve the blockchain smart contract technology, and the DPOS blockchain consensus mechanism is optimized based on the DPOS protocol of the credit model. In addition, through the dynamic grouping algorithm of credibility, the research ranks the credit level of the consensus nodes of the blockchain network, thus further realizing the supervision of the Internet of Things system. The results of the case analysis show that the success rate of the mechanism algorithm can still be maintained at about 97\% after 3000 user requests, the maximum delay remains below 8s after 3000 user requests, the minimum delay is always around 3s, the average delay is 2.38s, the overall performance of the algorithm is superior.

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis.},

As such, a disruption can wreak havoc to a supply chain network, rendering the ability of a firm to respond to these disruptions with appropriate recovery strategies paramount. In this paper, we analyze such recovery strategies in a supply chain network. The specific model we develop aims at predicting a disruption that may occur in a context where smart contracts have been implemented based on blockchain technology. Within this setting, we suggest appropriate measures to be undertaken by an organization to mitigate the disruption and avoid negative performance outcomes as much as possible. If the disruption cannot be avoided, the proposed genetic algorithm-based approach focuses on adopting re-active measures to manage the post-disruption reality. As such, we effectively integrate both pre- and post-disruption scenarios to offer wholistic decision-support in an integrated fashion, extending prior work which mostly developed guidance only for either pre- or post-disruption responses. Specifically, we study the performance of a complex multi-echelon supply chain network, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, under various conditions. The insights derived discern the effect of mitigation measures during a disruption, offering valuable guidance for decision makers.},

	abstract = {Background An image sharing framework is important to support downstream data analysis especially for pandemics like Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Current centralized image sharing frameworks become dysfunctional if any part of the framework fails. Existing decentralized image sharing frameworks do not store the images on the blockchain, thus the data themselves are not highly available, immutable, and provable. Meanwhile, storing images on the blockchain provides availability/immutability/provenance to the images, yet produces challenges such as large-image handling, high viewing latency while viewing images, and software inconsistency while storing/loading images. Objective This study aims to store chest x-ray images using a blockchain-based framework to handle large images, improve viewing latency, and enhance software consistency. Basic Procedures We developed a splitting and merging function to handle large images, a feature that allows previewing an image earlier to improve viewing latency, and a smart contract to enhance software consistency. We used 920 publicly available images to evaluate the storing and loading methods through time measurements. Main Findings The blockchain network successfully shares large images up to 18 MB and supports smart contracts to provide code immutability, availability, and provenance. Applying the preview feature successfully shared images 93\% faster than sharing images without the preview feature. Principal Conclusions The findings of this study can guide future studies to generalize our framework to other forms of data to improve sharing and interoperability.},

In this work, a blockchain-based smart solution is presented for demand-side management of residential buildings in a neighborhood to improve Peaks to Average Ratios (PAR) of power load, reduce energy consumption, and increase the thermal comfort of occupants by modeling heating, illumination, and appliance systems. For real-time power and temperature monitoring of the neighborhood, a transient numerical physical model has been developed. The simulator has been validated with data measured from a building in Northern Italy. Then, a neighborhood with 2,000 households has been modeled for different occupancy patterns, initial values, and boundary conditions. Two different control scenarios, namely basic and smart, have been considered. In the basic scenario, everything is managed by occupants except the boiler, which is controlled by the indoor temperature of the home. Instead, in the smart scenario, a blockchain-based network has been introduced for buildings to exchange a parameter called the Probability of the Next Hour (PNH). Ethereum Solidity has been deployed for smart contract development in the blockchain. The results show that using blockchain-connected smart controllers aimed at demand-side management can improve PAR, comfort level, and energy efficiency of buildings, which can bring about CO2 reduction on an urban and even global scale.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the blockchain-assisted frequency regulation mechanism for achieving resiliency and robustness in a renewable-based hybrid power system (HPS) powered by multiple sources, including wind turbine generators (WTG), hydrogen fuel cells (FC) with aqua electrolyzer (AE), diesel engine generators (DEG) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Frequency fluctuations are exacerbated by load uncertainties paired with energy-generating source uncertainties resulting from integrating multiple distributed energy resources (DERs) into the national electric power grid. In the event of energy generation loss, efficient load frequency control (LFC) techniques are considered essential for frequency restoration in DER-integrated HPS. In addition, active power regulation data in LFC need secure data storage mechanisms for ensuring cyber-resilience, a transparent cash payout mechanism for the stakeholders in LFC market operation, and related sustainability services. A novel resilient blockchain framework for realizing LFC is proposed for addressing the power resilience and the false-data injection issue. Moreover, a parameter sensitivity algorithm (PSA) constrained optimization methodology using the genetic algorithm (GA) withstands the energy generation loss and uncertainties. A consensus algorithm-based blockchain methodology acts as an enabler for strategic decision-making and secures the data flow to the market operator. The proposed framework-driven methodology is implemented using a Blockchain network developed in python for securing LFC transactions by developing a case study for HPS. Numerous simulation scenarios demonstrate the proposed methodology's effectiveness in establishing a synergistic operative framework for the resilient and robust operation of the hybrid energy system with multiple sources, even in the event of uncertainties.},

Thereby is the development of a holistic and data-continuous traceability system, which provides transparency of records for the entire manufacturing flow from raw materials to the final product, one of the main challenges. While some solutions already address traceability issues in supply chain management and manufacturing, customized and volatile industries, in which each product features a unique configuration, are still lacking appropriate models and proofs of concept. In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures. The proposed blockchain architecture is based on a consortium Ethereum network and a Proof of Authority consensus, which delivers a trusted and shared database within an economic processing framework. To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract. A user-friendly front-end application simplifies the querying of the recorded traceability data and visualizes existing dependencies.},

IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in many smart applications such as smart cities, healthcare, smart farms, industry etc. In recent few years, the greenhouse industry has earned significant consideration from the agriculture community due to its ability to produce fresh agricultural products with immense growth and production rate. However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40–50\% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator’s state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19\% against the prediction based approach and 41\% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform. For experimental analysis, we have conducted a series of experiments using Hyperledger calliper concerning throughput, latency, and resource utilization. These results advocates the efficiency of the proposed optimal greenhouse system.},

Because of the lack of reliable attack analysis systems, fully understanding some attacks on the blockchain, such as mining, network communication, smart contract, and privacy theft attacks, has remained challenging. Therefore, in this study, we examine the security and privacy of the blockchain and analyze possible solutions. We systematical classify the blockchain attack techniques into three categories, then discuss the corresponding attack and defense methods based on these categories. We focus on (1) the attack and defense methods of mining pool attacks for blockchain security issues, such as block withholding, 51\%, pool hopping, selfish mining, and fork after withholding attacks, in the attack type of consensus excitation; (2) the attack and defense methods of network communication and smart contracts for blockchain security issues, such as distributed denial-of-service, Sybil, eclipse, and reentrancy attacks, in the attack type of middle protocol; and (3) the attack and defense methods of privacy thefts for blockchain privacy issues, such as identity privacy and transaction information attacks, in the attack type of application service.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has been envisaged to commence an era of decentralised applications and services (DApps) without the need for a trusted intermediary. Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated, peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services’ performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback mechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the ecosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem by introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding light on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.},

Blockchain technology is being used in many applications majorly in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin applications. Verified transactions which make a block and group of such transactions or blocks are immutable making the blockchain more secured and reliable. Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91\% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client.},

	abstract = {Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone \& McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system. The study discovered a significant influence of information quality and user satisfaction. On the contrary, system quality seems to have an almost significant influence on the use and user satisfaction of the proposed system.},

	abstract = {Background Blockchain distributed ledger technology is just starting to be adopted in genomics and healthcare applications. Despite its increased prevalence in biomedical research applications, skepticism regarding the practicality of blockchain technology for real-world problems is still strong and there are few implementations beyond proof-of-concept. We focus on benchmarking blockchain strategies applied to distributed methods for sharing records of gene-drug interactions. We expect this type of sharing will expedite personalized medicine. Basic Procedures We generated gene-drug interaction test datasets using the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) resource. We developed three blockchain-based methods to share patient records on gene-drug interactions: Query Index, Index Everything, and Dual-Scenario Indexing. Main Findings We achieved a runtime of about 60 s for importing 4,000 gene-drug interaction records from four sites, and about 0.5 s for a data retrieval query. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible to leverage blockchain as a new platform to share data among institutions. Principal Conclusions We show the benchmarking results of novel blockchain-based methods for institutions to share patient outcomes related to gene-drug interactions. Our findings support blockchain utilization in healthcare, genomic and biomedical applications. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/tsungtingkuo/genedrug.},

	abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.},

	abstract = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security.},

Using blockchain technology (BT) network system for optimization, a smart contract is used to build a risk management system of NPO, so that public opinion can be traced through the smart ledger using risk association tree technology. First, BT, NPO, and related theories of risk management are introduced. Second, the network situation of public opinion dissemination in the blockchain environment is discussed. Finally, a BT-based risk management model of the NPO is implemented, and experiments are conducted to verify the effect of the model. Furthermore, the theoretical framework of NPO credibility model detection is optimized according to the public opinion risk prediction model. The research results reveal that the three experimental schemes reached the peak density of the number of public opinion disseminators in the third step, and the highest values were 0.1335, 0.1318, and 0.1296, respectively. Moreover, the density of public opinion dissemination in the three experimental schemes reached a stable state of 0.087, 0.088, and 0.0898, respectively after 48 steps. Under BT, the designed three experimental schemes can reasonably conduct the risk prediction and credibility detection of NPO. This work contributes to optimizing the control measures of the network environment.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the digital world, digital rights management (DRM) becomes increasingly important. Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (MA-ABE) schemes provide suitable solutions for flexible fine-grained access control in DRM. However, there are two accountable problems unsolved when applying existing ABE schemes to DRM directly: illegal authorization and key disclosure. Illegal authorization means that some attribute authorities might collude with users and issue attribute keys to unauthorized users illegally. Key disclosure denotes that some users might maliciously expose their attribute keys to the public. Both the above problems could lead to unauthorized users accessing digital content, which is extremely harmful to DRM. To solve these problems, we design a novel MA-ABE scheme based on blockchain. Our scheme ensures that a relevant user could obtain the final decryption attribute key only after all attribute authorities have issued their keys to the blockchain publicly. If a malicious attribute authority issues attribute keys to inappropriate users, the auditor defined in our scheme would detect the malicious behavior. Meanwhile, once some users publish their decryption keys to the public, the auditor is able to transparently trace such users utilizing an incentive mechanism. In addition, we design and implement two smart contracts on Ethereum, called RecordContract and TraceContract, which are used to record users’ encrypted attribute keys and encourage participants to trace the owner of disclosed decryption attribute key, respectively. Finally, the security proof and efficiency simulation show that the proposed scheme can be securely and efficiently applied to DRM.},

Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance.

Most of the existing authentication mechanisms depend on a central trusted third party to manage large numbers of certificates or pseudonyms, to conduct the time-consuming database query operations in order to achieve both security and privacy protection for IoV. The huge computation, storage and network bandwidth burden on the central trusted entity affects greatly the performance of the authentication and also leaves potential perils for the whole system. In this paper, we suggest a new authentication scheme for IoV. Distributed authentication is achieved by using blockchain technique, in which large numbers of certificates, public-private key pairs or pseudonyms do not need to be stored in vehicles or central trusted entity.

The dialectical method of research in conjunction with a retrospective and comparative analysis made it possible to identify three main trends in the legal regulation of entrepreneurial activity in the framework of new socio-economic realities. The increasing role of state regulation of entrepreneurial activity, based on the use of public and legal means, due to the need to increase state intervention in the activities of entrepreneurs is shown. The state support of business for the subsequent development of the economy and compliance with the social balance is also increasing. Accordingly, the social importance of entrepreneurial activity is growing. The pandemic has also intensified the digitalization of entrepreneurial activity, of transport companies, since many traditional forms of doing business are limited by the forced isolation of society. Individual means of digitalization, including the industrial Internet of Things, e-commerce, and smart contracts, have become most prevalent. Consequently, the pandemic cannot be viewed only as a negative factor, its impact on entrepreneurial activity also has a positive effect.},

OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.},

The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9\%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.},

	abstract = {Immunization has become essential for prevention of infectious diseases during pandemic situations across the globe, and unsafe vaccines are seriously affecting public health and economy of countries. However, issues such as falsified or substandard and expired vaccines are still exist due to complex global supply chains and the fact that present vaccine management systems are under the control of different entities in the vaccine supply chain. Therefore, the requirement to develop the Cyber Physical ecosystem that is more resilient, responsive and having smart track and trace is urgently required. To achieve these objectives, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) based vaccine supply chain is proposed in this work. The proposed system takes advantages of blockchain database to store the generated data through interactions among stakeholders and from IoT devices in vaccine supply chain. The proposed system is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain framework through which the proposed system achieves resiliency, track and trace of vaccine circulation. The performance evaluations are obtained by testing a HLF with smart contracts. The evaluation is further driven by clients via Hyperledger Caliper, which is a bench mark tool used to measure the performance of blockchain solutions developed on Hyperledger. The results exhibit that the proposed system outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of throughput and latency etc.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing framework for multiple requesters with multiple workers built on Ethereum blockchain- SenseChain. Crowdsensing frameworks utilize workers’ sensing capabilities to fulfill requesters’ sensing tasks. While crowdsensing is typically managed by a centralized platform, the centralized management entails various challenges such as reliability in workers’ selection, fair evaluation for payment distribution, potential breach of users’ privacy, and high deployment cost. The proposed solution, SenseChain, is a decentralized crowdsensing framework developed to run on Ethereum blockchain to mitigate said challenges while increasing users’ engagement, with reasonable cost. SenseChain is developed around three smart contracts: (1) User Manager Contract (UMC), (2) Task Manager Contract (TMC), and (3) Task Detailed Contract (TDC). These contracts implement the platform features such as maintaining users’ information, publishing tasks from multiple requesters, accepting reservations and solutions from multiple workers, and evaluating solutions to calculate proportional payments. The framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The framework performance is compared to a centralized greedy selection framework to demonstrate its comparability while mitigating tackled challenges. The results in terms of solutions quality, time cost, and workers traveled distance confirm its viability as a solution for crowdsensing.},

Although blockchain is considered a potential solution for these concerns, the pension industry has not fully leveraged this disruptive technology. This paper provides a blueprint for a blockchain-based end-to-end digital transformation of the pension industry. First, we identified the pre-requisites for blockchain adoption in pension. Then, we developed an architectural design of blockchain-based re-designed pension business processes. Subsequently, we elaborated on how smart contracts can make pension transactions in such redesigned processes optimized, automated, and error-free. Finally, we presented how blockchain can be integrated with the existing pension IT systems, using an API layer, to enable seamless onboarding of all pension participants to a single digital platform – a critical ask for any blockchain implementation. We concluded with an elucidation of the potential of such blockchain-based digital transformation of the pension industry in reducing turnaround time, lowering operating expenses, and facilitating the achievement of other pension reform agendas. This architecture of a blockchain-enabled pension network represents a flexible and scalable knowledge construct that can act as a foundation for further investigations by pension regulators or pension industry participants interested in achieving technology-driven pension operations reforms.},

	abstract = {In a recent survey of academic research, Fintech related topics, broadly classified as crypto-currency studies, were by far the most researched topics in the social sciences. However, we have observed that, perhaps surprisingly, even though crypto-currencies rely on a distributed accounting ledger technology, relatively few of those studies were conducted by accounting academics. While some of the features of a system like Bitcoin do not necessarily rely on a traditional accounting knowledge, this knowledge is key in designing effective real-world distributed systems. Building on a foundational framework developed by Risius and Spohrer (2017), we provide support for their hypothesis that to date, research in this area has been predominantly of a somewhat narrow focus (i.e., based upon exploiting existing programming solutions without adequately considering the fundamental needs of users). This is particularly reflected by the abundance of Bitcoin-like crypto-currency code-bases with little or no place for business applications. We suggest that this may severely limit an appreciation of the relevance and applicability of decentralized systems, and how they may support value creation and improved governance. We provide supporting arguments for this statement by considering four applied classes of problems where a blockchain/distributed ledger can add value without requiring a crypto-currency to be an integral part of the functioning system. We note that each class of problem has been viewed previously as part of accounting issues within the legacy centralized ledger systems paradigm. We show how accounting knowledge is still relevant in the shift from centralized to decentralized ledger systems. We advance the debate on the development of (crypto-currency free) value-creating distributed ledger systems by showing that applying accounting knowledge in this area has potentially a much wider impact than that currently being applied in areas limited to auditing and operations management. We develop a typology for general distributed ledger design which assists potential users to understand the wide range of choices when developing such systems.},

Due to the over dependence of the Third Party Auditor (TPA) and the dynamical nature of the IoT data, the traditional data integrity verification framework for cloud storage can hardly work. To satisfy the characteristics of the IoT and avoid the over dependence of the TPA, we propose a blockchain-based framework without TPA for data integrity verification in a decentralized edge-cloud storage (ECS) scenario in this paper. In our framework, we employ the Merkle tree with random challenging numbers for data integrity verification and analyze different Merkle tree structures to optimize the system performance. To solve the problem of limited resources and high real-time requirements, we further propose sampling verification and develop rational sampling strategies to make sampling verification more effective. The overhead and precision of the verification in ECS are studied by an optimal sample size strategy. Finally, a prototype system is implemented based on our framework. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The experimental results show that our schemes can effectively improve the performance of data integrity verification.},

However, it constitutes a complex challenge because malicious entities can tamper with fuel dispensers to get undue economic advantages. This paper proposes a distributed and decentralized solution. We use IoT-based vehicle simple meters to estimate the fuel amount in refilling events. Although these estimates can be inaccurate, we explore properties of the Law of the Large Numbers to evaluate the fuel dispenser's accuracy. We also use blockchains to avoid collusion attacks and provide a truly distributed and decentralized surveillance solution that implements statistical surveillance analysis as smart contracts. We develop a case study based on the vehicular fleet and fuel dispensers in São Paulo, Brazil. We perform our experiment using the Hyperledger Fabric platform with Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus. In a hypothetical scenario where vehicular meters present error rates below 5\%, and each vehicle refuels more than ten times on average, we can identify tampered fuel dispensers with sensitivity and specificity over 95\%. We also demonstrate that our blockchain deployment can support a workload of 600 concurrent clients with a throughput higher than 350 tps and latency lower than 1 s. These results attest to our framework suitability in terms of accuracy and performance.

In the collaborative emergency response, it is important to support various responders with a unified platform to assist in decision-making, distribution of resources, and coordination of emergency operation. In recent years, blockchain has provided strong support for the innovation of emergency management mechanisms with its technical advantages such as distributed storage, decentralization, consensus algorithms, tamper-proof, traceability, and smart contract. This study firstly reviews the development of blockchain and its application in emergency management. Secondly, the connotation and key dilemmas of the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism are expounded from two aspects of the multi-agent participation and the construction of a collaborative mechanism. Then, the possibility of using blockchain to facilitate the innovation of multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism is analyzed from the aspects of emergency management information sharing, resource storage and distribution, the rights and obligations of multiple subjects, supervision, reward and punishment. Finally, a conceptual model of a multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism based on alliance chain and public chain is proposed. The application of blockchain provides a new perspective and motivation for the innovation of emergency management system. This study provides a new method for improving the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism, and is an important supplement and innovation to existing emergency management studies.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid development of cloud computing for many years, data security and trusted computing are still the main challenges in current cloud computing applications. In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter’s secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a “block-and-response” mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme.},

	abstract = {Cold chains are effective in maintaining food quality and reducing food losses, especially for long-distance international food commerce. Several recent reports have demonstrated that frozen foods are serving as carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus from one place to another without any human-to-human contact. This finding highlights significant difficulties facing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and reveal a transmission mechanism that may have substantially worsened the global pandemic. Traditional food cold chain management practices do not include specific procedures related to SARS-CoV-2-related environmental control and information warnings; therefore, such procedures are urgently needed to allow food to be safely transported without transmitting SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a conjoint analysis of COVID-19 and food cold chain systems was performed, and the results of this analysis were used to develop an improved food cold chain management system utilizing internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. First, 45 COVID-19-related food cold chain incidents in China, primarily involving frozen meat and frozen aquatic products, were summarized. Critical food cold chain control points related to COVID-19 were analyzed, including temperature and cold chain requirements. A conceptual system structure to improve food cold chain management, including information sensing, chain linking and credible tracing, was proposed. Finally, a prototype system, which consisted of cold chain environment monitoring equipment, a cold chain blockchain platform, and a food chain management system, was developed. The system includes: 1) a defining characteristic of the newly developed food cold chain system presented here is the use of IoT technology to enhance real-time environmental information sensing capacity; 2) a hybrid data storage mechanism consisting of off-chain and on-chain systems was applied to enhance data security, and smart contracts were used to establish warning levels for food cold chain incidents; and 3) a hypothetical food cold chain failure scenario demonstration in which information collection, intelligent decision making, and cold chain tracing were integrated and automatically generated for decision-making. By integrating existing technologies and approaches, our study provides a novel solution to improve traditional food cold chain management and thus meet the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our system has been shown to be effective, subsequent studies are still required to develop precise risk evaluation models for SARs-CoV-2 in food cold chains and more precisely control the entire process. By ensuring food safety and reliable traceability, our system could also contribute to the formulation of appropriate mechanisms for international cooperation and minimize the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international food commerce.},

	abstract = {There are several distributed ledger protocols potentially suitable for the Internet of things (IoT), including the Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and IOTA. This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic –the smart contracts– and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.},

The features of distributed ledgers and smart contract auto-execution possessed by blockchain technology are in line with the requirements of distributed energy resources in billing and settlement, which provides a direction for the application of blockchain technology in the distributed energy resources. The integration of distributed energy resources in China with blockchain technology may break the existing pattern where the production, transportation, distribution and sales of energy are centralized. This paper first summarizes the current status of distributed energy resources in China and blockchain technology, and then uses the Michael Porter five forces model to analyze the competitiveness of distributed energy resources. The rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of alternatives, bargaining power of suppliers, and bargaining power of buyers in energy industry are presented and analyzed. Based on the competitiveness analysis, the SWOT model is used to analyze the joint development model of “blockchain technology + distributed energy resources”, and the feasibility of blockchain technology applied to distributed energy resources systems is revealed.

	abstract = {Industrial applications often require federated cloud services from multiple providers to improve reliability and flexibility. Traditional selection methods through auctions usually involve a centralized auctioneer to coordinate the auction procedure. Blockchain and smart contracts provide a decentralized mechanism to automate the cloud auction process; however, existing solutions fail in the selection of the most suitable providers and the violation detection of the signed auction agreements, which are also known as service-level agreements (SLAs). To tackle these problems, we propose an integrated auction model using Bayesian game theory and blockchain techniques. The proposed model is enhanced with two Bayesian Nash Equilibriums (BNEs); the first BNE enables the selection of cost-effective providers to construct the federated cloud services, while the second BNE ensures consistent and trustworthy monitoring of federated SLAs. Moreover, a timed message submission (TMS) algorithm is proposed to protect the auction privacy during the message submission phase. This paper validates the equilibrium results of two BNEs and implements the proposed model on the Ethereum blockchain. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness of our model.},

	abstract = {Services computing can offer a high-level abstraction to support diverse applications via encapsulating various computing infrastructures. Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS.},

	abstract = {Context: Process views support the paradigm of Business Process Outsourcing, in which providers perform business processes on behalf of their clients. A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views. Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent. Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture. Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration. Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.},

As the market players, prosumers in the local distribution network are considered in two groups, producers (sellers) and consumers (buyers). Using smart contracts, all sellers and buyers in the proposed market can engage in bilateral energy token transactions (P2P) with each other under an agreed price and with the retail market at a certain price. Furthermore, the local consumers can participate in price-based DR programs and shift their consuming load to the periods with high local generation. Demurrage mechanism is applied to avoid energy token accumulation and enhance attraction for local transactions. With demurrage in place, the redemption value of energy-backed tokens reduces with time. A fully decentralized approach called the primal-dual sub-gradient method is developed to clear this fully decentralized energy market in the presence of DR programs and demurrage. The proposed market-clearing scheme guarantees the global and feasible solution without requiring the players' private information. Numerical studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy token market and the decentralized approach for its clearing.},

	abstract = {Large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources brings new challenges for smart grid management requiring the development of decentralized solutions and active participation of prosumer and non-grid-owned assets. Local energy flexibility markets can help in monitoring energy flows, motivate changes in prosumers’ energy supply and demand, achieving local energy balance, and optimization of electricity flows. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized energy flexibility market enabling small-scale prosumers to trade in a peer-to-peer fashion their flexibility in terms of load modulation concerning the baseline energy profiles. We have defined an energy flexibility token for digitizing the flexibility of prosumers allowing to be traded on the market as an asset and self-enforcing smart contracts for decentralized market operation including functions such as the placement of flexibility bids/offers, trading session management, or energy and financial settlement of energy flexibility transactions. For matching the flexibility bids and offers, a solution based on a greedy heuristic and a bipartite graph is proposed for minimizing the number of flexibility transactions and reducing the blockchain-associated costs, while Oracles are used to assure its secure integration with the blockchain. The blockchain-based flexibility market was validated with the help of the Terni city Distribution System Operator, showing promising results in enabling the self-consumption of renewable energy generated in a small scale urban micro-grid considering live energy monitoring data, and in assuring the local balancing of the demand side in a simulated environment considering many market participants and historical energy data.},

Consequently, there is need to create a platform to enable charging point operators to effectively manage the EV user’s charging requests and ensure that there charging needs are satisfied while not exceeding the distribution grid capacity. If this is not done, there is no doubt that in few a years, EV owners will be faced with the problems of unavailability of charging stations and congestion in grid sequel to simultaneous charging of many EV’s. This work proposes a smart EV charging infrastructure based on a blockchain platform. With the charging demand (kWh) and maximum duration of the charging event provided by the EV user, the EV load flexibility is determined and utilized through smart charging to achieve a stable grid. EV owners and charging stations are linked through the platform thereby reducing the actors in EV charging ecosystem from six to four. Flexibility (power and time) in charging of EV is traded within the blockchain platform. By this, additional investors will be attracted into the business of EV charging station and through flexible offers, EV loads are shifted from the peak load hours. Consequently, the simulations shows that the acceptance rate of EV users increased by more than 50\% when our smart charging system was adopted compared to the normal charging scenario.},

	abstract = {The cloud computing technology has emerged, developed, and matured in recent years, consequently commercializing remote outsourcing storage services. An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved. Finally, we implement the protocols, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.},

	abstract = {The large integration of variable renewable energy sources brings new challenges to system operations due to their volatile nature. In this context, demand response programs appear as an important alternative to match the instantaneous supply and demand of energy by changing the electric use of end-users. The traditional load control schemes of demand response are the direct and indirect control. While the direct schemes assure coordination and fail in scalability, the indirect schemes assure scalability, but they could fail in coordination. To face some of the challenges, this paper defines a framework and mathematical formulation for the interactions between a demand aggregator and its end-users, based on flexibility bands. It allows the aggregator to communicate and control a higher number of end-users at the same time that the end-users can make local decisions regarding their consumption. The flexibility band is a control signal, composed of an upper and a lower consumption bound, so that end consumers can consume electricity in the way they want as long as they stay within these bounds. The band features can be linked to contractual arrangements allowing the creation of new products for electricity markets. The simulations consider an aggregator interacting with 10000 end-users. The end-users present different types of flexible loads, such as thermal, deferrable, and non-interruptible loads. The results indicate that this scheme is capable of achieving scalability and coordination, and it has the potential to provide new services such as adjusting the flexibility bands after the first response from end-users.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger technology which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications to address lack-of-trust issues in business. Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of management a residential storage system with distributed generation. With the introduction of a hybrid AC/DC inverter in this system, efficient energy management is realized to achieve the minimization of the cost of the energy balance among purchasing, renewable generation, curtailment and reserve capacity. This cost reduction is achieved by either meeting the load or selling surplus energy, and dispensing a residential demand load controller. To address the dynamic problem and with uncertainties regarding the load, renewable energy, and energy purchase and sale tariffs, a mixed integer linear programming model was developed with adjustable robust programming (ADJ-ROBUST-MILP), and it also involves technical restrictions and criteria for increasing the life cycle of the storage system. The dynamic aspect imparts practical applicability via the permanent correction of the ADJ-ROBUST-MILP solution with a heuristic that acts proactively in the developed dynamics by observing prior conditions. The case studies demonstrate that the mathematical heuristic is able to confer benefit to the energy scheduling of smart home energy management while presenting computational complexity capable of being used in real systems, which is exemplified herein.},

Smart cities can offer finest services for boosting the daily life of citizens on healthcare, transportation, energy consumption, and education. However, the concept of smart city is still evolving and despite its potential vision, there are proliferating security challenges. Blockchain has the potential to promote the development of smart cities owing to its good properties such as auditability, transparency, immutability and decentralization. Therefore, this paper presents the state-of-the-art blockchain technology to solve the security issues of smart cities. Initially, the paper throws light on the background knowledge and then surveys the utility of blockchain in various smart communities such as healthcare, transportation, smart grid, supply chain management, financial systems and data center networks. Finally, some future research directions are identified through extensive literature survey on blockchain based smart city systems.},

	abstract = {Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96\% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18\% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85\% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.},

Taking into account the predicted evolution of the IoT in the coming years, it is necessary to provide confidence in this huge incoming information source. Blockchain has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which we share information. Building trust in distributed environments without the need for authorities is a technological advance that has the potential to change many industries, the IoT among them. Disruptive technologies such as big data and cloud computing have been leveraged by IoT to overcome its limitations since its conception, and we think blockchain will be one of the next ones.

	abstract = {VANETS (IoVs), banks, and healthcare records are the sensitive information of vehicles, clients, and patients that is stored and maintained electronically, which has historically been a popular target for privacy leakage. To address growing issues about privacy leakage in these scenarios, federated learning has been frequently accepted as a privacy-preserving framework that enables multiple users to collectively develop a global model. To preserve the privacy of the training data, the server and participants share only model parameters. However, since participants have access to modified model parameters, this solution is still prone to poisoning and label-flipping attacks. Recent research showed that the federated learning framework is highly susceptible to attacks, with poisoning and label flipping being the most powerful, as well as secluded attacks, in which attackers can poison the parameters of the global model to gain access to the clients’ confidential information or degrade the global model’s performance. To address these attacks, a decentralized framework for securing the global models in federated learning (SecurePrivChain) is proposed in this study. A permissioned private Ethereum blockchain and encryption mechanisms were adopted in the framework to hide global parameters and preserve the privacy of a client’s data as well as achieve client’s authentication. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated using metrics such as computed cost, transaction latency, loss, and cost analysis based on Ethereum gas consumption. The performance of the scheme was compared with other benchmark models which are based on different encryption mechanisms. These included RSA and algamal using publicly available MNIST, banks, vehicles, and hospital datasets. Numerical results show that the proposed framework has good performance. A formal security analysis is done to show how the system can meet its goal of protecting privacy.},

	abstract = {With the aid of advancing technologies, the healthcare sector is improving more swiftly than ever, yet there are still many unexplored areas and there is always potential for improvement. Deep Learning (DL), blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), three of the most revolutionary technologies, have aided replace conventional practice employed in the healthcare industry with more sophisticated and efficient procedures. In this research, we propose DON-B-STRESSED (DBS), an innovative framework which integrates DL, blockchain and IoMT technologies to provide a method for the early detection of stress in users donning IoMT devices. Long-term stress, indeed, is well-known to have profound consequences on human wellbeing; hence the need for automated solutions for continual stress monitoring. DON-B-STRESSED stands for DON a Blockchain-based, Secure, Timely, REliable System for StrEss Detection: the premise behind this is that if the above-mentioned technologies can be combined, a system that employs IoMT for users' data collection, DL to properly predict patients' stress levels, and smart contracts deployed on blockchain to ensure secure transactions and health checks, the well-known concerns of harmful effects of long-term stress might be avoided. By using multimodal data from both a chest- and a wrist-worn IoMT device, we have developed a tailored, secure, accurate yet fast real-time system for the early detection of stress signs. The DL part has been evaluated on WESAD, a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, reaching an accuracy of more than 99\% with LOSO generalization scheme. Furthermore, the scalability and reliability of DON-B-STRESSED are shown by comparison with the findings of past research.},

	abstract = {This conceptual article seeks to integrate blockchain into current theory on the governance of inter-organizational exchanges within business networks. It posits that a blockchain governance structure comprised of administrative, platform, and application level mechanisms represents a significant new antecedent and causal factor determining the extent of the need for the traditional contractual and relational mechanisms of governance. Further, that blockchain delivered governance can perform the functions of transaction coordination and safeguarding which are required in order to substitute for those traditional mechanisms of governance. A discussion points the way towards empirical verification of the framework created, and towards avenues for further theoretical research, and examines the implications of blockchain delivered governance for practitioners. In developing this framework, this article also seeks to make a contribution by placing attention on the need for the building of theory applying to blockchain, and for quantitative measurement of the effects of blockchain on organizations and business networks. This article concludes that the emergence of blockchain technology now provides the means by which automation of the specification, validation, and enforcement of private ordering between exchange participants can be achieved, and that this should stimulate a reevaluation of existing theories of inter-organizational governance.},

However, current approaches cannot efficiently reduce road travel, making it challenging to decarbonize in the transport sector. Therefore, in this paper, we propose STRICTs, a blockchain-enabled motor vehicle restrictive and trading system based on the carbon emissions cap. STRICTs allows automated carbon emission auditing and carbon emission violation punishment without relying on third-party escrow. Through a decentralized enforcer, STRICTs also enables carbon permit trading reliably and transparently.

	abstract = {Objective The creation and exchange of patients’ Electronic Healthcare Records have developed significantly in the last decade. Patients’ records are however distributed in data silos across multiple healthcare facilities, posing technical and clinical challenges that may endanger patients’ safety. Current healthcare sharing systems ensure interoperability of patients’ records across facilities, but they have limits in presenting doctors with the clinical context of the data in the records. We design and implement a platform for managing provenance tracking of Electronic Healthcare Records based on blockchain technology, compliant with the latest healthcare standards and following the patient-informed consent preferences. Methods The platform leverages two pillars: the use of international standards such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), Health Level Seven International (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to achieve interoperability, and the use of a provenance creation process that by-design, avoids personal data storage within the blockchain. The platform consists of: (1) a smart contract implemented within the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain that manages provenance according to the W3C PROV for medical document in standardised formats (e.g. a CDA document, a FHIR resource, a DICOM study, etc.); (2) a Java Proxy that intercepts all the document submissions and retrievals for which provenance shall be evaluated; (3) a service used to retrieve the PROV document. Results We integrated our decentralised platform with the SpiritEHR engine, an enterprise-grade healthcare system, and we stored and retrieved the available documents in the Mandel's sample CDA repository,11See https://github.com/jmandel/sample\_ccdas. which contained no protected health information. Using a cloud-based blockchain solution, we observed that the overhead added to the typical processing time of reading and writing medical data is in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, the integration of the Proxy at the level of exchanged messages in EHR systems allows transparent usage of provenance data in multiple health computing domains such as decision making, data reconciliation, and patient consent auditing. Conclusions By using international healthcare standards and a cloud-based blockchain deployment, we delivered a solution that can manage provenance of patients’ records via transparent integration within the routine operations on healthcare data.},

However, the security and trust of traditional centralized system is insufficient and data tampering is easy to occur, which leads to data distrustful. The characteristics of blockchain, such as traceable and tamper-proof, can solve the issue of data trust. However, the access threshold of the blockchain is high. In order to reduce the technical difficulty, in this article, a universal BaaS platform (called TrustedBaaS) which has high flexibility and scalability was designed based on consortium blockchain, it can support user-defined configuration according to requirements of users. Afterwards we described the process of executing a transaction in detail and discussed the core protocols and algorithms of the BaaS platform, which includes identity authentication, consensus algorithm, data protection protocol, smart contract and on-blockchain and off-blockchain data collaboration. Furthermore, we implemented TrustedBaaS based on Hyperledger Fabric and a vehicular information management application platform and a transaction settlement application platform were configured based on TrustedBaaS. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the TrustedBaaS and compared it with current public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The evaluation showed that the designed TrustedBaaS has better performance than the existing public blockchain platforms. Moreover, it is common distributed higher-level trusted platform which provides configurable and extensible functions and solves the problem that the access threshold of blockchain technology is high.},

World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that nearly 1035\% of the drugs, i.e., one out of ten medicines produced in the least developing countries, are counterfeit and have serious side effects on human lives. The upsurge in online and Internet-based pharmacies has made the safety and security of the drug supply chain process more intricate and complicated. This research proposes a new and novel track and trace blockchain-enabled Medledger system that leverages the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using chaincodes (smart contracts). The proposed Medledger system helps to efficiently and securely execute drug supply chain transactions in a fabric enabled private permissioned distributed network of different pharmaceutical stakeholders. Our proposed traceability solution diminishes the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transaction records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security that reduces the likelihood of meddling with stored data on the Medledger. Chaincodes are designed, coded, and implemented using sequence diagrams to govern and control the interaction amongst the participating stakeholders in the drug supply chain ecosystem. The proposed system perpetually stores and records all activities, events, and transactions on the blockchain's immutable Medledger linked with peer-to-peer decentralized file systems such as IPFS, Swarm, filecoin, etc. for storing and providing maximum transparency and traceability. We provide an insight into some of the ongoing implementation challenges for the hyperledger fabric platform. Finally, we discuss open challenges that serve as future research directions to improve the drug traceability solutions further.},

	abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in today’s Internet introduced huge demand for End-to-End Quality of Service (E2E QoS) assurances for delivering different types of traffic (video, live streaming, and telemedicine), originating from a wide spectrum of applications. Such applications stretch across multiple administrative domains and require fair and robust coordination for E2E QoS provisioning. While the selection of trusted domains is of paramount importance for the successful realization of E2E QoS, the issue of domain’s trust while finding E2E QoS paths has not been actively explored in the existing works. Trust awareness reduces the risk of violating QoS and improves the confidence of operating QoS across multiple domains. However, identifying trusted domains, finding the source of trust, and quantifying trust are the major challenges for enabling trust aware E2E QoS routing. Auditability of QoS implementation results at each domain forms a vital source for verifying QoS compliance and subsequently evaluating the trust of the domain. However, securely obtaining logs from the domains and identifying the accountability of domains for E2E QoS, without relying on a third party introduces significant difficulty when evaluating domain trust with respect to QoS compliance. This work proposes Trust aware E2E QoS Routing (TRAQR) framework for provisioning E2E QoS with trust and verifying the QoS compliance in Multi-Domain Software Defined Networks (MD-SDN). TRAQR efficiently leverages the tamper-proof and decentralized properties of Blockchain to store and exchange different kinds of trust information required to provision and verify E2E QoS compliance of the domains. This work developed a proof of concept implementation of the TRAQR in an MD-SDN environment emulated using Mininet, RYU SDN controller, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to demonstrate the performance and benefits of TRAQR. Further, the simulations showed that the domain trust parameter introduced significant improvement in QoS compliance, even in the presence of untrusted domains.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the published work on how blockchain technology will impact accounting in general, but AI-enabled auditing specifically. The purpose is to investigate how blockchain technology can improve transparency and trust in accounting practice and how professionals can use blockchain data to improve decision-making, based on the qualities of immutability, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) blockchain data. The multi-party validation of blockchain protocols adds real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efficiency. This review summarizes four themes emerging from the literature focusing on how blockchain technology has changed record-keeping in accounting: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry-accounting and continuous auditing. The research interprets the findings using agency theory and stakeholder theory to advance how using blockchain to mitigate information asymmetry and improve stakeholder collaborations is understood. The investigation also summarizes the challenges and clarifies organizations’ reasons to be cautious about adopting blockchain. Lastly, the study suggests that future researchers use this study in two ways that enrich blockchain literature: first, to apply the themes and answer the questions identified within this review to improve the business methods of practitioners and policymakers; and second, to encourage stakeholders such as practitioners, system designers/developers, and policymakers to collaborate in designing blockchain ecosystems that suit accounting and auditing as they transform digitally.},

In this paper, we illustrate the use of these technologies for the implementation and deployment of a practical use case in the white appliances industry. Specifically, we present how a sorter component can be automatically programmed in order to ensure that items arriving at a conveyor are optimally placed in various bays. The use case leverages the edge computing paradigm in order to ensure that each physical item is able to communicate its status to all the others. At the same time, distributed ledger technologies enable the modelling of the sorting process as a reliable smart contract among all physical entities. The benefits of the deployment include tangible improvements in productivity, along with a significant reduction in the effort and time needed for the reconfiguration of the sorter.},

This paper thoroughly explores and analyzes state-of-the-art literature surveys on RS to extract important challenges and open issues. Our goal in this paper is to survey the literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC), focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a rich set of pointers to future research directions.},

While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: “You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical” reveals that this is a futile exercise. Algorithms are also pivotal to the current mania for Crypto-Algorithmic Blockchain Technology Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with a ‘Crypto Tribe’ of Millennials relentlessly raising billions in real money thereby, to the extent that I have dubbed Crypto the Millennials’ Rock'n’Roll. The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious – and there is already ICO litigation on foot. Nevertheless, taking my limerick-writing Castell GhostWriteBot’s advice, it is perhaps time for my own asset-linked ICO, to launch my CapChere.com concept designed to reboot Capitalism and achieve ubiquitous universal share and wealth ownership.

However, there are some issues still waiting to be solved, e.g. privacy of energy data, asynchrony of households’ desire and incomplete understanding of its operation features, etc. These issues may hinder its further application and development. To address these requirements, a research to analyze the characteristics of a typical peer-to-peer energy sharing community model is carried out. The model is built on the basis of the proof of credit consensus in blockchain technology and Shapley value in game theory. A two-level hierarchical incentive mechanism is proposed to motivate participants to obey the energy smart contract and involve in electricity peak-shifting. A series of indexes are applied to evaluate the operation performance of the proposed model, from the aspects of the economy, technique, environment and market efficiency. The validity of the incentive mechanism and the proposed model are verified, and the impacts of important factors, i.e. community scale and prosumer ratio, on the proposed model are assessed. This work would provide reference to the constructors of future peer-to-peer energy market about arranging the optimal appliance scale and distributed energy resources ratio to make it become more friendly, efficient and economical.},

	abstract = {Intuitive context-aware algorithms called "Next Basket recommender systems" improve consumers' decision-making by offering suggestions for potential products they might like to buy next based on their past behaviour. Even though it is now well-known, this field is still young. Many different industries, such as e-commerce and healthcare, employ recommender systems. Even though these datasets frequently contain sensitive data, most recommender systems place a greater emphasis on the models' accuracy than on their security and privacy. We investigate this concept in the context of the sequential recommendation job known as Next Basket Recommendation (NBR), whose objective is to provide a user with a selection of goods based on their purchasing behaviour. A recent state-of-the-art technology is blockchain. Blockchain creates a trusted environment without the involvement of a third party, thus ensuring privacy and security. It is designed in such a way that it is enough in itself to create trust. In this paper, we propose and assimilate an authentic blockchain privacy system for a fortified user recommendation system for the Next Basket Recommendation. With next basket proposals based on blockchain for safe transactions and distributed context-based processing, this suggested system enables the development of decentralized RSs. Through the use of atomic swaps on the blockchain, this effort aims to provide viable solutions that can lead to fair procedures. It places a focus on effective data deletion procedures that preserve user privacy and transfers the issue of decremental learning to the Next Basket system, a more secure and wise recommendation. By incorporating blockchain into recommender systems (RSs), which contain smart contracts in the main blockchain-based RS protocol, it is feasible to create safe trust-based systems with the benefit of multi-party computation backed by blockchain. Additionally, it aids in protecting user information since blockchain enables the secure processing of customer data in online portals.},

This is one of the first studies of blockchain adoption in the Greek shipping industry, which has not so far been examined by the literature, in direct comparison to early adopters in other European countries such as Norway. The research examined eight Greek shipping companies using workshops with experienced supply chain personnel. Qualitative analysis identified the current position of these organisations in terms of blockchain adoption, by considering possible benefits and inhibitors to implementation. Despite benefits of automated processes and reduced paperwork as a result of smart contracts, findings show a reluctance to adopt BCT. That is, enterprise resource planning (ERP) transformations have left organisations fatigued and disinclined towards further systems development and resistant to subsequent change. Also, the exposure of shared information in the shipping nexus is considered to cause a threat to competitive survival.},

We propose establishing a national hybrid blockchain-based platform that brings together all possible stakeholders in the field of higher education, including students, universities, government agencies, policymakers, and companies from the business sector. This study evaluates the costs and benefits from establishing this platform and investigates the possible commercialization of its contracts. Furthermore, we test the feasibility of this platform in two of the most instable low-income countries: Syria and Sudan. We find that this platform is feasible and can serve as a marketplace for all stakeholders in the higher education system and would increase the internationalization of higher education. The establishment of this platform will ensure inclusive and equitable education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for students from low-income countries and thus meets the fourth goal of Sustainable Development.},

	abstract = {With the development of the Energy Internet and the support of the subsidy policies of various countries, Electric Vehicles(EVs) have ushered in a golden development period. However, the development of EVs needs to solve the problems of insufficient charging piles(CPs) and difficulty in finding CPs. In order to solve the problem of difficult charging of EVs, the concept of shared charging came into being, in which idle CPs or private CPs are shared to meet the charging needs of more people and improve the utilization rate of CPs. However, the shared charging scheme implemented by third-party platforms faces the issue of trust lacking. This paper proposes a blockchain architecture for shared charging, which can use the blockchain to build a trust environment involving private pile owners, charging pile(CP) operators, Electric Vehicle(EV) users, etc.. The blockchain architecture also contains the block structure where pointer was added for quick search, contract content that can automatically execute multi-party contracts to achieve secure computing and reputation-based incentive mechanism to provide high-quality charging services in detail. This architecture establishes the multi-party trust environment for shared charging from three aspects: secure storage, secure computing, and secure incentives.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city, prevalent pub/sub (publish/subscribe) streaming systems have been increasingly employed as upstream middleware layer in multi-tenant edge clouds, and feed large volume of data gathered from IoT devices of different tenants into downstream systems (e.g., data analytics and warehouse). A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain. Our security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that BPS outperforms the state-of-the-art pub/sub streaming system Kafka in security with minimal performance overhead.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46\% uniqueness and 2.38\% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

In this system, a master-slave blockchain architecture supporting distributed cross-domain authentication is designed. Then, an improved Byzantine Fault Tolerance based on reputation value model (RIBFT)is proposed for trusted authentication and data traceability.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE.},

	abstract = {The ongoing discussion regarding blockchain technologies is focused primarily on cryptocurrencies, but blockchain features and functionalities have developed beyond financial instruments. As the technologies provide new functionalities, the associated value proposition changes as well. This study explores the relationship between blockchain technologies and their underlying value drivers. Four identified distinct blockchain stages of increased maturity are analyzed and discussed. This covers the evolutionary technology types focused on transactions, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and the introduction of artificial intelligence supporting decentralized decision making. In addition, we address management issues around appropriate blockchain adoption using a blockchain value driver-focused framework that gives decision makers actionable questions and recommendations. We provide practitioners with a method for assessing suitable blockchain adoption that addresses the specific value creation associated with a given organizational strategy. For academics, we critically identify and assess the characteristics of the blockchain stages and their strategy implications and provide a structured approach conceptualizing blockchain technology evolution.},

	abstract = {The high energy consumption of HPC systems is an obstacle for ever-growing systems. Unfortunately, energy consumption does not decrease linearly with reduced workload; therefore, energy conservation techniques have been deployed on various levels which steer the overall system. While the overall saving of energy is useful, the price of energy is not necessarily proportional to the consumption. Particularly with renewable energies, there are occasions in which the price is significantly lower. The potential of saving energy costs when using smart contracts with energy providers is lacking research. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the potential savings when applying cost-aware schedulers to data center workloads while considering power contracts that allow for dynamic (hourly) pricing. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) the theoretic assessment of cost savings; (2) the development of a simulator to replay batch scheduler traces which supports flexible energy cost models and various cost-aware scheduling algorithms. This allows to approximate the energy costs savings of data centers for various scenarios including off-peak and hourly budgeted energy prices as provided by the energy spot market. An evaluation is conducted with four annual job traces from the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ). The theoretic analysis indicates a cost savings for 4–8\% when shutting down unused client nodes, and 6–20\% with hourly cost models and optimal scheduling. The experimental validation of a practicable scheduler increases the accuracy against the theoretical best case analysis. As expected, a cost-efficient scheduling algorithm that is fed with the information about future energy costs shifts the jobs to the timeslots where the job execution is cheaper and reduces the energy expenditure, yet increases the waiting times of pending jobs. However, the expected savings for this effort are not justifiable compared to the simple strategy of turning off the unused nodes. Additionally, we compare the cost savings to the total costs of ownership showing that smaller systems with on-demand provisioning yield better cost efficiency.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a leading field of computer science, which simplifies the life of human beings. The IoT, devices can interconnect and communicate with each other, in a fully autonomous mode. This autonomy has made the IoT network vulnerable to various security threats. However, due to this autonomy, there is a strong need for reliable security and storage mechanism for authentication to exchange data between IoT devices. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient method known as SCAB-IoTA, which ensures identification and authentication of IoT devices and also provides secure communication in the open environment. Along with authentication and secure communication, the scheme also ensures data integrity. SCAB-IoTA used the blockchain and hybrid cryptosystem (the combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptographic techniques) to enhance the security of IoT applications to prevent various attacks along with less computational, and storage overhead. Furthermore, we have a secure cluster of IoT devices based on angular distance (AD), so that devices can securely communicate without any interruption. A secure and robust trust mechanism has employed to build these clusters, where each IoT device has to authenticate itself before joining the cluster. The obtained results satisfy the IoT security requirements with 60\% reduced computation, storage and communication cost compared with state-of-the-art methods. The security analysis illustrates that SCAB-IoTA withstands against various cyberattacks such as impersonation, message replay, man-in-the-middle, and botnet attacks.},

	abstract = {Those attempting to integrate building information modeling (BIM) and blockchain soon encounter the enormous challenge of information redundancy. Storage of duplicated building information in decentralized ledgers already creates redundancy, and this is exacerbated as the BIM model develops and is utilized. This paper presents a novel semantic differential transaction (SDT) approach to minimizing information redundancy in the nascent field of BIM and blockchain integration. Whereas the conventional thinking is to store an entire BIM model or its signature code in blockchain, SDT captures local model changes as SDT records and assembles them into a BIM change contract (BCC). In this way, the version history of a BIM project becomes a chain of timestamped BCCs, and stakeholders can promptly synchronize BIM changes in blockchain. We test our approach in two pilot cases. The results show that SDT captures, in near real time, sequential and simultaneous BIM changes at {\textless}0.02\% of the Industry Foundation Classes file size. We also prove model restoration from the lightweight BCCs in a small-scale BIM project. In addressing the fundamental issue of information redundancy in BIM and blockchain integration, this research can help the industry advance beyond the rhetoric to develop operable blockchain BIM systems.},

	abstract = {Since Facebook officially changed its name to Meta in Oct. 2021, the metaverse has become a new norm of social networks and three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds. The metaverse aims to bring 3D immersive and personalized experiences to users by leveraging many pertinent technologies. Despite great attention and benefits, a natural question in the metaverse is how to secure its users’ digital content and data. In this regard, blockchain is a promising solution owing to its distinct features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we aim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the metaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and highlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next, we extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from technical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing, data interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we first discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how blockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on key-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things, digital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial intelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the role of blockchain in metaverse applications and services. Finally, we present some promising directions to drive further research innovations and developments toward the use of blockchain in the metaverse in the future.},
