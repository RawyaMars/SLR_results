	abstract = {The huge increase in the communication network rate has made the application fields and scenarios for vehicular ad hoc networks more abundant and diversified and proposed more requirements for the efficiency and quality of data transmission. To improve the limited communication distance and poor communication quality of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), an optimal intelligent routing algorithm is proposed in this paper. Combined multi-weight decision algorithm with the greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol, designed and evaluated standardized function for link stability. Linear additive weighting is used to optimize link stability and distance to improve the packet delivery rate of the IoV. The blockchain system is used as the storage structure for relay data, and the smart contract incentive algorithm based on machine learning is used to encourage relay vehicles to provide more communication bandwidth for data packet transmission. The proposed scheme is simulated and analyzed under different scenarios and different parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the packet loss rate and improve system performance. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {With the blooming of blockchain-based smart contracts in decentralized applications, the security problem of smart contracts has become a critical issue, as vulnerable contracts have resulted in severe financial losses. Existing research works have explored vulnerability detection methods based on fuzzing, symbolic execution, formal verification, and static analysis. In this paper, we propose two static analysis approaches called ASGVulDetector and BASGVulDetector for detecting vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contacts from source-code and bytecode perspectives, respectively. First, we design a novel intermediate representation called abstract semantic graph (ASG) to capture both syntactic and semantic features from the program. ASG is based on syntax information but enriched by code structures, such as control flow and data flow. Then, we apply two different training models, i.e., graph neural network (GNN) and graph matching network (GMN), to learn the embedding of ASG and measure the similarity of the contract pairs. In this way, vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by calculating the similarity to labeled ones. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the superiority of our approaches to state-of-the-art competitors. Specifically, ASGVulDetector improves the best of three source-code-only static analysis tools (i.e., SmartCheck, Slither, and DR-GCN) regarding the F1 score by 12.6% on average, while BASGVulDetector improves that of the three detection tools supporting bytecode (i.e., ContractFuzzer, Oyente, and Securify) regarding the F1 score by 25.6% on average. We also investigate the effectiveness and advantages of the GMN model for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an on-device distributed learning scheme that does not require training devices to transfer their data to a centralized facility. The goal of federated learning is to learn a global model over several iterations. It is challenging to claim ownership rights and commercialize the global model efficiently and transparently. Additionally, incentives need to be provided to ensure that devices participate in the FL process. In this paper, we propose a smart contract-based framework called FL-Incentivizer, which relies on custom smart contracts to maintain flow governance of the FL process in a transparent and immutable manner. FL-Incentivizer commercializes and tokenizes the global model using FL-NFT (FL Non-Fungible Token) based on the ERC-721 standard. FL-Incentivizer uses ERC-20 compliant FL-Tokens to incentivize devices participating in FL. We present the system design and operational sequence of the FL-Incentivizer. We provide implementation and deployment details, complete smart contract codes, and qualitative evaluation of the FL-Incentivizer. After implementing FL-Incentivizer for a global iteration of a Federated learning task, we showed the FL-NFT on OpenSea and an FL-Token for a learner on MetaMask. FL-NFTs can be traded on markets such as OpenSea like other NFTs. While FL-Tokens can be transferred in the same manner as other ERC-20-based tokens.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As computer programs run on top of blockchain, smart contracts have proliferated a myriad of decentralized applications while bringing security vulnerabilities, which may cause huge financial losses. Thus, it is crucial and urgent to detect the vulnerabilities of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers for smart contracts are still inefficient to detect sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific vulnerable transaction sequences to trigger. To address this challenge, we propose a novel vulnerability-guided fuzzer based on reinforcement learning, namely RLF, for generating vulnerable transaction sequences to detect such sophisticated vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In particular, we firstly model the process of fuzzing smart contracts as a Markov decision process to construct our reinforcement learning framework. We then creatively design an appropriate reward with consideration of both vulnerability and code coverage so that it can effectively guide our fuzzer to generate specific transaction sequences to reveal vulnerabilities, especially for the vulnerabilities related to multiple functions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RLF's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our RLF outperforms state-of-the-art vulnerability-detection tools (e.g., detecting 8%-69% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes).  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The Ethereum blockchain permits the development and deployment of smart contracts which can store and execute code “on-chain” — that is, entirely on nodes in the blockchain’s network. Smart contracts have traditionally been used for financial purposes, but since smart contracts are Turing-complete, their algorithmic scope is broader than any single domain. To that end, we design, develop, and deploy a comprehensive 3D rendering engine programmed entirely in Ethereum smart contracts, called Shackled. Shackled computes a 2D image from a 3D scene, executing every single computation on-chain, on Ethereum. To our knowledge, Shackled is the first and only fully on-chain 3D rendering engine for Ethereum. In this work, we 1) provide three unique datasets for the purpose of using and benchmarking Shackled, 2) execute said benchmarks and provide results, 3) demonstrate a potential use case of Shackled in the domain of tokenised generative art, 4) provide a no-code user interface to Shackled, 5) enumerate the challenges associated with programming complex algorithms in Solidity smart contracts, and 6) outline potential directions for improving the Shackled platform. It is our hope that this work increases the Ethereum blockchain’s native graphics processing capabilities, and that it enables increased use of smart contracts for more complex algorithms, thus increasing the overall richness of the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Due to centralized storage, centralization problems are common in machine learning model training and invocation, which makes train data and trained models extremely vulnerable to tampering and stealing. A safe framework for training and invoking models called ISC-MTI (IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Smart Contract-Based Method for Storage and Invocation of Machine Learning Mobel) is proposed in this paper. The framework uses IPFS as the storage solution, EOS (Enterprise Operation System) blockchain as the smart contract platform, RSA and AES as the implementation of encrypted communication. The Action responsible for invoking the training data and trained models in the smart contract and the model training, uploading, and invoking methods are designed. The experimental results demonstrate that ISC-MTI can improve the safety of model training and invocation with losing a little efficiency. Simultaneously, ISC-MTI can provide anti-theft model capabilities, traceability, tamper resistance, reliability, and privacy for the process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The data economy is based on data and information sharing and tremendously impacts society as it facilitates innovative collaborations and decision-making strategies. Nonetheless, most dataset-sharing solutions rely on a centralized authority that rules data ownership, availability, and accessibility. Recent works have explored the integration of distributed storage and blockchain to enhance decentralization, data access, and smart contracts for automating the interactions between actors and data. However, current solutions propose a smart contract design limiting the system’s scalability in terms of actors and shared datasets. Furthermore, little is known about the performance of these architectures when using distributed storage instead of centralized storage approaches. This paper proposes a scalable architecture called DeBlock for data sharing in a trusted way among unreliable actors. The architecture integrates a public blockchain that provides a transparent record of datasets and interactions, with a distributed storage for data storage in a completely decentralized way. Furthermore, the architecture provides a smart-contract design for a transparent catalog of datasets, actors, and interactions with efficient search and retrieval capabilities. To assess the system’s feasibility, robustness, and scalability, we implement a prototype using the Ethereum blockchain and leveraging two decentralized storage protocols, Swarm and IPFS. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system in different scenarios (e.g., varying the amount and size of the shared datasets). Our results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms benchmarks in gas consumption, latency, and resource requirements, especially when increasing the number of actors and shared datasets. © 2022 by the authors.},

This new architecture has the ability to monitor the environment, collect data, analyze it, process it using an AI-expert engine, provide predictions and actionable outcomes, and finally share it on a public blockchain platform. For the use-case implementation, the pandemic caused by the wide and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was used to test and evaluate the proposed system. Recently, various authors traced the spread of viruses in sewage water and studied how it can be used as a tracking system. Early warning notifications can allow governments and organizations to take appropriate actions at the earliest stages possible. The system was validated experimentally using 14 Raspberry Pis, and the results and analyses proved that the system is able to utilize low-cost and low-power flexible IoT hardware at the processing layer to detect COVID-19 and predict its spread using the AI engine, with an accuracy of 95%, and share the outcome over the blockchain platform. This is accomplished when the platform is secured by the honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) and without any substantial impact on the devices' power sources, as there was only a power consumption increase of 7% when the Raspberry Pi was used for blockchain mining and 14% when used to produce an AI prediction.  © 2013 IEEE.},

It is often challenging to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name, location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors' lack of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to donors.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the blockchain, smart contract technology has been widely applied. The number of smart contracts has grown at a high rate and nearly at an average of thousands per day. However, the correctness and security of the smart contract itself are facing huge problems. The well-known DAO vulnerability, and Parity multi-signature wallet’ vulnerabilities have leaded to a hundreds of millions dollars loss, and they are both caused by the security problems of smart contracts. Once the smart contract vulnerability is exploited, it is very likely to bring the loss of cryptocurrencies, the disorder of the financial order and other catastrophic consequences. Therefore the security of smart contracts is imminent. This project has designed and implemented a vulnerability detection system of Ethereum smart contract. The system uses the assembly instruction sequences of the smart contract to generate the control flow graph, then performs symbolic execution and vulnerability constraint solving over the control flow. The system can detect some common types of vulnerabilities, such as the integer overflow and underflow vulnerability, reentry vulnerability and unchecked call return value vulnerability. It has a high accuracy of detection result, and gives support for export vulnerability report. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Software licenses are legal agreements of sale and usage among software developers and clients. Such legal agreements are crucial to effectively manage ownership and protect the rights of involved parties. Today's software licensing mechanisms are mostly centralized and do not address the ever-increasing issues and complexities of modern software that may include multiple licenses, open-source distribution, rewarding other contributors of external software libraries, and utilizing royalty payments for monetization. As a result, developers have lost confidence in the existing software licensing models, and many software projects are failing due to lack of funding and royalty payments. This paper addresses such issues and complexities by proposing a novel decentralized software licensing system based on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. The proposed licensing system is applicable to both commercial and open-source software. We use NFTs as digital tokens that encapsulate software code and their artifacts by minting them as unique valuable assets that allow developers to store and manage them on a blockchain ledger. With NFTs, developers can register and license their code, monetize it on NFT marketplaces, and earn royalties from other software projects that use their code. We present system architecture, relevant sequence diagrams, and develop aggregation algorithms for Ethereum smart contracts with ERC-1155 NFTs. Furthermore, we perform functional validation of our system and analyze the cost of its adoption. We also analyze the security of the solution and show how its applicability can be generalized and extended.

	abstract = {K-anonymity has been gaining widespread attention as one of the most widely used technologies to protect location privacy. Nevertheless, there are still some threats such as behavior deception and service swing, since utilizing distributed k-anonymity technology to construct an anonymous domain. More specifically, the coordinate of the honest node will be a leak if the malicious nodes submit wrong locations coordinate to take part in the domain construction process. Worse still, owing to service swing, the attacker increases the reputation illegally to deceive honest nodes again. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a trusted de-swinging k-anonymity scheme for location privacy protection. Primarily, we introduce a de-swinging reputation evaluation method (DREM), which designs a penalty factor to curb swinging behavior. This method calculates the reputation from entity honesty degree, location information entropy, and service swing degree. Besides, based on our proposed DREM, a credible cloaking area is constructed to protect the location privacy of the requester. In the area, nodes can choose some nodes with a high reputation for completing the construction process of the anonymous domain. Finally, we design reputation contracts to calculate credit automatically based on smart contracts. The security analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme effectively resists malicious attacks, curbs the service swing, and encourages nodes to participate honestly in the construction of cloaking areas. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Due to aggressive urbanization (with population size), waste increases exponentially, resulting in environmental damage. Even though it looks challenging, such an issue can be controlled if we can reuse them. To handle this, in our work, we design a machine learning and blockchain-oriented system that identifies the waste objects/products and recommends to the user multiple 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) ideas to reuse or recycle. Blockchain records every transaction in the shared ledger to enable transaction verifiability and supports better decision-making. In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on about 11700 images is developed using ResNet50 architecture for object recognition (training accuracy of 94%). We deploy several smart contracts in the Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain platform to validate recommended DIY ideas by blockchain network members. HF is a decentralized ledger technology platform that executes the deployed smart contracts in a secured Docker container to initialize and manage the ledger state. The complete model is delivered on a web platform using Flask, where our recommendation system works on a web scraping script written using Python. Fetching DIY ideas using web-scraping takes nearly 1 second on a desktop machine with an Intel Core-i7 processor with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, installed with Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system, and Python 3.6 package. Further, we evaluate blockchain-based smart contracts' latencies and throughput performances using the hyperledger caliper benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates blockchain technology and deep learning for the DIY recommender system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain ecosystems are rapidly maturing and meeting the needs of business environ-ments (e.g., industry, manufacturing, and robotics). The decentralized approaches in industries enable novel business concepts, such as machine autonomy and servitization of manufacturing envi-ronments. Introducing the distributed ledger technology principles into the machine sharing and servitization economy faces several challenges, and the integration opens new interesting research questions. Our research focuses on data and event models and secure upgradeable smart contract platforms for machine servitization. Our research indicates that with the proposed approaches, we can efficiently separate on-and off-chain data and assure scalability of the DApp without compro-mising the trust. We demonstrate that the secure upgradeable smart contract platform, which was adapted for machine servitization, supports the business workflow and, at the same time, assures common identification and authorization of all the participants in the system, including people, de-vices, and legal entities. We present a hybrid decentralized application (DApp) for the servitization of 3D printing. The solution can be used for or easily adapted to other manufacturing domains. It comprises a modular, upgradeable smart contract platform and off-chain machine, customer and web management, and monitoring interfaces. We pay special attention to the data and event models during the design, which are fundamental for the hybrid data storage and DApp architecture and the responsiveness of off-chain interfaces. The smart contract platform uses a proxy contract to control the access of smart contracts and role-based access control in function calls for blockchain users. We deploy and evaluate the DApp in a consortium blockchain network for performance and pri-vacy. All the actors in the solution, including the machines, are identified by their blockchain ac-counts and are compeers. Our solution thus facilitates integration with the traditional information-communication systems in terms of the hybrid architectures and security standards for smart contract design comparable to those in traditional software engineering. © 2022 by the authors.

Anyhow, decentralization comes at the cost of certain disadvantages, such as increased application complexity or communication overhead. This aggravates the development and deployment of decentralized services and applications. In this paper we present Blade, a software platform that aims to ease the effort of development and deployment of decentralized services by implementing reusable solutions for recurring challenges developers are facing when designing decentralized service architectures. Blade implements such functionality in a Blade server instance, which can be deployed on a lightweight device, such as a NAS, Raspberry Pi, or router at home. This allows users without expert knowledge to run a Blade instance with already existing hardware with little overhead. Blade supports polyglot Blade modules that implement extended functionality, such as interfaces, frontends, and business logic of decentralized applications. Blade modules are installed via a decentralized, Ethereum-based marketplace that can be accessed via the Blade instances. For identity management, Blade relays on smart contracts, which implement an Ethereum-based registry. This allows users to create and manage their identities in a self-sovereign manner without the need of a central entity. This way, Blade builds a decentralized service ecosystem that supports developers of decentralized applications and services. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology in recent years, all kinds of blockchain-based applications have emerged. Among them, the decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which is regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the real-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. However, due to the deterministic nature of blockchain, the blockchain cannot directly obtain indeterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have appeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain applications. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study on oracles, especially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application scenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by categorizing them into several types based on their design features. After that, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use (such as Chainlink and Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data validation process, and their incentive mechanisms. Then, we compare these present DeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness, data source trustworthiness and their overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing trustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a few promising techniques for building future trustworthiness oracles.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes have long been proposed to solve problem of how to check the integrity of data stored in cloud service without downloading. However, with the emerging of network consisting of low performance devices such as Internet of Things, we find that there are still two obstacles for applying PDP schemes. The first one is the heavy computation overhead in generating tags for data blocks, which is essential for setting up any PDP scheme. The other one is how to resist collusion attacks from third party auditors with any possible entities participating the auditing. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based light-weighted PDP scheme for low performance devices, with an instance deployed on a cloud server. We design a secure outsourced tag generating method for low performance devices, which enables a kind of “hash-sign-switch” two-phase tag computing. With this method, users with low performance devices can employ third party auditors to compute modular exponential operations that accounts for the largest portion of computation overhead in tag generation, without leaking their data content. Chaincodes in blockchain network ensure the correctness of such outsourcing and prevent collusion attacks. The security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme is both secure and efficient. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

An NFT represents ownership of a unique item that is stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed, replaced, and copied. The current NFT ecosystem falls short in trust features and is prone to illegitimate users, threats, and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for the NFT ecosystem that incorporates registration of the participating actors, involves a decentralized reputation system, provides incentives to its users through rewards, and penalizes misconduct. Our system design is built to ensure trust and credibility in the NFT ecosystem. The proposed solution leverages blockchain's intrinsic security features such as transparency, tamper-proof logs, data integrity, accountability, and non-repudiation. We use the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store the NFTs' metadata, whereas their hash is stored on the chain. We present algorithms along with their implementation, testing, and validation details. We demonstrate how our solution, as well as smart contract code, is secure enough against common security threats and attacks.

However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. In this article, we present SocialChain, which is a decentralized social data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and social applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the social data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner. We develop a software prototype based on Ethereum and conduct case studies to test the effects of the adopted techniques on the performance. Experimental results show that SocialChain can provide easy-to-use interfaces while introducing relatively low latency, cost, and overhead and that it can support real-world social media applications.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and verification of a blockchain-based online electronic voting system that ensures accuracy and reliability in electronic voting and its application to various types of voting using blockchain technologies, such as distributed ledgers and smart contracts. Specifically, in this study, the connection between the electronic voting system and blockchain nodes is simplified using the REST API design, and the voting opening and counting information is designed to store the latest values in the distributed ledger in JSON format, using a smart contract that cannot be falsified. The developed electronic voting system can provide blockchain authentication, secret voting, forgery prevention, ballot verification, and push notification functions, all of which are currently not supported in existing services. Furthermore, the developed system demonstrates excellence on all evaluation items, including 101 transactions per second (TPS) of blockchain online authentication, 57.6 TPS of secret voting services, 250 TPS of forgery prevention cases, 547 TPS of read transaction processing, and 149 TPS of write transaction processing, along with 100% ballot verification service, secret ballot authentication, and encryption accuracy. Functional and performance verifications were obtained through an external test certification agency in South Korea. Our design allows for blockchain authentication, non-forgery of ballot counting data, and secret voting through blockchain-based distributed ledger technology. In addition, we demonstrate how existing electronic voting systems can be easily converted to blockchain-based electronic voting systems by applying a blockchain-linked REST API. This study greatly contributes to enabling electronic voting using blockchain technology through cost reductions, information restoration, prevention of misrepresentation, and transparency enhancement for a variety of different forms of voting.

	abstract = {Blockchain is a promising technology for future dynamic spectrum access (DSA) management due to its decentralization, immutability, and traceability. However, many challenges need to be addressed to integrate the blockchain to DSA, such as the trustworthiness of participating nodes' spectrum sensing results, privacy protection of sensing nodes' identities, and affordable lightweight consensus algorithms for IoT devices. In this article, we propose a trust-centric privacy-preserving blockchain for DSA in IoT networks. To be specific, we propose a trust evaluation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensing nodes and design a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to build a scalable blockchain with high transaction-per-second (TPS). Moreover, a privacy protection scheme is proposed to protect sensors' real-time geolocation information when they upload sensing data to the blockchain. Two smart contracts are designed to make the whole procedure (spectrum sensing, spectrum auction, and spectrum allocation) run automatically. Simulation results demonstrate the expected computation cost of the PoT consensus algorithm for reliable nodes is low, and the cooperative sensing performance is improved with the help of the trust evaluation mechanism. In addition, incentivization and security are also analyzed, which show that our system can not only encourage nodes' participation, but also resist many kinds of attacks which are frequently arise in the trust management mechanism and blockchain-based IoT systems.  © 2014 IEEE.},

Moreover, it consists of several tiny sensors to sense the environment and gather the information. These devices continuously monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and transfer the captured data to nearby devices or servers using an open channel, i.e., in-ternet. However, such centralized system based on IIoT provides more vulnerabilities to security and privacy in IIoT networks. In order to resolve these issues, we present a blockchain-based deep-learning framework that provides two levels of security and privacy. First a blockchain scheme is designed where each participating entities are registered, verified, and thereafter validated using smart contract based enhanced Proof of Work, to achieve the target of security and privacy. Second, a deep-learning scheme with a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) technique for privacy and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for intrusion detection is designed. The experimental results are based on the IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets that are publicly available. The proposed simulations results are compared with the benchmark models and it is validated that the proposed framework outperforms the existing system. © 2022 by the authors.

To address this problem, we propose a consortium blockchain network to record evidence transfer events among different departments of China's judicial system. We design the format of a transaction and a block. In addition, the smart contracts for three types of transactions are also proposed. The Raft consensus algorithm is adopted to accomplish the consensus process. A security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the design goal (the integrity, consistency, and nonrepudiation of evidence transfer records stored in blockchain). Furthermore, a set of experiments were conducted to analyse the performance of the proposed scheme. The experiments results show that the throughput of the system is proportional to the send rate within a certain threshold. The latency decreases with increasing send rate if the send rate is within a certain threshold. Peer nodes in the system consume the most storage and communication cost. The values of block size and block generation interval time have a slight influence on the performance of the system.  © 2022 Jingjing Guo et al.},

	abstract = {The healthcare industry faces serious problems with health data. Firstly, health data is fragmented and its quality needs to be improved. Data fragmentation means that it is difficult to integrate the patient data stored by multiple health service providers. The quality of these heterogeneous data also needs to be improved for better utilization. Secondly, data sharing among patients, healthcare service providers and medical researchers is inadequate. Thirdly, while sharing health data, patients’ right to privacy must be protected, and patients should have authority over who can access their data. In traditional health data sharing system, because of centralized management, data can easily be stolen, manipulated. These systems also ignore patient’s authority and privacy. Researchers have proposed some blockchain-based health data sharing solutions where blockchain is used for consensus management. Blockchain enables multiple parties who do not fully trust each other to exchange their data. However, the practice of smart contracts supporting these solutions has not been studied in detail. We propose CrowdMed-II, a health data management framework based on blockchain, which could address the above-mentioned problems of health data. We study the design of major smart contracts in our framework and propose two smart contract structures. We also introduce a novel search contract for searching patients in the framework. We evaluate their efficiency based on the execution costs on Ethereum. Our design improves on those previously proposed, lowering the computational costs of the framework. This allows the framework to operate at scale and is more feasible for widespread adoption. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Permission delegation has become a new way for data sharing by delegating the authorized permission to other users. A flexible authorization model with strict access control policies is promising for electronic health record (EHR) sharing with security. In this paper, a blockchain-based multi-hop permission delegation scheme with controllable delegation depth for EHR sharing has been presented. We use the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for storing the original EHRs. Smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology are implemented for permission delegation. In order to ensure data security, we use attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control. Additionally, blockchain is used to achieve traceability and immutability. We deploy smart contracts so that the delegation depth can be set by delegators. Security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that our solution meets the designed goals. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm and implement the scheme on the Ethereum test chain. Our scheme outperforms the competition in terms of performance, according to the results of our experiments. © 2022},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to change, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A Contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by contract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the defects and removal priority.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a layered hierarchy that depicts the progressive relationship between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. To begin with, data is gathered and organized into information. Information is gathered, filtered, refined, and put through an investigation process to create knowledge. Wisdom is attained after knowledge discovery through the process of filtration and aggregation through experience. The layered hierarchy in the domain of e-healthcare necessitates higher scheduling costs for data collection, processing wisdom, and management, which is also an insecure and untrustworthy process for progressive medical service. The medical industry faces a difficult problem in providing collected data integrity, information reliability, and knowledge trustworthiness for the service of progressive medical relationships in the face of an increasing number of day-to-day records. The blockchain consortium hyperledger (fabric) has been used in this paper to act as a bridge that bridges the gap between electronic data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) movement and processes by enabling the process of the layered hierarchy of schedule information and management and providing security and transparency. For e-healthcare information management and privacy, the DIKW-ledger, such as patients' consultancy information, availing medical services, personal records, appointments, treatment details, and other health-related transactions, a consortium hyperledger fabric-enabled efficient architecture is proposed. This proposed architecture creates two networks: A public network for medical stakeholders to exchange and agree on specific medical activities before being preserved on distributed storage (read-only after record registration) and a private network for complete DIKW process scheduling and management. We designed and created smart contracts for this purpose, as well as use-case diagrams to describe the overall execution process. The proposed architectural solution provides more efficient information integrity, provenance, and storage procedures to immutably preserve the medical ledger in a permissioned hash-encrypted structure.  © 2022 Zaffar Ahmed Shaikh et al.},

In the past, different tools and frameworks were proposed to solve communication and collaboration issues in DASD but they lacked transparency, trust, traceability, and security. These shortcomings resulted in project failure or overdue, customer dissatisfaction, project deal cancellations, and payment clashes between the customers and development teams. This paper addresses and overcomes the major issues of transparency, trust, security, traceability, coordination, and communication in DASD by embedding blockchain technology. We have proposed a novel blockchain-based framework named as AgilePlus which executes the smart contracts on a private ethereum blockchain for acceptance testing, secure payment, verification of developer's payment requirements, and automatic payment distribution into the digital wallets of development teams. The execution of these smart contracts automatically assign penalties to the customers for late or non-payments and also to the developers for overdue tasks. Moreover, we have also solved the blockchain's scalability challenge in AgilePlus by utilizing Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as off-chain storage. Lastly, experimental results prove that the proposed framework enhances transparency, communication, coordination, traceability, security and solves trust issues of both customers and developers in DASD.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), technological developments have increased the significance of federated cloud systems with integrated cloud providers for exchange transactions. Monolithic IoT systems implement service-oriented architecture (SOA), which is complex for supporting scalability and communicating transactions in a federated cloud system. One weakness of conventional security methods is that they depend on a centralized party, which means there is a single point of failure for the system. In contrast, blockchain (BC) and microservice (MS) technologies allow services to split for independent tasks. In this research paper, we introduce BC security managers based on MS technology for federated cloud systems in an IoT environment. In addition, we present the design of the Federation Security System Manager (FSSM) MS with interoperability features. This enables the exchange of transactions between permissioned BC managers at different cloud providers, with some constraints. Furthermore, a security framework based on MSs and BCs is implemented to ensure security and protect access control. The security functions are deployed based on a smart contract between the permissioned BC managers to achieve interoperability. Finally, we introduce the development process of the proposed framework, which allows for interoperability and ensures the security and privacy of the participating data for a distributed IoT based on the federated cloud system. © 2023 by the authors.},

Ride-hailing service providers (SPs) usually collect users' personal data to improve their services via big data technologies. However, SPs may also use the collected user data to apply personalized prices to different users, which raises price fairness concerns. In this paper, we propose a smart price auditing system named Spas. Spas allows a user to purchase Fair Price Insurance in the form of Price Auditing Contract, then the price of ride-hailing service (RHS) order will be audited automatically once completed. According to the auditing result, the contract punishes misbehaving SPs and also compensates affected users automatically. By replacing an untrustworthy centralized auditor with carefully designed smart contracts, we construct a decentralized price auditing system which is trustworthy and transparent. We demonstrate a theoretical model for practical payment flows based on real RHS user data and we implement Spas in Hyperledger Fabric to show that decentralizing and automating price auditing for RHS with financial incentives is technically feasible. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is always one of the major problems for service providers. Using blockchain to detect DDoS attacks is one of the current popular methods. However, the problems of high time overhead and cost exist in the most of the blockchain methods for detecting DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a blockchain-based collaborative detection method for DDoS attacks. First, the trained DDoS attack detection model is encrypted by the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which provides high security for uploading the DDoS attack detection model to the blockchain. Secondly, the service provider uploads the encrypted model to Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) and then a corresponding Content-ID (CID) is generated by IPFS which greatly saves the cost of uploading encrypted models to the blockchain. In addition, due to the small amount of model data, the time cost of uploading the DDoS attack detection model is greatly reduced. Finally, through the blockchain and smart contracts, the CID is distributed to other service providers, who can use the CID to download the corresponding DDoS attack detection model from IPFS. Blockchain provides a decentralized, trusted and tamper-proof environment for service providers. Besides, smart contracts and IPFS greatly improve the distribution efficiency of the model, while the distribution of CID greatly improves the efficiency of the transmission on the blockchain. In this way, the purpose of collaborative detection can be achieved, and the time cost of transmission on blockchain and IPFS can be considerably saved. We designed a blockchain-based DDoS attack collaborative detection framework to improve the data transmission efficiency on the blockchain, and use IPFS to greatly reduce the cost of the distribution model. In the experiment, compared with most blockchain-based method for DDoS attack detection, the proposed model using blockchain distribution shows the advantages of low cost and latency. The remote authentication mechanism of Intel SGX provides high security and integrity, and ensures the availability of distributed models. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The dominance of a few big companies in the storage market arising various concerns including single point of failure, privacy violation, and oligopoly. To eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj have been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage platform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the storage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers during a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to continuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of the storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore end-users. Moreover, DSN&#x0027;s PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying attack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while denying the service to the client. Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper introduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is conducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage service as a non-cooperative repeated dynamic game and set the players&#x0027; payoffs such that the storage provider&#x0027;s dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage contract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle network to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider efficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain platform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract execution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme using solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis demonstrates the applicability of our scheme. The outcome of this paper is a new incentive-compatible mechanism designed carefully for the blockchain-based DSN. The proposed mechanism utilizes different tools including game-theory, smart-contract, oracle network, and Merkle tree to improve the security and performance of storage verification in DSN. IEEE},

	abstract = {With the rapidly developing of Internet of Things (IoT), the volume of data generated by IoT systems is increasing quickly. To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is a small country with a large population. Its increasingly developing economy further makes land a lucrative source of fixed capital. On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh. © 2020 The Authors},

Several applications were developed in the last few years for blockchain based - traceability systems. Most of the work concentrated on information retrieval and system scalability. Still, promising research has not been seen for a blockchain traceability system with user identification methods. This work presents a blockchain system with user identification and access control mechanisms to fill the gap for each supply chain participant. In addition, the system also proposes a novel Proof of Transaction (PoTx) consensus algorithm designed to achieve scalability with reduced communication overhead and computation power. A novel PoTx algorithm is developed by choosing a random validator from a consensus group based on the transaction count to enforce the fault-tolerance of the system.

	abstract = {Enterprises have paid attention to consortium blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric, which is one of the most promising platforms, for efficient decentralized transactions without depending on any particular organization. A consortium blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple organizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across multiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the value of introducing consortium blockchains. Decentralized system operations have recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of consortium blockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which individual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command execution of configuration change of channels (Fabric’s sub-networks) and upgrade of chaincodes (Fabric’s smart contracts), can be partially executed in a decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include the preceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the operational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations, after which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure relies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient decentralized operations workflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose a decentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations Smart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart contract. Furthermore, we design and implement OpsSC for blockchain network operations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC for operating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the blockchain networks, through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations. A cost evaluation based on an estimation model shows that the total operational cost for executing a typical operational scenario to add an organization to a blockchain network having ten organizations could be reduced by 54 percent compared with a conventional script-based method. The implementation of OpsSC has been open-sourced and registered as one of Hyperledger Labs projects, which hosts experimental projects approved by Hyperledger. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

In this article, we propose a plastic credit driven system consisting of a recyclability index (RI) and plastic credit to impel plastic recycling and increase the quality of recyclable plastics through a market self-regulation mechanism. The RI is designed to evaluate the recyclability value of different plastic products based on their material compositions. The plastic credit, defined by the quantitative relation between the RI and product information, can be issued or traded by system stakeholders. Instead of setting rigid industry standards to regulate plastic quality, we construct a governance community among industry participants using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to self-regulate and monitor plastic production and trading. The proposed system is constructed on a consortium blockchain and a public blockchain to negotiate the RI, issue credits, and trade credits using smart contracts. Through the overall system performance analysis, the experimental results demonstrate that the designed plastic credit system can promote a demand shift toward plastic products with higher plastic recyclability and achieve a lightweight operation for resource requirements and system maintenance.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are the building blocks of the “code is law” paradigm: the smart contract’s code indisputably describes how its assets are to be managed - once it is created, its code is typically immutable. Faulty smart contracts present the most significant evidence against the practicality of this paradigm; they are well-documented and resulted in assets worth vast sums of money being compromised. To address this issue, the Ethereum community proposed (i) tools and processes to audit/analyse smart contracts, and (ii) design patterns implementing a mechanism to make contract code mutable. Individually, (i) and (ii) only partially address the challenges raised by the “code is law” paradigm. In this paper, we combine elements from (i) and (ii) to create a systematic framework that moves away from “code is law” and gives rise to a new “specification is law” paradigm. It allows contracts to be created and upgraded but only if they meet a corresponding formal specification. The framework is centered around a trusted deployer: an off-chain service that formally verifies and enforces this notion of conformance. We have prototyped this framework, and investigated its applicability to contracts implementing three widely used Ethereum standards: the ERC20 Token Standard, ERC3156 Flash Loans and ERC1155 Multi Token Standard, with promising results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Since its inception more than a decade ago, blockchain technology has been quickly adopted by a large number of sectors, including finance, healthcare, energy supply, and logistics, due to its numerous benefits, such as decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. However, blockchain applications are intrinsically complex, as they are heterogeneous in nature and require cooperation and interoperation with non-blockchain systems. The complexity of the blockchain systems is further exacerbated by the lack of a clear understanding of their composition. This paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing a taxonomy for characterizing blockchain systems. The proposed taxonomy classifies a blockchain system into a hierarchy of components: At the top level, the system is organized into an external subsystem, an internal subsystem and an execution environment subsystem. These subsystems are then decomposed into eight fundamental components: Platform, Network, Distributed Ledger, Smart Contract, Consensus Protocol, Digital Wallet, Token, and Node. Each component is further divided into different aspects and each aspect is characterized by various features. This taxonomy thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the composition of a blockchain system, which can better inform software developers in their design and implementation of blockchain systems. The paper presents and illustrates the proposed taxonomy through some application scenarios and a case study.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In MDAsmartCD, model transformations (model-to-model and model-to-text) are used to produce smart contract code in the Hyperledger Fabric platform Go and the Ethereum platform Solidity programming languages. The method application was demonstrated by implementing the smart contract for the hackathon solution and executing the generated Solidity and Go smart contracts in the workflow of issuing certificates for hackathon participants. During the execution of the workflow, both deployed smart contracts behaved identically and recorded analogous results in respective blockchain data storages. This demonstrated that the MDAsmartCD method enables the generation of compilable and executable smart contract code, ready for deployment on a blockchain platform. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As everything linking to the internet, people can subscribe to various services from a service provider to facilitate their lives through the Internet of Things (IoT). An obligatory thing for the service provider is that they should push the service data safely and timely to multiple IoT terminal devices regularly after the IoT devices accomplishing the service subscription. In order to control the service message received by the legal devices as while as keep the confidentiality of the data, the public key encryption algorithm is utilized. While the existing public encryption algorithms for push service are too complicated for IoT devices, and almost of the current subscription schemes based on push mode are relying on centralized organization which may suffer from centralized entity corruption or single point of failure. To address these issues, we design a secure subscription-push service scheme based on blockchain and edge computing in this article, which is decentralized with secure architecture for the subscription and push of service. Furthermore, inspired by broadcast encryption and multicast encryption, a new encryption algorithm is designed to manage the permissions of IoT devices together with smart contract, and to protect the confidentiality of push messages, which is suitable for IoT devices. The edge computing nodes, in the new system architecture, maintain the blockchain to ensure the impartiality and traceability of service subscriptions and push messages, meanwhile undertake some calculations for IoT devices with limited computing power. The legalities of subscription services are guaranteed by verifying subscription tags on the smart contract. Lastly, the analysis indicates that the scheme is reliable, and the proposed encryption algorithm is safe and efficient. Copyright © 2022 KSII.},

	abstract = {Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system. The study discovered a significant influence of information quality and user satisfaction. On the contrary, system quality seems to have an almost significant influence on the use and user satisfaction of the proposed system. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoTs) is an integrated network collection of heterogeneous objects which enable seamless integration between systems, humans, devices, and various other things, to support pervasive computing for smart systems. IoT-driven systems and sensors continuously ingest data resulting in an increased volume and velocity of information which can lead to critical concerns such as security of the data and scalability of the system. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) is a specific genre of IoTs in which data related to oceanic ecosystems is continuously sensed through underwater sensors. IoUT has emerged as an innovative paradigm to support smart oceans. However, there are several critical challenges which IoUT system designers must consider such as (1) scalability of the system to handle large volumes of oceanic data and (2) security of data that is transmitted from IoT sensors deployed underwater. Blockchain as a newly emerged technology and an enabling platform allows decentralized and secure transmission of data among a wide group of untrustworthy parties. This research aims to exploit blockchain technology to secure IoUT data transmission by exploiting Interplanetary File System (IPFS) method. Additionally, this study also addresses the system’s scalability in two aspects, (1) scalability, and (2) security. We used a case study-based approach and performed experiments to evaluate the proposed solution’s usability and efficiency in terms of query response (i.e., performance), and algorithmic execution (i.e., efficiency). The proposed solution unifies blockchain technologies to secure IoT-driven systems and provides guidelines to engineer and develop next-generation of robust and secure blockchain-aided distributed IoT systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The increased use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices - from basic sensors to robust embedded computers - has boosted the demand for information processing and storing solutions closer to these devices. Edge computing has been established as a standard architecture for developing IoT solutions, since it can optimize the workload and capacity of systems that depend on cloud services by deploying necessary computing power close to where the information is being produced and consumed. However, as the network scale in size, reaching consensus becomes an increasingly challenging task. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), which can be described as a network of distributed databases that incorporate cryptography, can be leveraged to achieve consensus among participants. In recent years DLTs have gained traction due to the popularity of blockchains, the most-well known type of implementation. The reliability and trust that can be achieved through transparent and traceable transactions are other key concepts that bring IoT and DLT together. We present the design, development and conducted experiments of a proof-of-concept system that uses DLT smart contracts for efficiently selecting edge nodes for offloading computational tasks. In particular, we integrate network performance indicators in smart contracts with a Hyperledger Blockchain to optimize the offloading on computation under dynamic connectivity solutions. The proposed method can be applied to networks with varied topologies and different means of connectivity. Our results show the applicability of blockchain smart contracts to a variety of industrial use cases.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Aiming at the problems of policy centralization and single point of failure in traditional access control schemes, a distributed access control method based on adaptive trust evaluation and smart contract is proposed to provide fine-grained, flexible and scalable authorization for IoT devices with limited resources. Firstly, a modular access control architecture with integrated blockchain is proposed to achieve hierarchical management of IoT devices. Secondly, an IoT trust evaluation model called AITTE based on adaptive fusion weights is designed to effectively improve the identification of illegal access requests from malicious nodes. Finally, an attribute-based access control model using smart contract called AACSC which is built, which consists of attribute set contract (ASC), registration contract (RC), state judgment contract (SJC), authority permission management contract (AMC), and access control contract (ACC). As experimental results show, the scheme can effectively solve the problem of access security in resource-constrained IoT environments. Moreover, it also ensures the reliability and efficiency of the access control implementation process. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge computing mode has emerged in recent years to overcome the shortcomings of traditional cloud computing mode, such as high delay, network congestion, and large resource consumption. Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic cloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT devices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is how to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double auction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource allocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management agencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we introduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with transaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize resources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based system are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in this paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial double auction mechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the revenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a resource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It can not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also ensure privacy security. Through necessary theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms can be validated. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation for future studies focused on enhancing trust in AI applications through the integration of BCT.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The data in the smart contract were directly impacted by the gas used and the response time. Primarily, the function processes the large data size and involves high transaction fees and long response times. The gas used accounts for 9061 times of data length, while the response time accounts for 2.84 times of data length.

	abstract = {In the last decade, blockchain smart contracts emerged as an automated, decentralized, traceable, and immutable medium of value exchange. Nevertheless, existing blockchain smart contracts are not compatible with legal contracts. The automatic execution of a legal contract written in natural language is an open research question that can extend the blockchain ecosystem and inspire next-era business paradigms. In this paper, we propose an AI-assisted Smart Contract Generation (AIASCG) framework that allows contracting parties in heterogeneous contexts and different languages to collaboratively negotiate and draft the contract clauses. AIASCG provides a universal representation of contracts through the machine natural language (MNL) as the common understanding of the contract obligations. We compare the design of AIASCG with existing smart contract generation approaches to present its novelty. The main contribution of AIASCG is to address the issue in our previous proposed smart contract generation framework. For sentences written in natural language, existing framework requires editors to manually split sentences into words with semantic meaning. We propose an AI-based automatic word segmentation technique called Separation Inference (SpIn) to fulfill automatic split of the sentence. SpIn serves as the core component in AIASCG that accurately recommends the intermediate MNL outputs from a natural language sentence, tremendously reducing the manual effort in contract generation. SpIn is evaluated from a robustness and human satisfaction point of view to demonstrate its effectiveness. In the robustness evaluation, SpIn achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores and Recall of Out-of-Vocabulary (R_OOV) words on multiple word segmentation tasks. In addition, in the human evaluation, participants believe that 88.67% of sentences can be saved 80–100% of the time through automatic word segmentation. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Federated authentication, such as Google ID, enables users to conveniently access multiple websites using a single login credential. Despite this convenience, securing federated authentication services requires addressing a single point of failure, which can result from using a centralized authentication server. In addition, because the same login credentials are used, anonymity and protection against user impersonation attacks must be ensured. Recently, researchers introduced distributed authentication schemes based on blockchains and smart contracts (SCs) for systems that require high availability and reliability. Data on a blockchain are immutable, and deployed SCs cannot be changed or tampered with. Nonetheless, updates may be necessary to fix programming bugs or modify business logic. Recently, methods for updating SCs to address these issues have been investigated. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed and federated authentication scheme that uses SCs to overcome a single point of failure. Additionally, an updatable SC is designed to fix programming bugs, add to the function of an SC, or modify business logic. ProVerif, which is a widely known cryptographic protocol verification tool, confirms that the proposed scheme can provide protection against various security threats, such as single point of failure, user impersonation attacks, and user anonymity, which is vital in federated authentication services. In addition, the proposed scheme exhibits a performance improvement of 71% compared with other related schemes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the major concerns in any emergency relief operation is appropriate allocation of scarce emergency relief materials to the affected community. Due to several reasons ranging from lack of mechanism to accurately assess demand and utility of relief materials to malicious participation of some of the stakeholders, such allocation may become ad-hoc. Thus, it becomes imperative to have an unchallengeable and globally accessible record of relief requirement vis-à-vis allocation for efficient relief management. Emergency response organizations (e.g. UNICEF) have recommended the adoption of blockchain technology to create such immutable records. However, the usage of blockchain is restricted by the availability of end-to-end internet connection which may not be available in a post-disaster scenario. This paper proposes ReliefChain, a blockchain leveraged post disaster relief allocation system over delay tolerant network that works in such environments. We validate relief requirements to mitigate resource diversion, forecasting the exact demand and enumerating precise utilities of relief items. We design smart contracts for creating new transactions to upload relief requirements and allocations in the blockchain network. The proposed system executes these smart contracts to create an immutable and globally accessible record of relief requirement and allocation. Effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through extensive simulation in Ethereum platform. Results substantiate the efficiency of the system over a system using baseline methodologies, in terms of design parameters like shelter specific deficit and average resource deficit while not compromising the blockchain performance in terms of processing time and gas consumption even in presence of malicious forwarders. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A smart contract is a pivotal notion in blockchain technology. Distributed applications contain smart contracts verifying the fulfillment of the conditions, which determine the execution of transactions between the blockchain network nodes. Those software-controlled logical conditions are called verification rules. As the number of conditions increases, the complexity of smart contract testing rapidly grows. This paper aims to propose a smart contract testing pattern that significantly limits the needed number of test cases. For evaluation expression with four verification rules, the pattern usage reduces the number of test cases by 68.75% in relation to the full coverage of logical value combinations. With the increase in the number of logical conditions, not only the number of test cases but also their percentage decreases. Starting from seven verification rules in the evaluation expression, the percentage reduction of test cases exceeds 90%. As a result, the cost of preparing and maintaining test case suites may be substantially cut. It should be emphasized that test execution time can be reduced even by 3 orders of magnitude (from seconds to milliseconds). Such an approach is highly important for regression testing, especially when used in continuous software integration, delivery, and deployment approaches. © 2022 by the author.},

	abstract = {In modern society, the food supply chain management system has become an important research area realized nationally and internationally, which has established a collaborative relationship between producers, manufacturers, processors and retailers. Now, consumers are more interested in food quality, safety and the authentication of the products. Food safety has become an important issue in public health in the food market because people of all types and races around the world are affected due its poor quality. The traditional supply chains are centralized and face different issues such as lack of transparency, accountability and audit ability. The general issues in supply chain management include lack of communication, trust among the stakeholders, and interference of entities and wastage of food. A lot of work has been completed by researchers to address the above issues, but still, there is a need for effective mechanisms for the modeling of supply chain management systems. In this paper, a trusted, self-organized, traceable formal system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) is developed by using wireless sensors networks and finite automata. In the proposed model, smart contracts are designed to assure the automated payment procedures. The proposed model reduced the need for centralized authority. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to realize the requirements, and automata is used to capture behavior of the system. A blockchain-based model is used to provides the privacy and security mechanism for the transitions record. Wireless sensors are used to sense the information, and actors are used for decision making in case of any violation in the contact. A lot of work has been completed by researchers on smart contracts. Different smart contracts are designed to achieve the better traceability among producers, transporter/logistics and consumers. Our system provides the smart contract algorithm to show the interaction of entities in the food supply chain management system. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL) is used to describe the formal system and the VDM-SL toolbox is used for the validation and analysis of the system. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Owing to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, the aforementioned approach to transferring patient data to central servers creates serious security and privacy issues. In addition, blockchain distributed ledger technology has introduced immutable storage and decentralized data management capability, which handles a large number of distributed nodes of E-Healthcare transactions via a serverless network, but in a limited manner because of blockchain-enabled resources. In this scenario, the medical industries are concerned about constituting an innovation in health information preservation and exchanging service delivery protocols without the connectivity of an untrusted third-party infrastructure. In this study, we proposed a blockchain hyperledger fabric-enabled consortium architecture called BIoMT, which provides security, integrity, transparency, and provenance to health-related transactions and exchanges sensitive clinical information in a serverless peer-to-peer (P2P) secure network environment. A consensus is designed and created to reduce the rate of blockchain resource constraints on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The privacy of individual health transactions before sharing is protected using the NuCypher Re-Encryption mechanism, which increases security and provides medical ledger integrity and transparency. Smart contracts are created and deployed to automate device registration, exchange transactions, and ledger preservation in immutable storage (filecoin) after cross verification and validation. The experimental results show that the proposed BIoMT reduces the computational cost by 26.13%, and the robust medical node generation increases to 60.37%. Thus, only 31.79% and 74.21% of IoMT-related information and serverless P2P network usage are maintained and saved, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As more and more data is produced, finding a secure and efficient data access structure has become a major research issue. The centralized systems used by medical institutions for the management and transfer of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) can be vulnerable to security and privacy threats, often lack interoperability, and give patients limited or no access to their own EMRs. In this paper, we first propose a privilege-based data access structure and incorporates it into an attribute-based encryption mechanism to handle the management and sharing of big data sets. Our proposed privilege-based data access structure makes managing healthcare records using mobile healthcare devices efficient and feasible for large numbers of users. We then propose a novel distributed multilevel EMR (d-EMR) management scheme, which uses blockchain to address security concerns and enables selective sharing of medical records among staff members that belong to different levels of a hierarchical institution. We deploy smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain and utilize a distributed storage system to alleviate the dependence on the record-generating institutions to manage and share patient records. To preserve privacy of patient records, our smart contract is designed to allow patients to verify attributes prior to granting access rights. We provide extensive security, privacy, and evaluation analyses to show that our proposed scheme is both efficient and practical. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The ideas of the sharing economy have facilitated innovative business applications, such as Uber and Airbnb. As an example of a sharing economy application, ridesharing services take advantage of underutilized resources to create economic value. However, the unruly design of ridesharing systems may make urban traffic more congested and cause other technology-organization-environment issues. This study explores the application of blockchain and smart contract technologies to enhance ridesharing services by harvesting the blockchain benefits of transaction traceability, process transparency, system automation and disintermediation. After presenting system design and implementation details for building and deploying a blockchain-based system to support the reengineered ridesharing service with required business functions, we conduct functionality/performance tests and theory-based comparative analysis to confirm its feasibility and applicability. The results reveal that our system with blockchain-enabled benefits is superior to incumbent ridesharing systems. Moreover, while prior research rarely reports the design and implementation details of blockchain-based systems to support sharing economy services, this paper primarily contributes to extant literature by not only proposing a layered system architecture adapting blockchain and smart contracts into the desired ridesharing service but also demonstrating the design and implementation details, covering the development tools, the deployment environment and the deployed smart contracts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic further outlined the importance of global healthcare services provisioning for diagnosing and treating patients who tend to travel and live for large periods away from home and can be anywhere at any given time. Advances in technology enable healthcare practitioners to access critical data regarding a person’s health status to provide better services. Medical data are sensitive in nature, and therefore, a reliable mechanism should ensure that only authorized entities can access data when needed. This paper, through a layered consideration of a Globalized Healthcare Provisioning Ecosystem (GHPE), reveals the interdependencies among its major components and suggests a necessary abstraction to identify requirements for the design of an access control suitable for the ecosystem. These requirements are imposed by the nature of the medical data as well as by the newly introduced potentials of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. As a result, an attribute-based access control framework is proposed aiming to provide prompt and secure access to medical data globally by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies and standards, including Next-Generation Access Control (NGAC), blockchain and smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are proposed that enable access control to implement attribute and policy stores where policy classes and attributes are decentralized and immutable. In addition, the usage of blockchain-based distributed identities allows patients to be in control of access to their medical data and also enables healthcare service providers to access medical data promptly and reliably through the proposed access control framework. The qualitative characteristics of the proposed approach toward a decentralized and patient-centric access control in GHPE are demonstrated and discussed based on an application paradigm. © 2022 by the authors.},

Yet, simple FL frameworks (FLFs) naively assume an honest central server and altruistic client participation. In order to scale this new paradigm beyond small groups of already entrusted entities toward mass adoption, FLFs must be: 1) truly decentralized and 2) incentivized to participants. This systematic literature review is the first to analyze FLFs that holistically apply both, the blockchain technology to decentralize the process and reward mechanisms to incentivize participation. 422 publications were retrieved by querying 12 major scientific databases. After a systematic filtering process, 40 articles remained for an in-depth examination following our five research questions. To ensure the correctness of our findings, we verified the examination results with the respective authors. Although having the potential to direct the future of distributed and secure artificial intelligence, none of the analyzed FLFs is production ready. The approaches vary heavily in terms of use cases, system design, solved issues, and thoroughness. We provide a systematic approach to classify and quantify differences between FLFs, expose limitations of current works and derive future directions for research in this novel domain.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most of the world's countries are concerned with reducing harmful gas emissions. Some governments have made considerable attempts to address this problem. Saudi Arabia, for example, has taken significant steps to utilize renewable energy (RE) sources in addition to oil and gas. Consumers are encouraged to build small RE systems. These small grids will help people meet their daily electrical energy requirements. They can sell the excess to other customers. One of the major issues is managing the distribution and sale of RE. Blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can help overcome several obstacles to the implementation of a distributed RE management system (DREMS). However, several impediments may still stand in the way of its execution. Scalability and productivity are two of the most important considerations. The number of transactions made to the Blockchain network will increase in lockstep with the number of energy consumers. This will result in a significant lag in response. Understanding the renewable distributed energy system will aid in minimizing the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, this research identifies the RE systems installation approaches, and how Blockchain technology can be utilized. It provides the solution requirements of any DREMS. Moreover, it proposes a new Blockchain-based framework for DREMS. And designs selective protocols of the proposed framework. It provides a comparative analysis to assess the proposed protocols' ability to meet the identified requirements. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the current era, the skyrocketing demand for energy necessitates a powerful mechanism to mitigate the supply–demand gap in intelligent energy infrastructure, i.e., the smart grid. To handle this issue, an intelligent and secure energy management system (EMS) could benefit end-consumers participating in the Demand–Response (DR) program. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a real-time and secure incentive-based EMS for smart grid, i.e., RI-EMS approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and blockchain technology. In the RI-EMS approach, we proposed a novel reward mechanism for better convergence of the RL-based model using a Q-learning approach based on the greedy policy that guides the RL-agent for faster convergence. Then, the proposed RI-EMS approach designed a real-time incentive mechanism to minimize energy consumption in peak hours and reduce end-consumers’ energy bills to provide incentives to the end-consumers. Experimental results show that the proposed RI-EMS approach induces end-consumer participation and increases customer profitabilities compared to existing approaches considering the different performance evaluation metrics such as energy consumption for end-consumers, energy consumption reduction, and total cost comparison to end-consumers. Furthermore, blockchain-based results are simulated and analyzed with the help of deployed smart contracts in a Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the parameters such as transaction efficiency and data storage cost. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, little attention is given to a distributed smart fire brigade system as a PES to protect human life and properties from severe fire damage. The traditional PES are developed on a centralised system, which requires high computation and does not ensure timely service fulfilment. Furthermore, these traditional PESs suffer from a lack of trust, transparency, data integrity, and a single point of failure issue. In this context, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Secure and Trusted (BEST) framework for PES in the smart city environment. The BEST framework focuses on providing a fire brigade service as a PES to the smart home based on IoT device information to protect it from serious fire damage. Further, we used two edge computing servers, an IoT controller and a service controller. The IoT and service controller are used for local storage and to enhance the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfilments, respectively. The IoT controller manages an access control list to keep track of registered IoT gateways and their IoT devices, avoiding misguiding the PES department. The service controller utilised the queue model to handle the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. Further, various smart contracts are designed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform to automatically call a PES either in the presence or absence of the smart-home owner under uncertain environmental conditions. The performance evaluation of the proposed BEST framework indicates the benefits of utilising the distributed environment and the smart contract logic. The various simulation results are evaluated in terms of service queue length, utilisation, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, number of PES departments, number of PES providers, and end-to-end delay. These simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the BEST framework. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We propose N-choice game (NCG), a decentralized pseudo-random number generation method that can be executed on smart contracts. Of the M participants, one is a dealer, and the rest are players, each with a different role. Each participant randomly chooses one value between 0 and N - 1 and receives a score determined by the NCG rule. The amount of reward each participant receives is determined by the score. The values chosen by the participants are combined and hashed into a pseudo-random number. The NCG framework is designed to achieve the following three goals: (1) Incentivize participants to provide random choices, (2) Evaluate the level of randomness in the decentralized environment, and (3) Establish high performance. We implement the NCG framework in Solidity and evaluate its performance. Our extensive experiments revealed that unless more than 90% of NCG players collide, the generated random numbers have high randomness that can pass the NIST randomness test. The experiments also demonstrated that the throughput of random number generation in NCG was 129 times faster than in the existing framework, Random Bit Generator [2].  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {In order to have transactions executed and recorded on blockchains such as the Ethereum Mainnet, fees expressed in crypto-currency units of the blockchain must be paid. One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max–min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max–min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low transaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Malicious users can upload illegal data to the blockchain to spread it, resulting in serious threats due to the tamper-proof characteristics of the blockchain. However, the existing methods for uploading illegal data identification cannot select trust nodes and ensure the credibility of the identification results, leading to a decrease in the credibility of the methods. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trust model for uploading illegal data identification. The trust model mainly has the following two core modules: Reputation-based random selection algorithm (RBRSA) and incentive mechanism. By assigning reputation attributes to nodes, the proposed RBRSA will select nodes according to reputation values. RBRSA favors the nodes with high reputation value to ensure the randomness and credibility of the identification nodes. The incentive mechanism is designed to ensure the credibility of the identification results through the credibility analysis of the model based on game theory and Nash equilibrium. Identification nodes that identify illegal data correctly will obtain incentives. In order to obtain a higher income, the identification nodes must identify illegal data correctly. Credibility analysis and comparative experiments show that the probability of selecting credible nodes by RBRSA is up to 23% higher than the random selection algorithm. The probability of selecting the nodes with a reputation value of 20 by RBRSA is 27% lower than the random selection algorithm; that is, the probability that RBRSA selects untrusted nodes is lower. Therefore, the nodes selected by RBRSA have superior credibility compared with other methods. In terms of the effect of the incentive mechanism, the incentive mechanism can encourage nodes to identify data credibly and improve the credibility of identification results. All in all, the trusted model has higher credibility than other methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

Doing so is trivial if the mechanism is allowed to observe all actions taken in the game, as this allows it to simply punish those agents who deviate from the intended strategy. Instead, we consider an abstraction where the mechanism probabilistically infers information about the outcome of the game. We show that payment schemes can be used to implement any set of utilities if and only if the mechanism can essentially infer completely what happened. We show that finding an optimal payment scheme for games of perfect information is P-complete, and conjecture it to be PPAD-hard for games of imperfect information. We prove a lower bound on the size of the payments, showing that the payments must be linear in the intended level of security. We demonstrate the applicability of our model to concrete problems in distributed computing, namely decentralized commerce and secure multiparty computation, for which the payments match the lower bound asymptotically. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Cloud storage is an essential method for data storage. Verifying the integrity of data in the cloud is critical for the client. Traditional cloud storage approaches rely on third-party auditors (TPAs) to accomplish auditing tasks. However, third-party auditors are often not trusted. To eliminate over-reliance on third-party auditors, this paper designs a blockchain-based auditing scheme that uses blockchain instead of third-party auditors to ensure the reliability of data auditing. Meanwhile, our scheme is based on the audit method of the quad Merkle hash tree, using the root of the quad Merkle hash tree to verify the integrity of data, which significantly improves computing and storage efficiency. Automated verification of auditing activities by deploying smart contracts on the blockchain allows us to have a more up-to-date picture of data integrity. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through security analysis and experiments, which prove that the proposed scheme is secure and effective. Author},

	abstract = {The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has had a far-reaching impact on data privacy and compliance for cloud providers. GDPR influences access to, storage, processing and transmission of personal data, requiring these operations to be verified by a cloud user through explicit consent prior to execution. GDPR rules implemented for such operations can be ambiguous and often open to interpretation, making manual verification a time consuming and error prone process for cloud providers. An encoding of GDPR rules is described, with each operation carried out using these rules recorded into a Blockchain for auditing purposes. Specifically, this work shows how some GDPR rules can appear as opcodes in smart contracts to verify the operations of providers on user data in a transparent and automatic way. An abstract model is designed to demonstrate how cloud providers can access and deploy such smart contracts through a Blockchain-based virtual machine. A case study is used to demonstrate how this approach can be used in practice. The case study uses a collection of design patterns and smart contracts to verify provider operations, including read, write, execution and transfer on user data. Validation is undertaken by deploying the smart contracts in a Blockchain test network to investigate the execution costs of GDPR compliance checking. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

The cost of deploying a blockchain system in a real environment to conduct research on security issues is relatively high, and the related security analysis and verification are also destructive and irreproducible. Therefore, based on the idea of layered design, this paper proposes a blockchain system simulation platform. The blockchain system is divided into four layers in the simulation platform: the consensus layer, network layer, contract layer, and storage layer. In the consensus layer, the problem of computing resource waste is solved. In the network layer, a peer-to-peer network topology simulation is implemented. In the storage layer, the problem of redundant storage is solved. In the contract layer, the contract replay speed is accelerated. Finally, a prototype of an efficient blockchain simulation system is implemented based on the above methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {It is widely expected that future networks of 6G and beyond will substantially improve on 5G. Technologies such as Internet of Skills and Industry 4.0 will become stable and viable, as a direct consequence of networks that offer sustained and reliable mobile performance levels. The primary challenges for future technologies are not just low-latency and high-bandwidth. The more critical problem Mobile Service Providers (MSPs) will face will be in balancing the inflated demands of network connections and customers' trust in the network service. That is, being able to interconnect billions of unique devices while adhering to the agreed terms of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To meet these targets, it is self-evident that MSPs cannot operate in a solitary environment. They must enable cooperation among themselves in a manner that ensures trust, both between themselves as well as with customers. In this study, we present the BEAT (Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and Transparent) Infrastructure Sharing architecture. BEAT exploits the inherent properties of permissioned type of distributed ledger technology (i.e., permissioned distributed ledgers) to deliver on accountability and transparency metrics whenever infrastructure needs to be shared between providers. We also propose a lightweight method that enables device-level accountability. BEAT has been designed to be deployable directly as only minor software upgrades to network devices such as routers. Our simulations on a resource-limited device show that BEAT adds only a few seconds of overhead processing time - with the latest state-of-the-art network devices, we can reasonably anticipate much lower overheads.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs running on the blockchain. They are immutable and cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. Therefore, ensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them to the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them into five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with seriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract being controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a symbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects that can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts' bytecode. We verify the performance of DefectChecker by applying it to an open-source dataset. Our evaluation results show that DefectChecker obtains a high F-score (88.8 percent in the whole dataset) and only requires 0.15s to analyze one smart contract on average. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart contracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact level 1-3, including some real-world attacks.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a result of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several proposals of blockchain-based solutions for digital COVID-19 certificates have been presented. Considering that health data have high privacy requirements, a health data management system must fulfil several strict privacy and security requirements. On the one hand, confidentiality of the medical data must be assured, being the data owner (the patient) the actor that maintain control over the privacy of their certificates. On the other hand, the entities involved in the generation and validation of certificates must be supervised by a regulatory authority. This set of requirements are generally not achieved together in previous proposals. Moreover, it is required that a digital COVID-19 certificate management protocol provides an easy verification process and also strongly avoid the risk of forgery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a protocol to manage digital COVID-19 certificates where individual users decide how to share their private data in a hierarchical system. In order to achieve this, we put together two different technologies: the use of a proxy re-encryption (PRE) service in conjunction with a blockchain-based protocol. Additionally, our protocol introduces an authority to control and regulate the centers that can generate digital COVID-19 certificates and offers two kinds of validation of certificates for registered and non-registered verification entities. Therefore, the paper achieves all the requirements, that is, data sovereignty, high privacy, forgery avoidance, regulation of entities, security and easy verification. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The vast enhancement in the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is due to the impact of the distributed emerging technology and topology of the industrial IoV. It has created a new paradigm, such as the security-related resource constraints of Industry 5.0. A new revolution and dimension in the IoV popup raise various critical challenges in the existing information preservation, especially in node transactions and communication, transmission, trust and privacy, and security-protection-related problems, which have been analyzed. These aspects pose serious problems for the industry to provide vehicular-related data integrity, availability, information exchange reliability, provenance, and trustworthiness for the overall activities and service delivery prospects against the increasing number of multiple transactions. In addition, there has been a lot of research interest that intersects with blockchain and Internet of Vehicles association. In this regard, the inadequate performance of the Internet of Vehicles and connected nodes and the high resource requirements of the consortium blockchain ledger have not yet been tackled with a complete solution. The introduction of the NuCypher Re-encryption infrastructure, hashing tree and allocation, and blockchain proof-of-work require more computational power as well. This paper contributes in two different folds. First, it proposes a blockchain sawtooth-enabled modular architecture for protected, secure, and trusted execution, service delivery, and acknowledgment with immutable ledger storage and security and peer-to-peer (P2P) network on-chain and off-chain inter-communication for vehicular activities. Secondly, we design and create a smart contract-enabled data structure in order to provide smooth industrial node streamlined transactions and broadcast content. Substantially, we develop and deploy a hyperledger sawtooth-aware customized consensus for multiple proof-of-work investigations. For validation purposes, we simulate the exchange of information and related details between connected devices on the IoV. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture of BIoV reduces the cost of computational power down to 37.21% and the robust node generation and exchange up to 56.33%. Therefore, only 41.93% and 47.31% of the Internet of Vehicles-related resources and network constraints are kept and used, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The subscription economy was born because the relationship between creators and customers is different than it used to be. The era of the creator economy seems to be filled with boundless promise, but at the end of the day, creators are just slaves to tech giants. Neither the control of the content created, nor the money made in their pockets is in complete control of the creator. The blockchain can completely solve these injustices monopolized by enterprises. In the blockchain era, all kinds of creations from music, and video-to-text can be turned into assets that can be purchased and traded through smart contracts. In the music industry, for example, creators do not need to share profits with streaming platforms and record labels and get all the benefits directly. In addition, when the content created is on the chain, every transaction will be recorded on the blockchain, and everyone can inquire about it, avoiding opacity or causing disputes in the future. However, with the structure of the standard blockchain, as long as the registration is successful, each role in the chain will have permanent data access rights, and the flexibility of access control is poor. Therefore, this study proposes a digital media subscription mechanism based on the Hyperledger blockchain architecture combined with proxy re-encryption. We use symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, smart contracts, and algorithms to design our protocol. When the licensee violates the agreement with the creator, the creator can revoke the access rights to the digital media of the licensee at any time, to realize more secure and convenient digital media transmission. The proposed scheme meets various security requirements of blockchain architecture, and we have also applied the BAN logic proof model to evaluate the correctness of the proposed scheme. This study also proposes an arbitration mechanism when the dispute occurs, and performed well in terms of communication and computational costs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising decentralized deep learning technology, which allows users to update models cooperatively without sharing their data. FL is reshaping existing industry paradigms for mathematical modeling and analysis, enabling an increasing number of industries to build privacy-preserving, secure distributed machine learning models. However, the inherent characteristics of FL have led to problems such as privacy protection, communication cost, systems heterogeneity, and unreliability model upload in actual operation. Interestingly, the integration with Blockchain technology provides an opportunity to further improve the FL security and performance, besides increasing its scope of applications. Therefore, we denote this integration of Blockchain and FL as the Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) framework. This paper introduces an in-depth survey of BCFL and discusses the insights of such a new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce the FL technology and discuss the challenges faced by such technology. Then, we summarize the Blockchain ecosystem. Next, we highlight the structural design and platform of BCFL. Furthermore, we present the attempts ins improving FL performance with Blockchain and several combined applications of incentive mechanisms in FL. Finally, we summarize the industrial application scenarios of BCFL. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A smart contract is a computer program which is automatically executed with some conditional statements such as 'if/then'. Since smart contracts can include some vulnerable program codes, smart contract exploit was recently highlighted as one of the severe threats to Ethereum blockchain. As one of the efficient and effective smart contract vulnerability detection methods, deep learning methods have been studied due to the fast detection speed and the high detection accuracy. Recently, the deep learning methods using convolutional neural network(CNN) have actively studied to classify images transformed from smart contracts into vulnerable or invulnerable. However, while simply transforming a smart contract into an image and analyzing, semantics and context of the smart contract are ignored to cause false detection alarms. To detect vulnerable smart contracts while maintaining their semantics and context, we propose a new code-targeted CNN architecture, called CodeNet. To improve the performance of CodeNet, we also design a data pre-processing procedure, where a smart contract is transformed into an image while maintaining locality. From the experimental results under various types of vulnerabilities, the proposed CodeNet-based vulnerability detection method shows the good-enough detection performance and detection time compared to well-known state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tools.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Based on the above status quo, a blockchain-based secure e-commerce system is researched and implemented. Using the distributed architecture of the blockchain system and the automatic execution feature of smart contracts, a secure transaction application system is designed to realize decentralization and solve the problem of untrustworthy intermediate parties. Data storage is based on the mechanism of combining blockchain and offchain databases to ensure data security, and the characteristic of blockchain can only be appended and read to prevent the system from being tampered. The database index and the storage structure of smart contract commodity information and transaction information are established to improve the query efficiency. The functional and performance tests of the system show that the transaction processing efficiency is high in the multinode environment, and the response time of order and commodity status query can reach 80 ms. The design and development process of the system is introduced in detail, which is an important reference value for the application of blockchain technology in e-commerce. © 2022 Yishuang Cheng and Juan Pan.},

	abstract = {Access control is essential for the IoT environment to ensure that only approved and trusted parties are able to configure devices, access sensor information, and command actuators to execute activities. The IoT ecosystem is subject to various access control complications due to the limited latency between IoT devices and the Internet, low energy requirements of IoT devices, the distributed framework, ad-hoc networks, and an exceptionally large number of heterogeneous IoT devices that need to be managed. The motivation for this proposed work is to resolve the incurring challenges of IoT associated with management and access control security. Each IoT domain implementation has particular features and needs separate access control policies to be considered in order to design a secure solution. This research work aims to resolve the intricacy of policies management, forged policies, dissemination, tracking of access control policies, automation, and central management of IoT nodes and provides a trackable and auditable access control policy management system that prevents forged policy dissemination by applying Software Defined Network (SDN) and blockchain technology in an IoT environment. Integration of SDN and blockchain provides a robust solution for IoT environment security. Recently, smart contracts have become one of blockchain technology's most promising applications. The integration of smart contracts with blockchain technology provides the capability of designing tamper-proof and independently verifiable policies. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable solution for implementing immutable, verifiable, adaptive, and automated access control policies for IoT devices together with a successful proof of concept that demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of throughput and resource access delay between the blockchain component and the controller as well as from node to node. The number of nodes in the IoT network and the number of resource access requests were independently and systematically increased during the evaluations. The results illustrate that the resource access delay and throughput were affected neither linearly nor exponentially; hence, the proposed solution shows no significant degradation in performance with an increase in the number of nodes and/or requests. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Provable data possession (PDP) is a crucial means of protecting the integrity of data in the domain of cloud storage. In the post-quantum era, the PDP scheme that uses lattices relies too heavily on the third-party auditor (TPA), which is not entirely trustworthy and is easily affected by a single point of failure. Moreover, the scheme often leads to the leakage of private user data while attempting to satisfy the demand for public verification. In response to the above problems, this paper designs a protocol for post-quantum privacy-preserving PDP and uses it to develop a scheme based on smart contracts. The proposed scheme has the characteristics of being post quantum and can satisfy the demand for public verification while preserving user privacy. The property of noninteraction of the protocol can reduce transaction fees incurred owing to the frequent operation of the blockchain, and the smart contract with a deposit mechanism can ensure fair payments to all parties. The results of a theoretical analysis and experiments show that the proposed scheme is highly secure and efficient.  © 2023 Zhengwen Li et al.},

	abstract = {Many blockchain applications exchange tokens, such as bitcoin and ether, or implement them through smart contracts. A trend in blockchain is to apply standards for token interoperability, unchanged, from platform to platform, easing the design challenges with trusted and widely-used specifications. However, the exploitation of the target language semantics can result in technological advantages and more efficient contracts. This paper presents a re-engineering of OpenZeppelin’s implementation of the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards in Takamaka, a Java framework for programming smart contracts. It describes a sound solution to the issue about the types allowed for the token holders and a novel implementation for making snapshots of tokens, based on tree maps, that is possible in Java, but not in Solidity, more efficient than the literal translation in Java from Solidity, within the Java virtual machine. Moreover, it applies to ERC-721 as well, where a snapshot mechanism was previously missing. The same snapshot mechanism can also be applied beyond the smart contracts for tokens. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the popularity of e-commerce grows, an electronic coupon (e-coupon) is widely used due to its convenience and portability. In most e-coupon services, the information of e-coupons is managed on a centralized server. However, e-coupon services are often vulnerable to security issues because of centralization. For example, when the e-coupon information which is stored in a centralized e-coupon server is forged, it becomes difficult to match the user and the e-coupon's owner, and an expired e-coupon can be used repetitively (i.e., double-spending). To handle this issue, we propose a new e-coupon service by exploiting a blockchain system to improve the security of the service. To do this, we first design a server to enable the e-coupon service and communicate with the blockchain system. Second, we devise a smart contract on the blockchain system to provide integrity of the e-coupon business logic and the e-coupon's information. We implemented the proposed service on an Ethereum-based blockchain system. The experimental results show that our proposed service improves higher security with a minor performance overhead compared with an existing e-coupon service.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Food supply chains are highly distributed, collaborative, heterogeneous, diverse, and varied by product, process, and destination. The global food supply chain (FSC) objective is to maintain a good balance between supply and demand and move products from producer to market. However, sustainability of the FSC has become a major concern as limited resources and increasing population pressure threaten its existence. Supply chain management is an important issue for FSC due to information flow throughout the supply chain. Industry-specific characteristics and extensive integration among multiple actors in an entire supply chain exacerbate this situation. The agri-food sector has one of the lowest rates of information technology penetration for innovation. Over the past thirty years, information and communication technology (ICT) has been introduced into the agricultural and food sectors, helping to improve food production and transportation. However, there are various challenges, such as transparency, accountability, food scandal, trust, and inefficient information flow, that the food supply chain is still facing in reaching sustainable goals. The complexity of food supply systems and the opportunities and challenges faced regarding desired sustainability performance need to be examined to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Blockchain is an emerging and disruptive digital technology that can transform governance and sustainability in integrated food supply chains. It provides a transparent, immutable, and traceable ledger that minimizes anomalies and information fraud, making it a potential solution for designing a transparent, traceable food system. Blockchain can potentially improve the sustainability of the food supply chain by providing a transparent traceability system. Food traceability is important for managing the food supply chain and protecting public health. It allows quick and accurate traceability of contaminated food that causes foodborne illness outbreaks, leading to the withdrawal of contaminated food from markets. Blockchain can achieve traceability, provenance tracking, transparency, and reduce environmental impact in the food supply chain. It also helps in achieving sustainable development goals set by the UN. However, there is no scientific research on blockchain’s contribution to achieving these goals in the food supply chain. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review and thematic analysis to study the relationship between FSC sustainability, blockchain, and sustainable development goals. © 2023 by the authors.},

In order to solve the issue that the Hyperledger Fabric does not currently support Chinese Commercial Cryptographic (CCC) algorithms, we extended the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP) module in the Hyperledger Fabric by upgrading the original BCCSP module to support the CCC algorithms SM2 and SM3. Furthermore, we designed a transaction process by using UBCCSP (Upgraded BCCSP), and a new smart contract also has been presented. After that, an improved consortium blockchain information system based on UBCCSP named UCBIS (Consortium Blockchain Information System based on UBCCSP) is proposed. In the Hyperledger Fabric transaction process, the identity information and transaction data are protected by the SM2 and SM3 algorithms, moreover, SM3 is also used in the construction process of smart contracts. Our smart contracts reduce the total data amount and improve query efficiency. Finally, the information query system based on UBCCSP is implemented. After being tested and analyzed, the average time for every query is only 31.162 ms in the blockchain system, which has better performance and higher query efficiency. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM). © 2022 The Authors},

More specifically, when verifiable transactions between untrusted parties are concerned in a safe and reliable environment, its peculiar decentralized and tamper-proof structure makes it suitable for a vast class of business domains, such as Cloud Manufacturing, which is a new paradigm in the industry based on cloud technologies. However, the stiffness of existing solutions, that are unable to provide and implement heterogeneous services in a Cloud environment, emphasizes the need of a standard framework to overcome this limit and improve collaboration. Firstly, this paper introduces a Blockchain based platform designed with Smart Contracts for improving digital processes in a manufacturing environment. The primary contribution is the integration of two popular cloud technologies within the Blockchain: Docker, a scalable platform to run applications in lightweight environments, and Cloud Storage. Each process available in the platform requires input files and produces output files by using cloud storage as a repository and it is delivered by the owner as a self-contained Docker image, whose digest is safely stored in the chain. Secondly, with the purpose of selecting the fastest node for each new process instance required by consumers, we introduce a task assignment problem based on a deep learning approach and past metrics. The proposed platform is applied to a real-world industrial case study regarding ophthalmic lenses manufacturing and the optimization of lens surface calculation.  © 2022 IEEE.},

We design a GRU network with attention mechanism learning from the N-gram bytecode patterns to determine whether a smart contract is fraudulent or not. Our framework is advantageous over the baseline algorithms in three aspects. Firstly, SCSGuard provides a unified solution to different scam genres, thus relieving the need for code analysis skills. Secondly, the inference of SCSGuard is faster than the code analysis by several orders of magnitudes. Thirdly, experimental results manifest that SCSGuard achieves high accuracy (0.920.94), precision (0.940.96) and recall (0.970.98) for both Ponzi and Honeypot scams under similar settings, and is potentially useful to detect new Phishing smart contracts. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The key target of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is to interrupt and suspend any available online services either executed for professional or personal gains. These attacks originate from the fast advancement in the number of insecure technologies. The attacks are caused due to the easy access to internet and advent of technology resulting to exponential growth of traffic volumes. DDoS attack remains most leading security risks to provisioning services. Also, the current embraced security mechanism for defense lacks flexibility and adequate resources to combat these attacks. Hence, there is need to embrace various other critical resources, where they can share the problem of mitigation. In addition, emerging technologies for instance smart contracts and blockchain offers for the sharing of these potential attacks information in an entirely automated and distributed manner. This paper recommends for a blockchain design which combines smart contracts and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, by presenting new ideal opportunities towards efficient DDoS mitigation solutions in variety of cooperative domains. Furthermore, the key advantage and benefits of this structure is deployment of still existing distributed and public infrastructure to blacklisted IP address or even advertise white, and the application of such an infrastructure with further defense mechanisms to current attacks of DDoS, deprived of considering distribution mechanisms or specialized registries, which facilitates the implementation of procedures across diverse domains. This paper further presents the demonstration and implementation features of this blockchain structure, discussion and study findings over these smart contracts and ML technologies. The study further concludes by recommending use of smart contract in collaborative block-chain design with ML for mitigating future attack of DDoS. © 2022 Slovene Society Informatika.

	abstract = {Securing and managing medical data in hospitals is one of the significant challenges still existing in healthcare. There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {With the rapid enhancement in the design and development of the Internet of Things creates a new research interest in the adaptation in industrial domains. It is due to the impact of distributed emerging technology and topology of industrial Internet of Things and the security-related resource constraints of industrial 5.0. This conducts new paradigm along with critical challenges to the existing information preservation, node transactions and communication, transmission, trust and privacy, and security protection related problems. These critical aspects pose serious limitations and issues for the industry to provide industrial data integrity, information exchange reliability, provenance, and trustworthiness for the overall activities and service delivery prospects. In addition, the intersection of blockchain and industrial IoT has gained more consideration and research interest. However, there is an emerging limitation between the inadequate performance of industrial IoT and connected nodes, and the high resource requirement of permissioned private blockchain ledger has not yet been tackled with the complete solution. Due to the introductions of NuCypher Re-Encryption infrastructure, hashing tree and allocation, and deployment of blockchain proof-of-work required more computational power as well. This paper is divided into three different folds; first, we studied various related literature of blockchain-enabling industrial Internet of Things and its critical implementation challenging aspects along with the solution. Secondly, we proposed a blockchain hyperledger sawtooth-enabled framework. This framework provides a secure and trusted execution environment, in which service delivery mechanisms and protocols are designed with an acknowledgment, including the immutable ledger storage security, along with the peer-to-peer network on-chain and off-chain communication of industrial activities. Thirdly, we design pseudo-chain codes and consensus protocols to provide smooth industrial node streamline transactions and broadcast content. The proposed multiple proof-of-work investigated and simulated using Hyperledger Sawtooth-enabled docker for testing to exchange information between connected devices of industrial Internet of Things within the limited usage of resource constraints.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {How to achieve secure content distribution and accountability in information-centric networking (ICN) is a crucial problem. Subscribers need to verify whether the data came from a reliable source, rather than from a spoofing adversary. Public key cryptography was introduced to achieve a method of authentication that binds the data packet to its owner. In existing prototypes, PKIs, identity-based signatures (IBSs) and recommendation networks are the common schemes used to ensure the authenticity and availability of public keys. However, CA-based PKIs and KGC-based IBSs have been proven to be weak when it comes to resisting security attacks, with recommendation networks being too complex to deploy. In this respect, we designed a novel distributed authentication model as a secure scheme to support public key cryptography. Our model establishes a decentralized public key infrastructure by combining the smart contracts of blockchain and optimized zero-knowledge proof-verifiable presentations by utilizing the DID project, which realizes the management of public key certificates through blockchain and ensures the authenticity and availability of public keys in decentralized infrastructure. Our scheme fundamentally solves the issues of security and feasibility in existing schemes and provides a more scalable solution with respect to authenticating data sources. An experiment demonstrated that our proposal is 20% faster than the original zero knowledge proof scheme in registration. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, existing blockchain-based solutions are expensive, nonoptimized, and lack spectrum fraud detection. This article proposes a novel consensus mechanism for a blockchain-based dynamic spectrum access (DSA) system. The proposed 'Proof-of-Sense' consensus mechanism operates based on spectrum sensing procedures rather than cryptographic calculations. It is specially designed to address fraudulent/unauthorized access to the spectrum by analyzing the sensed spectrum data. The core of the consensus mechanism is a cryptographic key sharing mechanism inspired by Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Moreover, the proposed DSA system can enable different microservices, such as automated spectrum auctions, payment and penalty handling, and spectrum fraud detection. A proof of concept based on experimental approaches coupled with Matlab simulations is presented to analyze the performance of the proposed consensus mechanism.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Blockchain can effectively solve the problems of security and trust in FinTech. This paper will explore the expression method of trust index in blockchain, and build based on blockchain a multi-dimensional trust index system and evaluation mechanism (MDTEM) for FinTech. Firstly, a four-level blockchain structure has been built, including cloud level blockchain, Internet level blockchain, contract level blockchain and application level blockchain in the FinTech ecological environment to ensure the security, reliability and trustworthiness of financial services. Secondly, according to the trust structure of blockchain on FinTech payment behavior, the index system and evaluation mechanism of direct trust, indirect trust, recommendation trust and feedback trust of FinTech based on blockchain are designed. Finally, the trust simulation experiment of FinTech mechanism is carried out from three aspects: data sending, data transmission, data reception and delivery success rate. Simulation results show that the proposed MDTEM trust mechanism can better improve the safe and reliable application of FinTech trust mechanism.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) opens up a challenging research area towards improving secure data sharing which currently has several limitations. Primarily, the lack of inbuilt guarantees of honest behavior of participating, such as end-users or cloud behaving maliciously may result in disputes. Given such challenges, we propose a fair, accountable, and secure data sharing scheme, FairShare for IIoT. In this scheme, data collected from IoT devices are processed and stored in cloud servers with intermediate fog nodes facilitating computation. Authorized clients can access this data against some fee to make strategic decisions for improving the operational services of the IIoT system. By enabling blockchain, FairShare prevents fraudulent activities and thereby achieves fairness such that each party gets their rightful outcome in terms of data or penalty/rewards while simultaneously ensuring accountability of the services provided by the parties. Additionally, smart contracts are designed to act as a mediator during any dispute by enforcing payment settlement. Further, security and privacy of data are ensured by suitably applying cryptographic techniques like proxy re-encryption. We prove FairShare to be secure as long as at least one of the parties is honest. We validate FairShare with a theoretical overhead analysis. We also build a prototype in Ethereum to estimate performance and justify comparable results with a state-of-the-art scheme both via simulation and a realistic testbed setup. We observe an additional communication overhead of 256 bytes and a cost of deployment of 1.01 USD in Ethereum which are constant irrespective of file size. IEEE},

	abstract = {n recent years it has been shown that the secure exchange of medical information significantly benefits people's life quality, improving their care and treatment. The interoperability of the entire healthcare ecosystem is a constant challenge, and even more, with all the risks posed to the security of healthcare information. Blockchain technology is emerging as one of the main alternatives when it comes to finding a balance in the healthcare ecosystem. However, the constant development of new Blockchain technologies and the evolution of healthcare systems make it difficult to find established proposals. From an architectural point of view, the design of blockchain-based solutions requires trade-offs e.g., security and interoperability. This paper focuses on two main objectives, in the first one, it was carried out a Systematic Literature Review for exploring architectural mechanisms used to support the interoperability and security of Blockchain-based Health Management Systems. Taking into account of results, a series of scenarios were generated where these mechanisms can be used along with their context, issues, and various architectural concerns (interoperability and security). In the second objective, a high-level architecture and its validation were proposed through an experiment for the whole process of developing a Domain Specific Language, using the Model Driven Engineering methodology for specific Smart Contracts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides a feasible solution to data outsourcing, and hence forming a cloud-based data market, where data users buy data from owners through querying cloud servers. However, it also incurs new privacy and security problems, as data is under a centralized third-party instead of the data owner's direct control. Existing data markets are also questioned on their inflexible and opaque pricing, where the value of data ownership and the cost of query searches are mixed. In this paper, we consider blockchain-based storage as a better choice to ensure safe data outsourcing since data is spread out across many data points. We propose an Ethereum-based data market that provides distributed storage and correct remote data search. We design a new pricing model, where each query will be charged by two parties: owner (paid for providing his data) and miner (rewarded by performing query searches). We study a new cooperative search scheme through a proxy to reduce cost on the user side. Given that each user query is charged based on its number of keywords, then a cooperative search can reduce user-side cost by combining multiple queries into a group so that overlapped keywords will only be charged for one time. To ensure user QoE, a combined query should not be significantly larger than any of its original queries in terms of the number of keywords. The total price is based on the total number of keywords in all groups. Since it is a cooperative model with shared resources, we also study various incentive properties on the user side, yielding a cost sharing mechanism to split joint cost in a truth-revealing and fair manner. We further extend our market with a set of substitute data owners and propose a double auction mechanism to match users and owners based on their requirements. Experiments have been conducted on real query trace to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

According to statistics, a major portion of today’s traffic difficulties are caused by accidents caused by subpar cars and auto parts. As a result, each country has, over time, enacted equivalent rules and regulations to prevent such tragedies. However, in the face of profit, some people are desperate enough to employ illegal parts and illegally modified cars, and auto fraud is rampant. As a result, we employ the blockchain of the symmetrical Blockchain’s digital ledger and smart contract technology to build a decentralized supply chain system that can identify specific parts. In this study, we design and discuss the proposed system framework by user functions and the flow of parts based on blockchain, and we discuss communication protocols that use the symmetry and asymmetry cryptography, algorithms, properties, and security of the mechanism while providing related analysis and comparing the properties and costs of the system with other studies.

	abstract = {Purpose: The recent development in logistics due to the dawn of Logistics 4.0 has made global logistics providers more dependent on intelligent technologies. In this era, these technologies assist in data collection and transmission of logistical data and pose many security and privacy threats in logistics management systems. The customer’s private information, which is shared among the logistics stakeholders for optimal operation, faces unauthorized access due to a lack of privacy. This, amongst others, is a critical problem that needs to be addressed with blockchain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is transforming different sectors, and it has the potential to provide a solution to the issues mentioned above, with its unique features such as immutability, transparency, and anonymity. Method: This study designed a blockchain-based logistics management architecture on a decentralized peer-2-peer network using Ethereum smart contracts. The proposed system deployed the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) asymmetric encryption method to protect the logistics system from cyber-attacks and secure customers’ private information from unauthorized access. Findings: Furthermore, the security and privacy of the proposed system are evaluated based on the theorem. The proof shows that the system can provide security to the logistics system and privacy to customers’ private data. The performance evaluation is based on throughput and latency. It shows that the proposed system is better than the baseline system, and the comparatives analysis shows that the proposed system is more secure and efficient than the existing systems. Implication and Limitation: The proposed system offers a better solution to the security/privacy of the logistics management system and provides recommendations to key stakeholders involved in the logistics industry while adopting blockchain technology. Apart from the study’s methodological limitation, it is also limited by a lack of reference materials. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {For the development of blockchain smart contracts, a structured approach based on the principles of the Model Driven Architecture can be beneficial and facilitate the implementation of smart contracts. This paper presents such an approach, which, in combination with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and State machine diagrams, allows the smart contract structure and behavior logic to be modeled in several abstraction layers. This paper delves into details on how the model-to-model transformations from the specified Blockchain Platform Independent Model (PIM) with specified state-like behavior can be used to produce a Solidity Platform Specific Model (PSM). Subsequently, we elaborate on how the Solidity PSM is used for Solidity smart contract code generation by employing model-to-text transformations. The paper also demonstrates the process of our proposed transformations and code generation using smart contract code examples from Solidity documentation. Based on the examples, a Blockchain PIM is specified and transformed to Solidity PSM, which is then used for Solidity smart contract code generation. The generated smart contract code is then compiled, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain JavaScript virtual machine, and compared to the original smart contract code in terms of Solidity code metrics, similarity scores, and execution costs. The evaluation results indicate that our approach could be successfully used to model and later generate smart contract code.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the business barriers that influence cost of implementing unmanned aerial system (UAS) and its suitability for a decentralised system. UAS, or drone, plays a role of data provider to architectural, engineering and construction professionals within a decentralised system. However, the expectations in the execution and test of the effectiveness of the UAS is often not met. The reasons for these fails are not well elaborated in the literature. Hence, the study investigates the barriers and cost analysis of UAS that can be used for a decentralised case, in which the UAS data are useful for multiple stakeholders, and provide illustration of the interactions within this approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is part of a longitudinal project by using a qualitative method of interviewing 24 participants involved in the process of application of drones in the country of the Dominican Republic. The open-ended semi-structured interviews were composed for questions regarding the application of UAS, barriers and business implications. The data gathered were transcribed and used thematic analysis for its interpretation. Later, conclusions of the barriers of UAS implementation in the organisation were analysed and a cost model was developed to identify a viable scenario. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the barriers and economic considerations faced in the implementation process of UAS. In this research, 16 barriers in the implementation process at the management level, 8 types of cases of business relationships and 13 business models were identified. Furthermore, recommendations were made about being the accountability of the dimensions and recurrent visits to the projects handled by the portfolio of the organisations. Research limitations/implications: Blockchain system is supported by UAS data and its tests require skills and resources that were outside of the scope of the main research intend regarding UAS implementation in construction. Furthermore, as these technologies are still under development, the assessment of the decentralised system, smart contract and swarm technology was addressed conceptually and further research are encouraged in this field. Practical implications: The paper includes barriers to consider before implementation, business implications, project examples and cost structure developed. Furthermore, the findings are fit theoretically into the context of a decentralised system. It was understood and contemplated that monitoring in open and outdoor spaces is the suitable approach for UAS implementations for decentralised system. The trend of decentralised autonomous organisations for transparency and efficiency of human tasks provides the foundations of human–robot interactions as well as the role of tokenisation of assets into the cyberspace. Therefore, the paper brings managers and technicians the implications for the future-proofing the implementation of UAS. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of the implications of cost and the suitable scenarios for return of investment in the UAS implementation in the current stage of the technology development. In addition, the paper makes reference to decentralised systems, smart contracts and swarm technology as options in which reality capture technologies are essential for construction projects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Due to the distributed and non-integrated nature of the healthcare systems which results from the application-centric view it leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data exchange (heterogeneity problem). On the other hand, Blockchain technologies are emerging as promising and cost-effective means to meet some of these requirements due to their inherent design properties, such as secure cryptography and a resilient peer-to-peer network. Likewise, Blockchain-based applications can benefit the healthcare domain via their properties of asset sharing, and audit trails of data access. Existing work mainly pays attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But it doesn't realize the increase need for better data interoperability amount multiple healthcare systems and services. This requires shifting from the application-centric solutions toward the patient-centric solutions. This paper presents A secure and efficient framework based on Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT named Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH) for better healthcare systems interoperability. A tiered-based architecture (5 tiers) with collaboration is designed for the feasible realization of PCH. Also, the design and implementation aspects start from the layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture that emphasizes the detailed component topology and interactions within the framework. An electronic medical record is used to show how healthcare data is processed with the required security considerations. Then, an evaluation of PCH against the existing Blockchain-based healthcare frameworks is conducted. The results analysis demonstrates that PCH offers practical solutions to protect healthcare data and support efficient data sharing with better interoperability.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security of random numbers. This paper improves the random number generator and designs a secure random number generator based on blockchain (BCsRNG). In practice, an encapsulated function algorithm of the secure random number is developed with the smart contract. Moreover, an API is provided to facilitate input and output.

	abstract = {Blockchain is a new and modern technology that is gradually being used in various fields due to its ability to decentralize and organize secure and reliable data exchange and storage. One of the related research areas generating increasing interest is the field of education, with particular focus on the digitization and automation of educational management processes and the ability to store and verify digital documents about student progress. The main goal of this study is to develop a platform that creates a unified digital register of students’ educational achievements, which is one of the most pressing issues in the field of education, based on the Ethereum blockchain architecture. Blockchain is expensive; therefore, there is a need to consider performance criteria when evaluating any decision made about the technology, especially the most important aspects such as predicting traffic behavior, estimating transaction costs and providing the necessary indicators of system quality and functionality. However, most research ignores the evaluation of performance indicators, such as throughput, the speed of transactions and the amount of data stored in the Ethereum blockchain database, which are the main evaluation criteria. This paper aims to eliminate this gap by evaluating the performance of the developed platform and by discussing the obtained experimental results. Thus, the main results of this work are the design and deployment of a blockchain platform and the analysis of its transaction costs. We conclude that the proposed blockchain solution is applicable as a system for the accounting and verification of loans and student academic achievements. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business processes can be seen as smart contracts, as they are oftentimes adopted to express agreements among different organizations. Indeed, they provide mechanisms to formalize the obligations of each involved party. For instance, collaborative business processes can specify when a certain task should be executed, under which conditions a service should be offered to the other participants, and how physical objects and information should be manipulated. In this setting, to prevent misuse of smart contracts and services and information provided, it is paramount to guarantee by design that security requirements are fulfilled. With the rise in popularity of blockchains, several approaches exploiting the trusted smart contract execution environment offered by this technology to enforce collaborative business processes have been proposed. Yet, the complexity of business processes, security requirements, and blockchain applications calls for an engineering approach that guides the design of secure business processes. Such an approach should both take advantage of the possibilities offered by blockchain technology to enforce some security requirements (e.g., non-repudiation), and take into account the limitations blockchain poses for other security requirements (e.g., confidentiality). However, we are not aware of any existing work that aims at addressing such issues following a similar approach. In this article, we propose SecBPMN2BC: a model-driven approach to designing business processes with security requirements that are meant to be deployed on blockchains. SecBPMN2BC consists of: (i) an extension of BPMN 2.0 that allows designing secure smart contracts; (ii) a set of algorithms and their implementation that check incompatible security requirements and help the design of smart contracts; (iii) a workflow that guides the application of the method. The method has been validated with a survey conducted on security and BPMN experts. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Blockchain introduces challenges related to the reliability of user identity and identity management systems; this includes detecting unfalsified identities linked to IoT applications. This study focuses on optimizing user identity verification time by employing an efficient encryption algorithm for the user signature in a peer-to-peer decentralized IoT blockchain network. To achieve this, a user signature-based identity management framework is examined by using various encryption techniques and contrasting various hash functions built on top of the Modified Merkle Hash Tree (MMHT) data structure algorithm. The paper presents the execution of varying dataset sizes based on transactions between nodes to test the scalability of the proposed design for secure blockchain communication. The results show that the MMHT data structure algorithm using SHA3 and AES-128 encryption algorithm gives the lowest execution time, offering a minimum of 36% gain in time optimization compared to other algorithms. This work shows that using the AES-128 encryption algorithm with the MMHT algorithm and SHA3 hash function not only identifies malicious codes but also improves user integrity check performance in a blockchain network, while ensuring network scalability. Therefore, this study presents the performance evaluation of a blockchain network considering its distinct types, properties, components, and algorithms’ taxonomy. © 2023 by the authors.},

This way, users are not required to share their training data with other parties, maintaining user privacy; however, the vanilla federated learning proposal is mainly assumed to be run in a trusted environment, while the actual implementation of federated learning is expected to be performed in untrusted domains. This paper aims to use blockchain as a trusted federated learning platform to realize the missing “running on untrusted domain” requirement. First, we investigate vanilla federate learning issues such as client’s low motivation, client dropouts, model poisoning, model stealing, and unauthorized access. From those issues, we design building block solutions such as incentive mechanism, reputation system, peer-reviewed model, commitment hash, and model encryption. We then construct the full-fledged blockchain-based federated learning protocol, including client registration, training, aggregation, and reward distribution. Our evaluations show that the proposed solutions made federated learning more reliable. Moreover, the proposed system can motivate participants to be honest and perform best-effort training to obtain higher rewards while punishing malicious behaviors. Hence, running federated learning in an untrusted environment becomes possible. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We propose to use blockchain to act as the channel that requesters and vehicles communicate in. Smart contracts are the main designable parts to do the interactions among the participants.

Based on the blockchain technology, the system adopts a distributed architecture to establish a secure and trustworthy logistics data management platform to achieve the integrity and trace-ability of data in the logistics process. The data dual-chain storage strategy is used to ensure the efficiency of data queries. Furthermore, four smart contracts including order management contract (OMC), access control management contract (ACC), access control policy management contract (ACPC), and environmental data management contract (EDC) are designed in combination with the attribute-based access control strategy. By triggering the smart contract, the controllable access of order data can be realized. Finally, two groups of experiments are designed to test the performance of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed system can maintain high throughput in a large-scale request environment under the premise of ensuring data security. © 2022, ComSIS Consortium.

	abstract = {Smart contracts are a promising means of formalizing and reliably enforcing agreements between entities using distributed ledger technology (DLT). Research has revealed that a significant number of smart contracts are subject to programming flaws, making them vulnerable to attacks and leading to detrimental effects, such as asset loss. Researchers and developers call for a thorough analysis of challenges to identify their causes and propose solutions. To respond to these calls, we conducted two literature reviews and diverse expert interviews and synthesized scattered knowledge on challenges and solutions. We identified 29 challenges (e.g., code visibility, code updateability, and encapsulation) and 60 solutions (e.g., gas limit specification, off-ledger computations, and shadowing). Moreover, we developed 20 software design patterns (SDPs) in collaboration with smart contract developers. The SDPs help developers adjust their programming habits and thus support them in their daily development practices. Our results provide actionable knowledge for smart contract developers to overcome the identified challenges and offer support for comparing smart contract integration concepts across three fundamentally different DLT protocols (i.e., Ethereum, EOSIO, and Hyperledger Fabric). Moreover, we support developers in becoming aware of peculiarities in smart contract development and the resulting benefits and drawbacks.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

Firstly, a multi-source heterogeneous distribution network model based on Intelligent contract is established. Secondly, a multi-source heterogeneous distribution network market transaction mechanism is proposed. The mechanism designs different kinds of transaction members, frameworks and processes. Transaction members can participate in the market quotation and determine the transaction unit price according to their own power surplus and shortage state. Finally, a smart contract solution with blind beat mechanism is designed for the proposed transaction mechanism. The effectiveness of the transaction mechanism is verified by an example and deployed on the Ethereum private chain. The effectiveness of the transaction mechanism is verified by an example and deployed on the Ethereum private chain. Through the simulation transaction analysis, it can be seen that the above transaction mechanism effectively improves the economic benefits of trading members and effectively ensures the market security and free competition. © 2022 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The application of renewable energy sources in the power grid increases the necessity of tracking the system state, especially in smart grids, where there is a bidirectional transfer of data and power. The complexity of coupling between communication and the electrical infrastructure in a smart grid increases the risk of security breaches. Increasing the state estimation accuracy helps the smart grid operator efficiently manage the system. This article proposes an integration of distributed state estimation with a blockchain-designed communication platform. Additionally, the asynchronous data transmission, which is more likely to happen in the real world, is considered as the second task of this research. Finally, a detailed analysis of the blockchain-based application in distributed state estimation is provided. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed method meets real-world performance requirements and brings high security and reliability to the distributed state estimation process.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is a growing demand for transparency along the agri-food chain, both from customers and governments. The adoption of blockchain technology to enable secure traceability for the management of the agri-food chain, provide information such as the provenance of a food product and prevent food fraud, is emerging rapidly, due to the inherent trust and inalterability provided by this technology. However, developing the right smart contracts for these use cases is even more of a challenge than it is for those used in other fields. Several management systems for the agri-food chain based on blockchain technology and smart contract have been proposed, all however ad-hoc for a specific product or production process and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a new approach to easily customize and compose general Ethereum-based smart contracts designed for the agri-food industrial domain, to be able to reuse the code and modules and automate the process to shorten development times, while keeping it safe and reliable. Starting from the definition of the real production process, we aim to automatically generate both the smart contracts to manage the system and the user interfaces to interact with them, thus producing a system that works semi-automatically. Additionally, we describe a honey production case study to show how our approach works. Future work will first extend the scope of the approach to other supply chains, furthermore, while the current platform used is Ethereum, in the future our approach will be easily extended to other blockchain platforms.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The collection and sharing of electronic health records (EHRs) via the Internet of Things (IoT) can enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis. However, it is challenging to guarantee the secure search of EHR during the sharing process. The advent of blockchain is a promising solution to address the issues, owing to its remarkable features such as immutability and anonymity. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based secure sharing system over searchable encryption and hidden data structure via IoT devices. EHR ciphertexts of data owners are stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS). A user with proper access permissions can search for the desired data with the data owner's time-bound authorization and verify the authenticity of the search result. After that, the data user can access the relevant EHR ciphertext from IPFS using a symmetric key. The scheme jointly uses searchable encryption and smart contract to realize secure search, time control, verifiable keyword search, fast search, and forward privacy in IoT scenarios. Performance analysis and proof demonstrate that the proposed protocol can satisfy the design goals. In addition, performance evaluation shows the high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2022 Xueli Nie et al.},

Further, a sensing network and connectivity model is proposed to detect true fire and send an emergency service request to monitoring station.

	abstract = {The centralized storage and centralized authorization approach in medical information systems can lead to data tampering and private information privacy leakage, while the traditional access control model has an overly simple authentication approach, relies excessively on trusted third-party organizations for the enforcement of access control policies, and has low efficiency in processing access requests. To address these problems, this paper proposes an access control model based on the collaboration of blockchain main and side chains, AC-BMS. Firstly, a password-based authentication scheme is designed based on doctors’ identity information; then Polygon side chain is designed to enhance the storage scalability of the blockchain; finally, the access node information on the main Ethereum chain is located on the side chain, and resources are obtained by executing Roll-up contracts deployed on the side chain. It is confirmed by simulation experiments in Hyperledger Fabric that the access efficiency and throughput of the blockchain access model proposed in this paper are improved when the number of accesses is multiplied, the average access time is saved by 2–3 s, the latency time is floating and stable, and the security, scalability, and availability are enhanced. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The complexity associated with the management of these data requires a suitable access control approach that empowers citizens to control how their data are shared, so potential privacy issues can be mitigated. While well-known access control models are widely used in web and cloud scenarios, the IoT ecosystem needs to address the requirements of lightness, decentralization, and scalability to control the access to data generated by a huge number of heterogeneous devices. This work proposes CapBlock, a design that integrates a capability-based access control model and blockchain technology for a fully distributed evaluation of authorization policies and generation of access credentials using smart contracts. CapBlock is intended to manage the access to information in federated IoT environments where data need to be managed through access control policies defined by different data providers.

	abstract = {Background: Patient tokenization is a novel approach that allows anonymous patient-level linkage across healthcare facilities, minimizing the risk of breaching protected health information in health information exchange (HIE). Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods: We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results: A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions: This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Current traditional shipping models are increasingly revealing many shortcomings and affecting the interests of sellers and buyers due to having to depend on trusted third parties. For example, the Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) model must depend on the carrier/shipper, or the Letter-of-Credit (LoC) model depends on the place of the Letter certification (i.e., bank). There have been many examples demonstrating the riskiness of the two models above. Specifically, in developing countries (e.g., Vietnam), the demand for exporting goods and trading between sellers and buyers have not yet applied the benefits of current technology to improve traditional shipping models. Two typical examples in the last five years that have demonstrated the risks of both sellers and buyers when applying CoD and LoC models are the problem of keeping the money of the seller of GNN Expresses (2017) as well as risks in losing control of 4 containers of cashew nuts when exporting from Vietnam to Italy (2021). A series of studies have proposed solutions based on distributed storage, blockchain, and smart contracts to solve the above problems. However, the role of the shipper has not been considered in some approaches or is not suitable for deployment in a developed country (i.e., Vietnam). In this paper, we propose a combination model between the traditional CoD model and blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFT to solve the above problems. Specifically, our contribution includes four aspects: a) proposing a shipping model based on blockchain technology and smart contracts; b) proposing a model for storing package information based on Ethereum’s NFT technology (i.e. ERC721); c) implementing the proposed model by designing smart contracts that support the creation and transfer of NFTs between sellers and buyers; d) deploy smart contracts on four EVM-enabled platforms including BNB Smart chain, Fantom, Celo, and Polygon to find a suitable platform for the proposed model. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

In this paper, we introduce decentralized blockchain technology for crowdsourcing service systems and propose a method to manage and control the process of crowdsourcing design services. We depict complex crowdsourcing logic by smart contract. The process of crowdsourcing design is not dependent on any third party. It is decentralized, tamper-proof, traceable and protects the privacy of users to a certain extent. We implement this crowdsourcing design system on a specific blockchain test network to experiment and test its functionalities. Experiment results show the feasibility and usability of our crowdsourcing design system.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market, various types of digital artwork are published via NFT in recent years for sale. In the current NFT system, owner's address of each NFT is stored in plaintext. This leads to a severe privacy problem: once a person's blockchain address is known, all his NFT assets are viewable, which may further cause problems related to the privacy of holding sensitive NFT or premeditated scams to high-value NFT owners. However, due to the limitation of Ethereum and smart contract, it is hard to prevent others from tracking the owner of NFT. Meanwhile, current state-of-the-art NFT research usually assumes the relation between blockchain address and owner's identity is unknown, thus creating the so-called anonymity. In this paper, based on the most popular NFT marketplace OpenSea's system, we propose a new exchange scheme to hides the address of NFT owner during trading. To achieve our goal, a proof of commitment scheme is exploited to bind the owner to an NFT while hiding the identity. Moreover, An anonymous payment method is designed to prevent attackers from tracing the Ether flow in NFT trading. Our scheme is proven to be secure against curious users and malicious active attackers. Implementation on testnet also shows that the increased gas cost is acceptable, meaning it is suitable for application. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, single activities within the workflows are similar and constitute patterns that could allow for modularisation and eventual standardisation. An analysis of design protocols found on a document-exchange platform is performed to identify the processes within the workflows, including information about actors, activities and assets, and subsequently to recognise the patterns. High digitalisation potential is recognised on the activity level, due to numerous similarities and iterations detected between the analysed processes, mainly depending on the constellation of stakeholders. The results reveal information granularity that suffices for digitalisation of communication process flows. The proposed modular patterns represent the first step towards design workflow automation, facilitating the use of technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts.  © 2022 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In order to better mine the value of data, the author proposes a research on the automatic access control of big data open resources multimedia based on blockchain and introduces big data access control BBAC-BD (blockchain-based access control mechanism for big data environment). The author designed a strategy management contract based on the Bloom filter, as a probabilistic data structure with extremely high space utilization efficiency and proposed the strategic management contract (PAP CONTRACT) and the strategic decision contract (PDP CONTRACT). In this way, the nontampering, auditability, and verifiability of the access control information are guaranteed; then, the access control method based on smart contracts is adopted to realize the user-driven, whole-process transparent, and dynamic and automatic access control of big data resources. The simulation results show that the greater the ratio of n/k, the better the optimization effect, and the greater the ratio, the lower the corresponding misjudgment rate, but it will also take up more space costs. At the same time, the true value of the false positive rate is generally less than the theoretical value of the false positive rate. When the performance of Hash (strategy to retrieve) is better, the result of Hash distribution is more uniform. Under the condition of m = 3, the misjudgment rate acceptable for the expected use can be achieved, and the increase in the number of Hashes will not bring a significant increase in revenue. Freed from the traditional model of providing access control services based on third parties, solve the problem of transparency of authority judgments; at the same time, through smart contracts, based on the strategy published by the resource owner on the blockchain, realize automatic access control to big data resources; and make the judicial process more flexible and the judgment result more credible. The BBAC-BD mechanism realizes a safe, reliable, and transparent new access control architecture, and it can effectively promote the safe circulation and sharing of big data. © 2022 Nan Zhao et al.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based manufacturing is taking shape, and many industries seem interested to make the transition to it. Developing blockchain solutions for trusted computing is also taking its roots. Developing a blockchain-based solution for cloud-based manufacturing systems is a field that is new but also faces limitations and a lack of case studies. Smart contracts are one part of the solution which deals with making blockchain successful in cloud-based manufacturing. As we move towards smart contracts design and development for cloud-based manufacturing, there is no complete survey of smart contract and cloud manufacturing that can highlight critical, challenging issues and limitations. Most of the work found in smart contracts is mostly financial and notary-centric applications. On the cloud manufacturing side, most of the literature deals with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing systems. Therefore, there is a need to study the best practices to start manufacturing supported by blockchain smart contracts. We conducted a scoping review for smart contracts for cloud manufacturing to address the problem mentioned above. We studied the latest case studies and concepts in data extracted from digital libraries and online repositories. Furthermore, we follow the relevance and acceptance criteria of research articles for inclusion and exclusion from this work. This paper focuses on blockchain systems, smart contracts and architecture, smart contracts in the cloud, and the IoT environment. Furthermore, we tried to bridge design and implementation details for readers to understand the patterns that can replicate for cloud-based manufacturing systems. © 2022 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {With cloud computing, organizations must comply with applicable laws, policies, and best practices. Companies typically rely on cloud service providers to implement and adopt regulations. This consulting phase is often time‐consuming, costly, and not transparent. Organizations must trust the third party’s implementation and associated documentation processes. To resolve this dilemma, we present a blockchain‐based reference architecture for the automated, transparent, and notarized attestation of such compliance adaptations. Before proposing a solution, our approach is to understand the underlying research context. We conduct a machine‐learning‐supported systematic literature review to create a knowledge base. A reference architecture, including a prototype for configuring intrusion‐detection systems, is developed using design science research. A mixed‐methods‐based approach is used for the evaluation of the proposed architecture. A quantitative survey is then used to show that the user experience of the developed prototype can be rated as positive, with an average value of 0.7. Finally, two focus group discussions are used to analyze the presented prototype qualitatively. As a result, we demonstrate how to actively support secure and trustworthy communication between a cloud service provider and an organization applying blockchain configurations. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The growth of the enterprise blockchain research supporting supply chain management calls for investigations of their impact and mindfulness of their design, use cases, and pilots. With a blockchain design for the Proof of Delivery (PoD) process management, this paper contributes to learning about performance measurement and the transaction costs implications during the development and application of smart contracts. An experimental design science approach is applied to develop an open-source blockchain to explore ways to make the delivery processes more efficient, the proof of delivery more reliable, and the performance measurements more accurate. The theory of Transaction Costs is applied to evaluate the cost implications of the adoption of smart contracts in the management of the PoD. The findings show that smart contracts make the delivery processes more efficient and proof of delivery more reliable. Yet, the methods and metrics are too complex and qualitative, limiting the smart contract's capability to measure performance. Our findings indicate potential transaction costs reduction by implementing a blockchain-based performance measurement. The complexities of the delivery process and proof of delivery call for pre-contractual steps to identify the processes and performance metrics to design blockchains. Smart contracts need further development and digital aids to handle qualitative inspections and proof of delivery generation during the delivery process. The blockchain requires the system's capacity to record off-chain transactions, such as in case of disputes resolutions.

Cryptocurrency has become a new and attractive means of remittance. Thus, blockchain-based smart contracts also attract attention when central banks design digital currencies. However, it has been discovered that a significant amount of cryptoassets on blockchain are lost or stranded for a variety of reasons, including the loss of the private key or the owner's death. To address this issue, we propose a method for recoverable transactions that would replace the traditional transaction by allowing cryptoassets to be sent to a backup account address after a deadline has passed.

The crucial factor in the LCT is to ensure the validity of gathered data as numerous supply chain phases are involved and the data is assessed by multiple stakeholders. Frauds and swindling activities can be prevented if the history of the vehicles is made available to the interested parties. Blockchain provides a way of enforcing trustworthiness to the supply chain participants and the data associated with the various actions performed. Machine learning techniques when combined decentralized nature of blockchains can be used to develop a robust Vehicle LCT model. In the proposed work, Harmonic Optimized Gradient Descent and Łukasiewicz Fuzzy (HOGD-LF) Vehicle Life Cycle Tracking in Cloud Environment is proposed and it involves three stages. First, the Progressive Harmonic Optimized User Registration and Authentication model is designed for computationally efficient registration and authentication. Next, for the authentic user, the Gradient Descent Blockchain-based SVM Data Encryption model is designed with minimum CPU utilization. Finally, Łukasiewicz Fuzzy Smart Contract Verification is performed with encrypted data to ensure accurate and precise fraudulent activity deduction.

	abstract = {Nowadays, smart medical cloud platforms have become a new direction in the industry. However, because the medical system involves personal physiological data, user privacy in data transmission and processing is also easy to leak in the smart medical cloud platform. This paper proposed a medical data privacy preserving framework named PMHE based on blockchain and fully homomorphic encryption technology. The framework receives personal physiological data from wearable devices on the client side, and uses blockchain as data storage to ensure that the data cannot be tampered with or forged; Besides, it uses fully homomorphic encryption method to design disease prediction models implemented by smart contracts. In PMHE, data is encoded and encrypted on the client side, and encrypted data is uploaded to the cloud platform via the public Internet, preventing privacy leakage caused by channel eavesdropping; smart contracts run on the blockchain platform for disease prediction, and the operators participating in computing are encrypted user data too. So, privacy and security issues caused by platform data leakage are avoided. The client-to-cloud interaction protocol is also designed to overcome the defect that fully homomorphic encryption only supports addition and multiplication by submitting tuples on the client side, to ensure that the prediction model can perform complex computing. In addition, the design of the smart contract is introduced in detail, and the performance of the system is analyzed. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the operating effect of the system, ensuring that user privacy is not leaked without affecting the accuracy of the model, and realizing a smart medical cloud platform in which data can be used but cannot be borrowed. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage.

	abstract = {Smart contract vulnerability detection draws extensive attention in recent years due to the substantial losses caused by hacker attacks. Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15, 89.02, and 83.21 percent for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop vulnerabilities, respectively. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As is well known, smart contracts on the blockchain store plenty of digital assets, and these contracts deployed on the blockchain are difficult to be modified. For this reason, the analysis and detection of smart contract vulnerabilities have received extensive attention. Smartcheck, a typical Java-implemented static analysis tool of smart contracts, is capable of converting Solidity source code into path diagrams based on the lexical and syntactic analysis, and finds smart contract vulnerabilities by path matching. Although Smartcheck can analyze most of the real-world vulnerabilities, some imperceptible vulnerabilities may be ignored, causing huge economic losses. In order to address these issues, we develop a new tool named MSmart to analyze the vulnerabilities of high risk such as timestamp dependence vulnerabilities, integer overflow vulnerabilities, self-destruct vulnerabilities, etc. MSmart converts the smart contract source code into an intermediate representation, and looks for smart contract vulnerabilities based on intermediate representation and XPath rules. We add new intermediate representation rules of Smartcheck to detect more kinds of vulnerabilities and optimize existing rules to suit the complexity of smart contract. We also implemented smart contract batch detection to shorten the time it takes to find vulnerabilities. To analysis the performance of MSmart, we collect 6000 real-world contracts from Etherscan and design some comparative experiments with other tools. The results of experiment show that MSmart is able to analyze related vulnerabilities better, and false positives and false negatives have been reduced due to our improvements. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {IoT environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in terms of their distributions and included entities by collaboratively involving not only data centers known from Cloud computing but also the different types of third-party entities that can provide computing resources. To transparently provide such resources and facilitate trust between the involved entities, it is necessary to develop and implement smart contracts. However, when developing smart contracts, developers face many challenges and concerns, such as security, contracts’ correctness, a lack of documentation and/or design patterns, and others. To address this problem, we propose a new recommender system to facilitate the development and implementation of low-cost EVM-enabled smart contracts. The recommender system’s algorithm provides the smart contract developer with smart contract templates that match their requirements and that are relevant to the typology of the fog architecture. It mainly relies on OpenZeppelin, a modular, reusable, and secure smart contract library that we use when classifying the smart contracts. The evaluation results indicate that by using our solution, the smart contracts’ development times are overall reduced. Moreover, such smart contracts are sustainable for fog-computing IoT environments and applications in low-cost EVM-based ledgers. The recommender system has been successfully implemented in the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem, thus presenting its applicability. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The traditional identification method of the digital bond trading contract system is single chain identification. Due to a large number of digital bond trading users, single chain identification will affect the performance of the system in the trading process. Therefore, we aim to propose a digital bond trading contract system based on blockchain technology and study the system architecture. In this paper, the architecture of the bond trading system is optimized by using the technology of blockchain, and the software architecture is developed by using the technology of blockchain. Through the performance test of the system, the advantages of the system architecture in practical application are verified. Firstly, the overall hardware architecture of the system is designed, and the internal structure of the controller in the control layer is redeployed. Combining the Mork tree and Patricia tree, the data structure based on blockchain and the block header data structure of the transaction contract system are optimized. By analyzing the operation process of the smart contract, the process of the smart contract consensus algorithm is optimized. The system performance test results show that the performance of the designed system in system transaction throughput, transaction delay, and system security is better than the traditional system, which verifies the effectiveness and reliability of the designed system.  © 2022 Zheng Xu and Ji Liu.},

	abstract = {A rich ecosystem of blockchain-based projects has emerged since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008. New protocols seek to improve the performances of blockchain systems. In particular, the energy consumption of blockchains has been particularly decried. Unfortunately, those new proposals are often evaluated with ad hoc tools and experimental environments. Therefore, reproducibility and comparison of these new contributions with the state of the art of blockchain technologies are complicated. To the best of our knowledge, only a few tools partially address the design of a generic benchmarking of blockchain technologies (e.g., load generation). This paper introduces BCTMark, a generic framework for benchmarking blockchain technologies on an emulated network in a reproducible way. Based on this novel framework, we studied a key aspect of modern blockchains’ energy consumption: smart-contract execution. Based on experiments and the analysis of one year of real-world Ethereum transactions, we measured and modeled smart-contracts’ energy consumption on Ethereum. Furthermore, this study details how the replication of contract calls execution can impact their energy cost. In particular, we give insights on the energy consumed by smart-contracts on Ethereum over one year. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the healthcare industry has continuously grown, with hundreds of thousands of patients obtaining treatment remotely using smart devices. Data security becomes a prime concern with such a massive increase in the number of patients. Numerous attacks on healthcare data have recently been identified that can put the patient’s identity at stake. For example, the private data of millions of patients have been published online, posing a severe risk to patients’ data privacy. However, with the advent of Industry 4.0, medical practitioners can digitally assess the patient’s condition and administer prompt prescriptions. However, wearable devices are also vulnerable to numerous security threats, such as session hijacking, data manipulation, and spoofing attacks. Attackers can tamper with the patient’s wearable device and relays the tampered data to the concerned doctor. This can put the patient’s life at high risk. Since blockchain is a transparent and immutable decentralized system, it can be utilized for securely storing patient’s wearable data. Artificial Intelligence (AI), on the other hand, utilizes different machine learning techniques to classify malicious data from an oncoming stream of patient’s wearable data. An amalgamation of these two technologies would make the possibility of tampering the patient’s data extremely difficult. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a blockchain and AI-envisioned secure and trusted framework (HEART). Here, Long-Short Term Model (LSTM) is used to classify wearable devices as malicious or non-malicious. Then, we design a smart contract that allows only of those patients’ data having a wearable device to be classified as non-malicious to the public blockchain network. This information is then accessible to all involved in the patient’s care. We then evaluate the HEART’s performance considering various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, scalability, and network latency. On the training and testing sets, the model achieves accuracies of 93% and 92.92%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties involved, which often leads to “adversarial relationships”, “risk avoidance”, and a “lack of trust” among the different actors. This culture is further compounded by a “linear workflow” that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {As increasing clients tend to outsource massive multimedia data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud, data auditing is becoming crucial, as it enables clients to verify the integrity of their outsourcing data. However, most existing data auditing schemes cannot guarantee 100% data integrity and cannot meet the security requirement of practical multimedia services. Moreover, the lack of fair arbitration leads to clients not receiving compensation in a timely manner when the outsourced data is corrupted by the cloud service provider (CSP). In this work, we propose an arbitrable data auditing scheme based on the blockchain. In our scheme, clients usually only need to conduct private audits, and public auditing by a smart contract is triggered only when verification fails in private auditing. This hybrid auditing design enables clients to save audit fees and receive compensation automatically and in a timely manner when the outsourced data are corrupted by the CSP. In addition, by applying the deterministic checking technique based on a bilinear map accumulator, our scheme can guarantee 100% data integrity. Furthermore, our scheme can prevent fraudulent claims when clients apply for compensation from the CSP. We analyze the security strengths and complete the prototype’s implementation. The experimental results show that our blockchain-based data auditing scheme is secure, efficient, and practical. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent times, electronic portfolios (e‐portfolios) are being increasingly used by students and lifelong learners as digital online multimedia résumés that showcase their skill sets and achievements. E‐portfolios require secure, reliable, and privacy‐preserving credential issuance and verification mechanisms to prove learning achievements. However, existing systems provide private institution‐wide centralized solutions that primarily rely on trusted third parties to issue and verify credentials. Furthermore, they do not enable learners to own, control, and share their e‐portfolio information across organizations, which increases the risk of forged and fraudulent credentials. Therefore, we propose a consortium blockchain‐based e‐portfolio management scheme that is decentralized, secure, and trustworthy. Smart contracts are leveraged to enable learners to completely own, publish, and manage their e‐portfolios, and also enable potential employers to verify e‐port-folio credentials and artifacts without relying on trusted third parties. Blockchain is used as an immutable distributed ledger that records all transactions and logs for tamper‐proof trusted data provenance, accountability, and traceability. This system guarantees the authenticity and integrity of user credentials and e‐portfolio data. Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials are used for user profile identification, authentication, and authorization, whereas verifiable claims are used for e‐portfolio credential proof authentication and verification. We have designed and implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme using a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Based on the evaluations, our solution is feasible, secure, and privacy‐preserving. It offers excellent performance. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2019 has seen unprecedented demand for medical equipment and supplies. However, the problem of waste treatment has not yet been given due attention, i.e., the traditional waste treatment process is done independently, and it is not easy to share the necessary information. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the interaction between parties is minimized to limit infections. To evaluate the current system at medical centers, we also refer to the traditional waste treatment processes of four hospitals in Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh cities (Vietnam). Almost all hospitals are handled independently, lacking any interaction between the stakeholders. In this article, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based system for automating waste treatment processes for medical equipment and supplies after usage among the relevant parties, named Medical-Waste Chain. It consists of four components: medical equipment and supplies, waste centers, recycling plants, and sorting factories. Medical-Waste Chain integrates blockchain-based Hyperledger Fabric technology with decentralized storage of medical equipment and supply information, and securely shares related data with stakeholders. We present the system design, along with the interactions among the stakeholders, to ensure the minimization of medical waste generation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using system-wide timing and latency analysis based on the Hyperledger Caliper engine. Our system is developed based on the hybrid-blockchain system, so it is fully scalable for both on-chain and off-chain-based extensions. Moreover, the participants do not need to pay any fees to use and upgrade the system. To encourage future use of Medical-Waste Chain, we also share a proof-of-concept on our Github repository. © 2022 by the authors.},

The traditional centralized power trading model has the problems of large load, low efficiency, high cost, reliance on third parties and unreliable data. With the characteristics of decentralization and nontampering, blockchain can establish a point-To-point trusted trading environment and provide effective solutions to the above problems. Therefore, this paper proposed a distributed power market trading framework based on blockchain. In this framework, the distributed power supply characteristics and trading needs of each participant are analyzed, a complete distributed trading process based on blockchain is designed. In addition, we have studied the key technologies of distributed power market trading. With the goal of power service reputation and maximum revenue of distributed power providers, we have established a matching degree model, a distributed power market trading optimization model, and designed a smart contract-based power market trading optimization strategy and power trading settlement strategy.

In this study, we optimized the three-tier smart contract model and proposed a four-tier smart contract model that includes the proxy, verification, business, and storage layers. The proxy layer is used to link contracts with other layers, the verification layer is used to check the integrity, boundary values, and abnormal processes of contracts, the business layer is used to execute business logic, and the storage layer is used to store data uniformly. On the basis of the proposed model, an on-chain upgrade and verification algorithm is proposed, which implements on-chain upgrade, on-chain verification, and version compatibility of contracts. We then design an information exchange system based on the proposed model and algorithm and test it based on the FISCO BCOS platform. Experiments show that, compared to the three-tier model, the proposed four-tier model and algorithm can implement the on-chain upgrade and reduce the contract complexity and data migration cost at the cost of some overall deployment.  © 2023 Zhiqiang Du et al.},

	abstract = {Flexible and distributed energy markets are a reality that is progressively reaching many regions. Despite their clear benefits, they should be accepted by the prosumers. Additionally, blockchain technology and smart contracts have been characterised as a technological enabler for the energy sector and P2P Energy Markets (PEM). However, little research has been done to explore blockchain's user-centred perspective. Therefore, this paper analyses the reluctance and/or concerns of prosumers regarding smart contracts, and investigates their perception on blockchain within PEMs. The authors present the results of a survey conducted across several European countries addressing the implementation of automated trading systems and analysing the adoption of smart contracts. Considering that the main survey outcomes are related to the regulation and legislation uncertainty around blockchain usage, this paper explores also the fit of smart contracts from a legal perspective. Additionally, a set of recommendations to be used as the basis for the design and development of PEMs is delivered, aiming to adopt blockchain and smart contracts. As a key take-away, the authors confirm the crucial role that blockchain will play in the deployment of fair, secure, flexible and distributed energy markets by ensuring transparency in the exchange of information between prosumers and energy stakeholders. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {E-commerce has developed greatly in recent years, as such, its regulations have become one of the most important research areas in order to implement a sustainable market. The analysis of a large amount of reviews data generated in the shopping process can be used to facilitate regulation: since the review data is short text and it is easy to extract the features through deep learning methods. Through these features, the sentiment analysis of the review data can be carried out to obtain the users’ emotional tendency for a specific product. Regulators can formulate reasonable regulation strategies based on the analysis results. However, the data has many issues such as poor reliability and easy tampering at present, which greatly affects the outcome and can lead regulators to make some unreasonable regulatory decisions according to these results. Blockchain provides the possibility of solving these problems due to its trustfulness, transparency and unmodifiable features. Based on these, the blockchain can be applied for data storage, and the Long short-term memory (LSTM) network can be employed to mine reviews data for emotional tendencies analysis. In order to improve the accuracy of the results, we designed a method to make LSTM better understand text data such as reviews containing idioms. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, different experiments were used for verification, with all results showing that the proposed method can achieve a good outcome in the sentiment analysis leading to regulators making better decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, we achieve separation of concerns between (a) application logic and (b) its transformation into a smart contract and deployment on a blockchain with processing of selected patterns on private sidechains.

Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network. IEEE},

	abstract = {Forensic in cloud computing is an advancement of evolutionary modern forensic science that protects against cyber criminals. Single centralize point compilation and storage of data, however, overcome the authenticity of digital evidence. In order to address this serious issue, this article suggests a evolutionary modern algorithm automated forensic platform leveraging infrastructure as a cloud service (IaaS) based on Blockchain concept. This proposed forensic structural design, evidence collection of evidence and stored on a blockchain which is circulated around several peer blocks. Secure Block Verification Mechanism (SBVM) is proposed to Safeguarding the device from unauthorised users. Using the Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm search optimization algorithm for strengthening of the cloud environment, secret keys are optimally generated. On the bases of level of confidentiality, all data is stored and encrypted at cloud authentication server. Confidentiality-based Algebraically Homomorphic Cryptosystems learning is presented with a fast-forwarding algorithm for encryption. A block in the SDN controller is created for every data and information is stored in the cloud service provider and the history is recorded as metadata data about data. A hash based tree is constructed in each block by Secure Hash Algorithm version - 3 of 512 bits. By implementing graph theory-based graph neural networks in Smart Contracts, our framework enables users to track their data (GNNSC). Finally, the construction of a evidence graph using blockchain data enables evidence analysis. Experiments was carried out in a Python programming and blockchain integrated cloud environment with network simulator-3.30 (for Software Defined Network). As part of result our newly designed forensic architecture using blochchain (FAuB) good results in terms of evidence response time, insertion times of cloud evidence, verification time of evidence, computational overhead of evidence, hashes calculation time, keys generations times of evidence, evidence encryption time, evidence decryptions time, and total overall change rate of evidence, according to a comprehensive comparative study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A smart contract is a program executed on a blockchain, based on which many cryptocurrencies are implemented, and is being used for automating transactions. Due to the large amount of money that smart contracts deal with, there is a surging demand for a method that can statically and formally verify them. This article describes our type-based static verification tool Helmholtz for Michelson, which is a statically typed stack-based language for writing smart contracts that are executed on the blockchain platform Tezos. Helmholtz is designed on top of our extension of Michelson’s type system with refinement types. Helmholtz takes a Michelson program annotated with a user-defined specification written in the form of a refinement type as input; it then typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and invocation of another contract. Helmholtz successfully verifies several practical Michelson programs, including one that transfers money to an account and that checks a digital signature. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ensuring a production-ready state of the application under development is the imminent feature of the Continuous Delivery (CD) approach. In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories. For the sake of verification, tests have been conducted for the electricity consumption and supply management system designed for prosumers of renewable energy. © 2021 by the author.

This work proposes a symbolic model for Blindcoin and conducts comprehensive formal verification. Fine-grained security goals of Blindcoin are formalized and subsequently encoded as model lemmas. However, it is challenging to verify the Blindcoin in a formal and automatic way. To tackle the challenges, we propose a tool-friendly symbolic model that can capture the semantics of multi-layers of Bitcoin and the features of Blindcoin. Our formal verification covers real-world security scenarios and discovers the Blindcoin vulnerabilities without human interaction. Furthermore, we offer several suggestions to fix the detected Blindcoin vulnerabilities and discuss the generalization of the proposed model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In Smart Grid (SG), Transactive Energy Management (TEM) is one of the most promising approaches to boost consumer participation in energy generation, energy management, and establishing decentralized energy market models using Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2P, a prosumer produces electric energy at their place using Renewable Energy Resources (RES) such as solar energy, wind energy, etc. Then, this generated energy is traded with consumers (who need the energy) in a nearby locality. P2P facilitates energy exchange in localized micro-energy markets of the TEM system. Such decentralized P2P energy management could cater to diverse prosumers and utility business models. However, the existing P2P approaches suffer from several issues such as single-point-of-failure, network bandwidth, scalability, trust, and security issues. To handle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized and Transparent P2P Energy Trading (DT-P2PET) scheme using blockchain. The proposed DT-P2PET scheme aims to reduce the grid’s energy generation and management burden while also increasing profit for both consumers and prosumers through a dynamic pricing mechanism. The DT-P2PET scheme uses Ethereum-blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for the P2P energy trading. Furthermore, a recommender mechanism is also introduced in this study to increase the number of prosumers. The Ethereum SCs are designed and deployed to perform P2P in real time in the proposed DT-P2PET scheme. The DT-P2PET scheme is evaluated based on the various parameters such as profit generation (for prosumer and consumer both), data storage cost, network bandwidth, and data transfer rate in contrast to the existing approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The key issue in the field of smart contract security is efficient and rapid vulnerability detection in smart contracts. Most of the existing detection methods can only detect the presence of vulnerabilities in the contract and can hardly identify their type. Furthermore, they have poor scalability. To resolve these issues, in this study, we developed a smart contract vulnerability detection model based on multi‐task learning. By setting auxiliary tasks to learn more directional vulnerability features, the detection capability of the model was improved to realize the detection and recognition of vulnerabilities. The model is based on a hard‐sharing design, which consists of two parts. First, the bottom sharing layer is mainly used to learn the semantic information of the input contract. The text representation is first transformed into a new vector by word and positional embedding, and then the neural network, based on an attention mechanism, is used to learn and extract the feature vector of the contract. Second, the task‐specific layer is mainly employed to realize the functions of each task. A classical convolutional neural network was used to construct a classification model for each task that learns and extracts features from the shared layer for training to achieve their respective task objectives. The experimental results show that the model can better identify the types of vulnerabilities after adding the auxiliary vulnerability detection task. This model realizes the detection of vulnerabilities and recognizes three types of vulnerabilities. The multi‐task model was observed to perform better and is less expensive than a single‐task model in terms of time, computation, and storage. © 2022 by the authors.

We offered a smart contract (SC)‐based solution (Block‐HPCT) that has been successfully tested to preserve a digital health passport (DHP) for vaccine recipients; also, for contact tracing (CT) we employed proof of location concept, which aids in a swift and credible response directly from the appropriate healthcare authorities. To connect on-chain and off‐chain data, trusted and registered oracles were integrated and to provide a double layer of security along with symmetric key encryption; both Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric were merged as storage center. We also provided a full description of the suggested solutionʹs system design, implementation, experiment results, and evaluation (privacy and cost analysis). As per the findings, the suggested approach performed satisfactorily across all significant assessment criteria, implying that it can lead the way for practical implementations and also can be used for similar types of situations where contact tracing of infectious can be crucial. © 2022 by the authors.

The business logic of dApps is usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii) assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants. On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption perspective. An experiment involving 2186 smart contracts demonstrates that the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code segments that need optimizations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

It is highly desired to ensure the quality of smart contract source code before they are deployed. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based tool, MANDO-GURU, that aims to accurately detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts at both coarse-grained contract-level and fine-grained line-level. Using a combination of control-flow graphs and call graphs of Solidity code, we design new heterogeneous graph attention neural networks to encode more structural and potentially semantic relations among different types of nodes and edges of such graphs and use the encoded embeddings of the graphs and nodes to detect vulnerabilities. Our validation of real-world smart contract datasets shows that MANDO-GURU can significantly improve many other vulnerability detection techniques by up to 24% in terms of the F1-score at the contract level, depending on vulnerability types. It is the first learning-based tool for Ethereum smart contracts that identify vulnerabilities at the line level and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based techniques by up to 63.4%.

	abstract = {Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and compelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet. Smart contracts from various fields now hold over one trillion dollars worth of virtual coins, attracting numerous attacks. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state of the contract and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence S 1 by appending a new sequence S 2 , so that the appended sequence S 2 can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state; 2) we incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch; 3) we engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods, and (iii) IR-Fuzz is fast, generating an average of 350 test cases per second. Our implementation and dataset are released at https://github.com/Messi-Q/IR-Fuzz, hoping to facilitate future research.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electronic Health Record (EHR) and its privacy have attracted widespread attention with the development of the healthcare industry in recent years. As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this article, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that MedShare is efficient for EHR sharing. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to globalization and advances in network technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with edge computing has gained increasingly more attention over the last few years. The technology provides a new paradigm to design interconnected distributed nodes in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicle networks for communications between vehicles in smart cities. The process hierarchy of the current UAV-assisted networks is also becoming more multifaceted as more vehicles are connected, requiring accessing and exchanging information, performing tasks, and updating information securely. This poses serious issues and limitations to centralized UAV-assisted vehicle networks, directly affecting computing-intensive tasks and data offloading. This paper bridges these gaps by providing a novel, transparent, and secure lifecycle for UAV-assisted distributed vehicle communication using blockchain hyperledger technology. A modular infrastructure for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is designed and ‘B-UV2X’, a blockchain hyperledger fabric-enabled distributed permissioned network-based consortium structure, is proposed. The participating nodes of the vehicle are interconnected with others in the chain of smart cities and exchange different information such as movement, etc., preserving operational logs on the blockchain-enabled immutable ledger. This automates IoV transactions over the proposed UAV-assisted vehicle-enabled consortium network with doppler spread. Thus, for this purpose, there are four different chain codes that are designed and deployed for IoV registration, adding new transactions, updating the ledger, monitoring resource management, and customized multi-consensus of proof-of-work. For lightweight IoV authentication, B-UV2X uses a two-way verification method with the defined hyperledger fabric consensus mechanism. Transaction protection from acquisition to deliverance and storage uses the NuCypher threshold proxy re-encryption mechanism. Simulation results for the proposed B-UV2X show a reduction in network consumption by 12.17% compared to a centralized network system, an increase in security features of up to 9.76%, and a reduction of 7.93% in the computational load for computed log storage. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based platforms utilise cryptographic protocols to enforce the correct behaviour of users, as well as to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against malicious adversaries. Cryptography is, however, an ever-evolving discipline, and any breakthrough would have immediate consequences on the security of blockchain-based applications. A possible threat currently under investigation is given by the development of quantum computers, since several wide-adopted cryptographic protocols have been proved to be unsafe against quantum-capable adversaries. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the management of cryptographic primitives in smart-contract-based ledgers, discussing how it fits in both a (partially) permissioned and a fully permissionless setting. The cryptographic protocols are managed in a flexible manner via a set of smart-contracts defined on the ledger itself, in this way the choice of algorithms and parameters can change quickly. Among the advantages of this approach, we remark how it allows designing an adaptive post-quantum-based blockchain that keeps up with ongoing technological advances. In general, the introduction of new features and the application of fixes to a blockchain cause forks in the chain, which may cause major disruptions. The use of smart contracts in blockchain management allows to avoid this problem, dynamically introducing new protocols or deprecating old ones without compromising previous data. The Cryptographic Kernel approach has been adopted by Quadrans, an open-source, public, decentralised smart-contract-based blockchain with a specific focus on the needs of industry, complex supply chains, and IOT devices. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this paper, a layered architecture incorporating Blockchain technology (BCT) and Machine Learning (ML) is proposed in the context of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) for smart manufacturing applications. The proposed architecture is composed of five layers covering sensing, network/protocol, transport enforced with BCT components, application and advanced services (i.e., BCT data, ML and cloud) layers. BCT enables gathering sensor access control information, while ML brings its effectivity in attack detection such as DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), injection, man in the middle (MitM), brute force, cross-site scripting (XSS) and scanning attacks by employing classifiers differentiating between normal and malicious activity. The design of our architecture is compared to similar ones in the literature to point out potential benefits. Experiments, based on the IIoT dataset, have been conducted to evaluate our contribution, using four metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are evaluated regarding these four metrics. Even if more experiments are required, it is illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce significantly the number of DDoS, injection, brute force and XSS attacks and threats within an advanced framework for sensor access control in IIoT networks based on a smart contract along with ML classifiers. © 2022 by the authors.

The smartMinutes framework improves current practices related to the meeting minutes process by providing automation in areas where possible, and doing so in a transparent, flexible, reliable, and tamper-proof manner. The last feature is of paramount importance due to the fact that meeting minutes offer legal protection, as they are considered official records of the actions taken by an organisation. Additionally, smartMinutes supports meeting agendas with non-voting items as well as voting items, offering a pool of three voting schemes, executing under three different configurations. A particular configuration, the hidden mode, provides for secrecy while at the same time guaranteeing transparency. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In democratic societies including Iraq, electronic voting (e-voting) is an available option as a viable voting system. This system is more economically advisable than face-to-face voting by eliminating the need to pay poll staff. It may also make voting more accessible to the population with impairments and those living overseas. This study will propose an e-voting system based on smart contracts by using a decentralized private Blockchain. The proposed e-voting system will provide transparency, accuracy, fairness, eligibility, anonymity, verifiability, and immutability. This research proposed the most secure way of voting with the help of Blockchain using a mobile application that can be used to implement a large-scale solution and is cost-effective. The Blockchain-based system has been designed in conjunction with the existing ECC cryptosystem to assure the dependability, anonymity, and security of votes and voters. The system that has been developed can be used to properly conduct elections, using a quick response code (QR Code), face recognition, and fingerprint for identification before casting a ballot to ensure eligibility. This results in using mobile smartphones in the voting process where voters can observe the transparency of their votes. Furthermore, eliminates the possibility of fraud and manipulation of the votes made due to the used blockchain for secure storage. © 2022 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The opportunistic fog radio access network (OF-RAN) expands its offloading computation capacity on-demand by establishing virtual fog access points (v-FAPs), comprising user devices with idle resources recruited opportunistically to execute the offloaded tasks in a distributed manner. OF-RAN is attractive for providing computation offloading services to resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices from vertical industrial applications such as smart transportation, tourism, mobile healthcare, and public safety. However, the current OF-RAN design is lacking a trusted and distributed mechanism for automating its processes such as v-FAP formation and service execution. Motivated by the recent emergence of blockchain, with smart contracts as an enabler of trusted and distributed systems, we propose an automated mechanism for OF-RAN processes using smart contracts. To demonstrate how our smart-contract-based automation for OF-RAN could apply in real life, a federated deep learning (DL) use-case where a resource-limited client offloads the resource-intensive training of its DL model to a v-FAP is implemented and evaluated. The results validate the DL and blockchain performances of the proposed smart-contract-enabled OF-RAN. The appropriate setting of process parameters to meet the often competing requirements is also demonstrated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts constitute the foundation for blockchain distributed applications. These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This phenomenon needs to be considered in the sense not only as a form of financial transactions but also in other fields such as health, which is also a challenge for modern society. In addition, several government policies have also supported the provision of health services as a form of improving people’s living standards in the form of insurance. In this study, we try to design the system by using UML diagram and simulate the use of DApps offered by the Vexanium Ecosystem. For example, three basic activities between patients, doctors, and insurance will be simulated in the form of the transaction ledger. This method allows us to speed up the authentication process that previously needed to be performed for a long time with bureaucracy becoming the rule in smart contracts in a matter of minutes. The evaluation of this method will then be compared with eight existing blockchain projects. The result in healthcare processes is cost savings through increased automation, speed, standardization, and efficiency. All of this can be a preliminary analysis of its application in Indonesia, particularly related to the authentication and recording of medical records. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts have shown growing popularity across blockchains (e.g., EOSIO) recently. Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, Wasm smart contracts suffer from various attacks exploiting their vulnerabilities. Even worse, few developers released the source code of their Wasm smart contracts for security review, raising the bar for uncovering vulnerable contracts. Although a few approaches have been proposed to detect vulnerable Wasm smart contracts, they have several major limitations, e.g., low code coverage, low accuracy and lack of scalability, unable to produce exploit payloads, etc. To fill the gap, in this paper, we design and develop WASAI, a new concolic fuzzer for uncovering vulnerabilities in Wasm smart contract after tackling several challenging issues. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate WASAI, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. For example, it achieves 2x code coverage than the baselines and surpasses them in detection accuracy, with an F1-measure of 99.2%. Moreover, WASAI can handle complicated contracts (e.g., contracts with obfuscation and sophisticated verification). Applying WASAI to 991 deployed smart contracts in the wild, we find that over 70% of smart contracts are vulnerable. By the time of this study, over 300 vulnerable contracts have not been patched and are still operating on the EOSIO Mainnet. One fake EOS vulnerability reported to the EOSIO ecosystem was recently assigned a CVE identifier (CVE-2022-27134).  © 2022 ACM.},

At the same time, an inter-domain communication mechanism is designed based on the locator/identifier separation protocol and ensures the traffic of access users are authorized. A feedback module that combines traffic detection and credit evaluation is proposed, ensuring real-time detection and fast, proactive responses against malicious behavior. Ultimately, all modules are linked together through workflows to form an integrated security model.

	abstract = {Current blockchain‐based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self‐adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self‐adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so‐called selfadaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE‐BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self‐adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t‐test and Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self‐adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose SRCL, a novel, self-supervised approach for learning smart contract representations. Unlike ex-isting supervised methods, which are tied on task-specific data labels, SRCL leverages large-scale unlabeled data by self-supervised learning of both local and global information of smart contracts. It automatically extracts structural sequences from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Then, two discriminators are designed to guide the Transformer encoder to learn local and global semantic features of smart contracts. We evaluate SRCL on a dataset of 75,006 smart contracts collected from Etherscan. Experimental results show that SRCL considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art code represen-tation models on three downstream tasks.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {With the rise of digital images in our daily lives, there is a growing need to provide an image trading market where people can monetize their images and get desired images at prices that fit their budget. Those images are usually uploaded and stored onto centralized image trading service providers' servers and the transactions for image trading are processed by these providers. Unfortunately, transaction unfairness and users' privacy breaches have become major concerns since the service providers might be untrusted and able to manipulate image trading prices and infer users' private information. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address the unfairness issue by using the decentralized ledger technique and smart contract, but users' privacy protection is not considered. In this paper, we propose a fair and privacy-preserving protocol that supports image fair exchange and protect user privacy. In particular, we exploit blockchain and Merkle tree to construct a fair image trading protocol with low communication overhead based on smart contract, which serves as an external judge that resolves disputes between buyers and sellers in image transactions. Moreover, we extend a popular short group signature scheme to protect users' identity privacy, prevent linkability of transactions from being inferred, and ensure traceability of malicious users who may sell fake images and/or refuse to pay. Finally, we design and build a practical and open-source image trading system to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in real-world applications. © 2021 Le Wang et al.},

	abstract = {A feasible approach commonly discussed in the literature for mitigating location privacy threats in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is the use of pseudonyms instead of real vehicle identifications. However, for relevant authorities to be able to identify misbehaving vehicles through their pseudonyms, it is essential that the privacy protection mechanisms only allow for conditional anonymity and not complete anonymity. In this paper, we propose the use of a permissioned consortium blockchain system with smart contract feature to facilitate secure and conditional privacy-preserving vehicular pseudonym issuance and management in a multi-jurisdictional road network. The use of a permissioned consortium blockchain helps mitigate security risks associated with the complexities in interorganizational data handling, such as in the areas of access control, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The proposed system architecture takes advantage of the predicted wide availability of Roadside Units (RSUs), and the highly viable, flexible and mature Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology for usage in vehicular pseudonymous communications. We successfully carried out a small-scale simulation of the proposed architecture using the Vehicles in Network Simulation (Veins) platform for integrated traffic and network simulation services (SUMO as the traffic simulator and OMNeT++ as the network simulator), and the Hyperledger Fabric platform as the permissioned consortium blockchain system. Simulation and performance analysis results reveal the feasibility of practical deployment of the scheme, and show that the scheme addresses the identified shortfalls of existing works, including the ability to achieve a better balance between connectivity and storage requirements.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a peer to peer (P2P), blockchain based energy trading market platform for residential communities with the objective of reducing overall community peak demand and household electricity bills. Smart homes within the community place energy bids for its available distributed energy resources (DERs) for each discrete trading period during a day, and a double auction mechanism is used to clear the market and compute the market clearing price (MCP). The marketplace is implemented on a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, where bids are stored to the immutable ledger and smart contracts are used to implement the MCP calculation and award service contracts to all winning bids. Utilizing the blockchain obviates the need for a trusted, centralized auctioneer, and eliminates vulnerability to a single point of failure. Simulation results show that the platform enables a community peak demand reduction of 46%, as well as a weekly savings of 6%. The platform is also tested at a real-world Canadian microgrid using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, to show the end to end connectivity of smart home DERs to the platform. © 2019 IEEE.},

Timely and accurate testing is paramount to an effective response to this pandemic as it helps identify infections and therefore mitigate (isolate/cure) them. In this paper, we investigate this challenge and contribute by presenting a blockchain-based solution that incorporates self-sovereign identity, re-encryption proxies, and decentralized storage, such as the interplanetary file systems (IPFS). Our solution implements digital medical passports (DMP) and immunity certificates for COVID-19 test-takers. We present smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain written and tested successfully to maintain a digital medical identity for test-takers that help in a prompt trusted response directly by the relevant medical authorities. We reduce the response time of the medical facilities, alleviate the spread of false information by using immutable trusted blockchain, and curb the spread of the disease through DMP. We present a detailed description of the system design, development, and evaluation (cost and security analysis) for the proposed solution. Since our code leverages the use of the on-chain events, the cost of our design is almost negligible. We have made our smart contract codes publicly available on Github.  © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of algorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research questions, i.e., Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they volatile in practice? Specifically, we introduced an in-depth study on three popular types of algorithmic stablecoins and developed a modeling framework to formalize their key design protocols. Through formal verification, the framework can identify critical conditions under which stablecoins might become volatile. Furthermore, we performed a systematic empirical analysis on real transaction activities of the Basis Cash stablecoin to relate theoretical possibilities to market observations. Lastly, we highlighted key design decisions for future development of algorithmic stablecoins. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

	abstract = {Collaborative business activities have aroused great interest from organizations because of the benefits they offer. However, sharing data, services, and resources and exposing them to external use can prevent organizations involved in collaboration from being engaged. Therefore, the need for advanced mechanisms to ensure trust between the different parties involved is paramount. In this context, blockchain and smart contracts are promising solutions for performing choreography processes. However, the seamless integration of these technologies as non-functional requirements in the design and implementation phases of inter-organizational collaborative activities is a challenging task, as reported in the literature. Consequently, we aim in the proposed approach to extend the modeling and implementation of the choreography lifecycle based on service-oriented processes. This is fulfilled by integrating blockchain transactions and smart contract calls, to allow collaboration and interoperability between different entities while guaranteeing trust and auditability. Moreover, to conduct this extension efficiently we use a BPMN choreography diagram combined with Finite State Automata to ensure a meticulous modeling which targets the processes’ internal interactions. Hyperledger Fabric is used as a permissioned blockchain for proof-of-concept implementation. A use case of COVID-19 collaborative processes is used to experiment our approach, which aims to guarantee a fluid collaboration between healthcare providers and epidemiological entities at a national scale in Morocco. © 2021.

	abstract = {The transfer of market power in electric generation from utilities to end-users spurred by the diffusion of distributed energy resources necessitates a new system of settlement in the electricity business that can better manage generation assets at the grid-edge. A new concept in facilitating distributed generation is peer-to-peer energy trading, where households exchange excess power with neighbors at a price they set themselves. However, little is known about the effects of peer-to-peer energy trading on the sociotechnical dynamics of electric power systems. Further, given the novelty of the concept, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of alternative electricity market structures and individual decision strategies on neighborhood exchanges and market outcomes. This study develops an empirical agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate peer-to-peer electricity trades in a decentralized residential energy market. The framework is applied for a case study in Perth, Western Australia, where a blockchain-enabled energy trading platform was trialed among 18 households, which acted as prosumers or consumers. The ABM is applied for a set of alternative electricity market structures. Results assess the impact of solar generation forecasting approaches, battery energy storage, and ratio of prosumers to consumers on the dynamics of peer-to-peer energy trading systems. Designing an efficient, equitable, and sustainable future energy system hinges on the recognition of trade-offs on and across, social, technological, economic, and environmental levels. Results demonstrate that the ABM can be applied to manage emerging uncertainties by facilitating the testing and development of management strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart contract, a term which was originally coined to refer to the automation of legal contracts in general, has recently seen much interest due to the advent of blockchain technology. Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited. Our study suggests several directions that researchers and practitioners can work on to help improve developers' experience on developing high-quality smart contracts.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

It requires efficient information elicitation mechanisms to guarantee that the collected data are accurately acquired and reported. Such mechanisms can be implemented via smart contracts on blockchain to enable privacy and trust. In this work we develop Orthos, a blockchain-based trustworthy framework for spontaneous location-based crowdsensing queries without assuming any prior knowledge about them. We employ game-theoretic mechanisms to incentivize agents to report truthfully and ensure that the information is collected at the desired location while ensuring the privacy of the agents. We identify six necessary characteristics for information elicitation mechanisms to be applicable in spontaneous location-based settings and implement an existing state-of-the-art mechanism using smart contracts. Additionally, as location information is exogenous to these mechanisms, we design the Proof-of-Location protocol to ensure that agents gather the data at the desired locations. We examine the performance of Orthos on Rinkeby Ethereum testnet and conduct experiments with live audience. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Moreover, adjustments in the patient’s privacy contexts are often solely from the patient’s initiative without any doctor or stakeholders’ recommendation. Therefore, we design, implement, and evaluate user-defined data privacy utilizing nudge theory for decentralized e-health systems named PDPM to tackle these issues. Patients can determine the privacy of their medical records to be closed to certain parties. Data privacy management is dynamic, which can be executed on the blockchain via the smart contract feature. Tamper-proof user-defined data privacy can resolve the dispute between the e-health entities related to privacy management and adjustments. In short, the authorized entities cannot deny any changes since every activity is recorded in the ledgers. Meanwhile, the nudge theory technique supports providing the best patient privacy recommendations based on their behaviour activities even though the final decision rests on the patient. Finally, we demonstrate how to use PDPM to realize user-defined data privacy management in decentralized e-health environments.

	abstract = {Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.

Firstly, the relatively accurate supporting rate and ranking for candidates are obtained using the Wilson score. Secondly, different feedback coefficients are calculated according to the above parameters. Finally, the account points are adjusted according to the feedback coefficients. The feedback mechanism is designed in the voting smart contract, and the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain to ensure the enforcement of the feedback mechanism. A fully functional smart contract is designed and briefly verified in this paper. The experiment is conducted under the K-out-of-L type of weighted voting. Experimental results show that the Wilson score can accurately modify the candidates’ supporting rates, and the feedback mechanism can effectively suppress malicious votes. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, the applications that rely on them will eventually need to migrate from one blockchain instance to another to remain competitive and secure, as well as to enhance the business process, performance, cost efficiency, privacy, and regulatory compliance. However, the differences in data and smart contract representations, modes of hosting, transaction fees, as well as the need to preserve consistency, immutability, and data provenance introduce unique challenges over database migration. We first present a set of blockchain migration scenarios and data fidelity levels using an illustrative example.

However, many of the CMaaS platforms are centralized with data flowing through an intermediary agent connecting clients with service providers. This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	abstract = {The delegating computation has become an irreversible trend, together comes the pressing need for fairness and efficiency issues. To solve this problem, we leverage game theory to propose a smart contract-based solution. First, according to the behavioral preferences of the participants, we design an incentive contract to describe the motivation of the participants. Next, to satisfy the fairness of the rational delegating computation, we propose a rational delegating computation protocol based on reputation and smart contract. More specifically, rational participants are to gain the maximum utility and reach the Nash equilibrium in the protocol. Besides, we design a reputation mechanism with a reputation certificate, which measures the reputation from multiple dimensions. The reputation is used to assure the client’s trust in the computing party to improve the efficiency of the protocol. Then, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to evaluate the proposed protocol. The simulation and analysis results show that the proposed protocol solves the complex traditional verification problem. We also conduct a feasibility study that involves implementing the contracts in Solidity and running them on the official Ethereum network. Meanwhile, we prove the fairness and correctness of the protocol. © 2021, The Author(s).},

This survey investigates how blockchain technology can be useful in the scope of supporting health actions that can reduce the spread of COVID-19 infections and allow a return to normality. Since the prominent use of blockchains to mitigate COVID-19 consequences are in the area of contact tracing and vaccine/immunity passport support, the survey mainly focuses on these two classes of applications. The aim of the survey is to show that only a proper combination of blockchain technology with advanced cryptographic techniques can guarantee a secure and privacy preserving support to fight COVID-19. In particular, this article first presents these techniques, i.e. zero-knowledge, Diffie Hellman, blind signatures, and proxy re-encryption, then describes how they are used in combination with blockchains to define robust and privacy-preserving solutions.

Also, the privacy of video providers and requesters and the security of requested video data are much more threatened. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, a blockchain-enabled CMEC video transmission model (Bl-CMEC) for intelligent video caching and transcoding will be proposed to ensure the transactions' transparency, system security, user information privacy, and integrity of the video data, enhance the ability of severs in actively caching popular video content in the CMEC system, and realize transcoding function at network edge nodes. Furthermore, we chose a scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to intelligently access the intracluster joint caching and transcoding decisions. Then, the joint video caching and transcoding decision smart contract is specially designed to automatically manage the transaction process of the joint caching and transcoding service, which records key information of joint caching and transcoding transactions and payment information on a continuous blockchain. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Bl-CMEC framework not only can provide users with better QoE performance for video streaming service but also can ensure the security, integrity, and consistency for the video providers, video requesters, and video data.  © 2021 Yan Li and Zheng Wan.},

	abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quality-of-service (QoS) is the term used to evaluate the overall performance of a service. In healthcare applications, efficient computation of QoS is one of the mandatory requirements during the processing of medical records through smart measurement methods. Medical services often involve the transmission of demanding information. Thus, there are stringent requirements for se-cure, intelligent, public-network quality-of-service. This paper contributes to three different aspects. First, we propose a novel metaheuristic approach for medical cost-efficient task schedules, where an intelligent scheduler manages the tasks, such as the rate of service schedule, and lists items uti-lized by users during the data processing and computation through the fog node. Second, the QoS efficient-computation algorithm, which effectively monitors performance according to the indicator (parameter) with the analysis mechanism of quality-of-experience (QoE), has been developed. Third, a framework of blockchain-distributed technology-enabled QoS (QoS-ledger) computation in healthcare applications is proposed in a permissionless public peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which stores medical processed information in a distributed ledger. We have designed and deployed smart contracts for secure medical-data transmission and processing in serverless peering networks and handled overall node-protected interactions and preserved logs in a blockchain distributed ledger. The simulation result shows that QoS is computed on the blockchain public network with transmission power = average of −10 to −17 dBm, jitter = 34 ms, delay = average of 87 to 95 ms, throughput = 185 bytes, duty cycle = 8%, route of delivery and response back variable. Thus, the proposed QoS-ledger is a potential candidate for the computation of quality-of-service that is not limited to e-healthcare distributed applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals' quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Currently, an increasing number of third-party applications exploit the Bitcoin blockchain to store tamper-proof records of their executions, immutably. For this purpose, they leverage the few extra bytes available for encoding custom metadata in Bitcoin transactions. A sequence of records of the same application can thus be abstracted as a stand-alone subchain inside the Bitcoin blockchain. However, several existing approaches do not make any assumptions about the consistency of their subchains, either (i) neglecting the possibility that this sequence of messages can be altered, mainly due to unhandled concurrency, network malfunctions, application bugs, or malicious users, or (ii) giving weak guarantees about their security. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an improved version of a consensus protocol formalized in our previous work, built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, to incentivize third-party nodes to consistently extend their subchains. Besides, we perform an extensive analysis of this protocol, both defining its properties and presenting some real-world attack scenarios, to show how its specific design choices and parameter configurations can be crucial to prevent malicious practices. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts can be implemented using either centralized or decentralized (blockchain) platforms. However, for a large class of applications, neither of these two alternatives on its own can provide adequate scalability, performance, quality of service, security, and trust requirements. We argue that for many applications, hybrid solutions that combine both on and off-blockchain components are more adequate. In this article, we introduce the design and implementation of a novel hybrid smart contract architecture built using the Ethereum blockchain connected to a centralized smart contract management system developed by us. We then compare and evaluate the implementation of an asset tracking service using three different architectures: on-chain, off-chain, and hybrid. We demonstrate that using a hybrid architecture, we can substantially improve performance of applications while retaining security and trust for critical tasks. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {A popular method in practice offloads computation and storage in blockchains by relying on committing only hashes of off-chain data into the blockchain. This mechanism is acknowledged to be vulnerable to a stalling attack: the blocks corresponding to the committed hashes may be unavailable at any honest node. The straightforward solution of broadcasting all blocks to the entire network sidesteps this data availability attack, but it is not scalable. In this paper, we propose ACeD, a scalable solution to this data availability problem with O(1) communication efficiency, the first to the best of our knowledge. The key innovation is a new protocol that requires each of the N nodes to receive only O(1/N) of the block, such that the data is guaranteed to be available in a distributed manner in the network. Our solution creatively integrates coding-theoretic designs inside of Merkle tree commitments to guarantee efficient and tamper-proof reconstruction; this solution is distinct from Asynchronous Verifiable Information Dispersal [7] (in guaranteeing efficient proofs of malformed coding) and Coded Merkle Tree [25] (which only provides guarantees for random corruption as opposed to our guarantees for worst-case corruption). We implement ACeD with full functionality in 6000 lines of Rust code, integrate the functionality as a smart contract into Ethereum via a high-performance implementation demonstrating up to 10,000 transactions per second in throughput and 6000x reduction in gas cost on the Ethereum testnet Kovan.

	abstract = {Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several instances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars were lost in buggy smart contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on redactable blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the existing proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and cannot be integrated with existing running blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This work demonstrates that the traditional build-new-chain approach for blockchain redactions is not necessary. We present Reparo (In the Harry Potter universe, ‘ Reparo ’ is a spell that repairs objects), a publicly verifiable layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. We present an efficient instantiation of Reparo over Ethereum (with proof of work based consensus) for repairing smart contract bugs. In this protocol, any Ethereum user may propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable. A repair operation (for instance, fixing a bug in a contract) is then performed according to the repair proposal and the state of Ethereum is updated accordingly. Reparo ’s advantages are multi-fold: (i) Since Reparo follows a layer design, it helps facilitate additional functionalities for Ethereum while maintaining the same provable security guarantees; (ii) Reparo can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements (like proof of stake), does not require heavy cryptographic machinery, and thus, can be integrated with other existing blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Cardano) as well. We evaluate Reparo with Ethereum mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs is almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity Multisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.00005 % of the Ethers that can be retrieved after the fix. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

	abstract = {Distributed ledgers using blockchain have gained traction in the supply chain industry due to their unique features of immutability and transparency. They have given people the abilities to solve business problems which were impossible using traditional systems. The US beef cattle industry lacks adequate traceability as most of the farm owners consider such data confidential; possibly harming their businesses if exposed. This article attempts to solve this problem by proposing a smart contract-based supply chain framework using a permissioned blockchain network. This system supports anonymity for the users to protect identities and lets every user store their data locally, while ensuring that the changes are recorded in the chain with cryptographic proofs (hashes). The proposed framework also has methods for the users to perform business transactions and transfer animal-related data to new owners as required. In addition to that, smart contracts have been added to conduct anonymous surveys for data aggregation. The technical contribution of this article is in the system design on how users, data, and communications are handled to maintain data ownership and user privacy while ensuring immutability and confidentiality at different levels of data aggregation. This article also contains an evaluation of the system using integration tests where the outcomes meet the expected design requirements. The framework can be applied to the US beef cattle industry as well as other supply chains with minimal modifications. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Criminals can launder crypto-currencies through mixing coins, whose original purpose is preservation of privacy in the presence of traceability. Therefore, it is essential to elaborately design mixing polices to achieve both privacy and anti-money laundering. Existing work on mixing policies relies on the knowledge of a blacklist. However, these policies are paralysed under the scenario where the blacklist is unknown or evolving. In this paper, we regard the above scenario as games under incomplete information where parties put down a deposit for the quality of coins, which is suitably managed by a smart contract in case of mixing bad coins. We extend the poison and haircut policies to incomplete information games, where the blacklist is updated after mixing. We prove the existence of equilibria for the improved polices, while it is known that there is no equilibria in the original poison and haircut policies, where blacklist is public known. Furthermore, we propose a seminal suicide policy: the one who mixes more bad coins will be punished by not having the deposit refunded. Thus, parties have no incentives to launder money by leveraging mixing coins. In effect, all three policies contrast money laundering while preserving privacy under incomplete information. Finally, we simulate and verify the validity of these policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Nowadays, the pervasivity of digital systems is making increasingly critical security, reliability, and trustworthiness of such services. When a service is delivered by involving different (eventually conflicting) parties, accountability could be achieved by including in digital transactions a trusted third party (TTP). Blockchain decentralizes trust, thus avoiding to rely on a single TTP. However, to deal with accountability in concrete solutions, the issue of securely integrating digital identity and Blockchain should be solved. The paper describes the results of a three-year research project merging academic and industrial expertise, to design and implement a Blockchain-based platform for service accountability integrating eIDAS-compliant Public Digital Identity. The platform has been used in several real-life contexts made available by industrial project partners, which demonstrated the effectiveness and novelty of the solution. © 2020 by the authors.

However, designing and implementing a smart contract is not trivial since upon deployment on a blockchain, it is no longer possible to modify it (neither for improving nor for bug fixing). It is only possible by deploying a new version of the smart contract which is costly (deployment cost for the new contract and destruction cost for the old contract). To this end, there are many solutions for testing the smart contracts before their deployment. Since realizing bug-free smart contracts increase the reliability, as well as reduce the cost, testing is an essential activity. In this paper, we group the existing solutions that attempt to tackle smart contract testing into following categories: public test networks, security analysis tools, blockchain emulators and blockchain simulators. Then, we analyze these solutions, categorize them and show what their pros and cons are.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since the advent of the microgrid (MG) concept, almost two decades ago, the energy sector has evolved from a centralized operational approach to a distributed generation paradigm challenged by the increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs) mainly based on renewable energy. This has encouraged new business models and management strategies looking for a balance between energy generation and consumption, and promoting an efficient utilization of energy resources within MGs and minimizing costs for the market participants. In this context, this paper introduces an efficient management strategy, which is aimed at obtaining a fair division of costs billed by the utilities, without relying on a centralized utility or MG aggregator, through the design of a local event-based energy market within the MG. This event-driven MG energy market operates with blockchain (BC) technology based on smart contracts for electricity transactions to both guarantee veracity and immutability of the data and automate the transactions. The event-based energy market approach focuses on two of the design limitations of BC, namely the amount of information to be stored and the computational burden, which are significantly reduced while maintaining a high level of performance. Furthermore, the prosumer data is obtained by using IEC 61850 standard-based commands within the BC framework. By doing so, the system is compatible with any device irrespective of the manufacturer implementing the IEC 61850 standard. The advantages of this management approach are considerable for: MG participants, in terms of financial benefits; the MG itself, as it can operate more independently from the main grid; and the grid since the MG becomes less unpredictable due to the internal energy exchanges. The proposed strategy is validated on an experimental setup employing low-cost devices.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Progressively, Software development organizations are investing their resources, time and, money on Software Process Improvement (SPI) since it is beneficial in the enhancement of product quality, reduction in development time, and cost of software projects. However, the existing methodologies and approaches are time-consuming and costly and their major focus is on the SPI of Large Scale Enterprises (LSEs) therefore, we are introducing blockchain in SPI to overcome its major issues such as reliance on a central body of standardization for certification, knowledge management, high cost, resource management and change in organizational culture, etc. We have performed an exploratory case study to identify the different barriers of traditional SPI approaches. To overcome the identified issues, we have proposed and implemented a new approach by performing two case studies. The first case study was performed to identify the barriers in traditional SPI approaches and the second case study was performed to validate our proposed approach. We have performed our experiments on 55 representatives of 50 organizations. According to the results of proposed approach 56.4% of the population agreed that the SPI cost will decrease, 61.8% agreed that time of SPI will decrease and 60.3% of the population agreed that BBSPI will decrease resource utilization. Moreover, 69.1% of the population agreed with the fact that proposed BBSPI will make effective knowledge management and 83.3% of the population said that an organization can mature its processes equaliant to the central certification (CMMI, ISO) body by employing proposed BBSPI. Our results affirm that the BBSPI can reduce the time, cost, resources and helps to manage knowledge used to perform SPI. Moreover, results also depict that the BBSPI can be an efficient substitute of central bodies that could help small and medium-sized organizations to conform to common process improvement models by spending less money, time, and resources with effective knowledge management. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and overall scheme for the use and management of building information modeling (BIM) in the whole building life cycle, especially the use of BIM technology for asset management and facility management. However, there is little understanding and implementation of enterprise BIM. BIM influences and changes the new project management mode of the whole life cycle of construction projects from design to construction. The safety, audit, responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of building information, responsibility traceability and customer satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the aspects of design technology, construction management, material scheduling and whole life cycle construction. This paper will provide some new ideas for the whole life cycle collaborative management of digital construction.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) arises as an innovative paradigm for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications to build cooperative trust, aggregate wireless resources, and schedule inter-and intra-network tasks among independent network entities. It establishes an open platform based on blockchain to provide diverse wireless services and applications, such as radio access, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile edge computing, via trusted interactions with enhanced security and efficiency. As a distinctive feature, B-RAN enables secure and efficient resource sharing and trading by aggregating, pooling, and coordinating resources from multiple resource hosts and owners across subnetworks. Therefore, an implementable architecture along with various functional modules shall be delicately designed. This work aims to establish a unified architecture with enhanced efficiency, security, compatibility, and flexibility for resource sharing and trading in B-RAN. Specifically, we develop a six-layer architecture that incorporates a number of novel features such as enhanced blockchain structures, secure interaction methods, efficient service mechanisms, and scalable transaction patterns. We design a number of pluggable functional modules in each layer to support diverse functions, services, and applications of resource sharing and trading. At last, we implement a practical prototype based on the layered architecture for resource-limited devices. Multiple experiments are presented to verify the performance of the proposed architecture from different aspects. IEEE},

	abstract = {The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) brought innovation along with unprecedented benefits of convenience and efficacy in many operations that were otherwise very cumbersome. This innovation explosion has surfaced a new dimension of vulnerability and physical threat to the data integrity of IoT networks. Implementing conventional cryptographic algorithms on IoT devices is not future‐proof as these devices are constrained in terms of computational power, performance, and memory. In this paper, we are proposing a novel framework, a unique model that integrates IoT networks with a blockchain to address potential privacy and security threats for data integrity. Smart contracts are instrumental in this integration process and they are used to handle device authentication, authorization and access‐control, and data management. We further share a new design model for interfaces to integrate both platforms while highlighting its performance results over the existing models. With the incorporation of off‐chain data storage into the framework, overall scalability of the system can be increased. Finally, our research concludes how the proposed framework can be fused virtually into any existing IoT applications with minimal modifications. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Many empirical software engineering studies show that there is a need for repositories where source codes are acquired, filtered and classified. During the last few years, Ethereum block explorer services have emerged as a popular project to explore and search for Ethereum blockchain data such as transactions, addresses, tokens, smart contracts’ source codes, prices and other activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the availability of this kind of service, retrieving specific information useful to empirical software engineering studies, such as the study of smart contracts’ software metrics, might require many subtasks, such as searching for specific transactions in a block, parsing files in HTML format, and filtering the smart contracts to remove duplicated code or unused smart contracts. In this paper, we afford this problem by creating Smart Corpus, a corpus of smart contracts in an organized, reasoned and up-to-date repository where Solidity source code and other metadata about Ethereum smart contracts can easily and systematically be retrieved. We present Smart Corpus’s design and its initial implementation, and we show how the data set of smart contracts’ source codes in a variety of programming languages can be queried and processed to get useful information on smart contracts and their software metrics. Smart Corpus aims to create a smart-contract repository where smart-contract data (source code, application binary interface (ABI) and byte code) are freely and immediately available and are classified based on the main software metrics identified in the scientific literature. Smart contracts’ source codes have been validated by EtherScan, and each contract comes with its own associated software metrics as computed by the freely available software PASO. Moreover, Smart Corpus can be easily extended as the number of new smart contracts increases day by day. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Currently, users’ location information is collected to provide better services or research. Using a central server to collect, store and share location information has inevitable defects in terms of security and efficiency. Using the point-to-point sharing method will result in high computation overhead and communication overhead for users, and the data are hard to be verified. To resolve these issues, we propose a new blockchain-based multi-level location secure sharing scheme. In our proposed scheme, the location data are set hierarchically and shared with the requester according to the user’s policy, while the received data can be verified. For this, we design a smart contract to implement attribute-based access control and establish an incentive and punishment mechanism. We evaluate the computation overhead and the experimental results show that the computation overhead of our proposed scheme is much lower than that of the existing scheme. Finally, we analyze the performances of our proposed scheme and demonstrate that our proposed scheme is, overall, better than existing schemes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Double auction mechanisms have been designed to trade a variety of divisible resources (e.g., electricity, mobile data, and cloud resources) among distributed agents. In such divisible double auction, all the agents (both buyers and sellers) are expected to submit their bid profiles, and dynamically achieve the best responses. In practice, these agents may not trust each other without a market mediator. Fortunately, smart contract is extensively used to ensure digital agreement among mutually distrustful agents. The consensus protocol helps the smart contract execution on the blockchain to ensure strong integrity and availability. However, severe privacy risks would emerge in the divisible double auction since all the agents should disclose their sensitive data such as the bid profiles (i.e., bid amount and prices in different iterations) to other agents for resource allocation and such data are replicated on all the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the consensus requirements will bring a huge burden for the blockchain, which impacts the overall performance. To address these concerns, we propose a hybridized TEE-Blockchain system (system and auction mechanism co-design) to privately execute the divisible double auction. The designed hybridized system ensures privacy, honesty and high efficiency among distributed agents. The bid profiles are sealed for optimally allocating divisible resources while ensuring truthfulness with a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we conduct experiments and empirical studies to validate the system and auction performance using two real-world applications. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Civic crowdfunding (CC) is a popular medium for raising funds for public projects from interested agents. With Blockchains gaining traction, we can implement CC reliably and transparently with smart contracts (SCs). The fundamental challenge in CC is free-riding. PPR, the proposal by Zubrickas [21] of giving refund bonus to the contributors when the project is not provisioned, has attractive properties. As observed by Chandra et al. [6], PPR incentivizes the agents to defer their contribution until the deadline, i.e., a race condition. For this, their proposal, PPS, considers temporal aspects of a contribution. However, PPS is computationally complex and expensive to implement as an SC. In this work, we identify essential properties a refund bonus scheme must satisfy to curb free-riding while avoiding the race condition. We prove Contribution Monotonicity and Time Monotonicity as sufficient conditions for this. We show that if a unique equilibrium is desirable, these conditions are also necessary. We propose three refund bonus schemes satisfying these conditions leading to three novel mechanisms for CC - PPRG, PPRE, and PPRP. We show that PPRG is the most cost-effective when deployed as an SC. We prove that under certain modest assumptions, in PPRG, the project is funded at equilibrium. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been developed to enhance the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Data sharing has become a key technology to break down data silos in the big data era. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is widely used in secure data-sharing schemes to realize flexible and fine-grained access control. However, in traditional CP-ABE schemes, the access structure is directly shared along with the ciphertext, potentially leading to users' private information leakage. Outsourcing data to a centralized third party can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottlenecks, and the lack of transparency in data storage and sharing casts doubts whether users' data are safe. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-based CP-ABE scheme with partially hidden access structures (BCP-ABE-PHAS) to achieve fine-grained access control while ensuring user privacy. First, we propose an efficient CP-ABE scheme with partially hidden access structures, where the ciphertext size is constant. To assist data decryption, we design a garbled Bloom filter to help users quickly locate the position of wildcards in the access structure. Then, to improve storage efficiency and system scalability, we propose a data storage scheme that combines blockchain technology and the interplanetary file system, ensuring data integrity. Finally, we employ smart contracts for a transparent data storage and sharing process without third-party participation. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed BCP-ABE-PHAS scheme can preserve policy privacy with efficient storage and low computational overhead. © 2021 Yang Ba et al.},

The traditional energy trading model is a centralized structure based on trusted third parties, and there may an issue of single-point failure and leakage of privacy. In this way, a blockchain-based framework offers a secure, efficient and transparent trading model. Initially, the participating EVs and aggregator in the trading process should register at the trusted authority. Once the registration is successfully completed, both EVs and aggregator authenticate each other mutually in an anonymous manner. Moreover, only authorized EVs (charging and discharging EVs) participate in the contrary auction mechanism to exchange power/money based on their demand.

	abstract = {ERC20 token is the most popular type of Ethereum smart contract. The daily transaction volume of these tokens exceeds 100 billion dollars, which agitates the popular notions of “decentralized banking” and “tokenized economy”. Yet, it is a common misconception to assume that the decentralization of blockchain entails the decentralization of smart contracts deployed on this blockchain. In practice, the developers of smart contracts implement administrating patterns, such as censoring certain users, creating or destroying balances on demand, destroying smart contracts, or injecting arbitrary code. These routines, which are designed to tightly control the operation of these smart contracts, turn an ERC20 token into an administrated token—the type of Ethereum smart contract that we scrutinize in this research. We discover that many smart contracts are administrated, which means that their owners solely possess an omnipotent power over these contracts. Moreover, the owners of these tokens carry lesser social and legal responsibilities compared to the traditional centralized actors that those tokens intend to disrupt. This entails two major problems: a) the owners of the tokens have the ability to quickly steal all the funds and disappear from the market; and b) if the private key of the owner’s account is stolen, all the assets might immediately turn into the property of the attacker. Therefore, the administrated ERC20 tokens are not only dissimilar to the traditional centralized asset management tools, such as banks, but they are also more vulnerable to adversarial actions by their owners or attackers. We develop a pattern recognition framework based on 9 syntactic features characterizing administrated ERC20 tokens, which we use to analyze existing smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Our analysis of 84,062 unique Ethereum smart contracts reveals that nearly 58% of them are administrated ERC20 tokens, which accounts for almost 90% of all ERC20 tokens deployed on Ethereum. To protect users from the frivolousness of unregulated token owners without depriving the ability of these owners to properly manage their tokens, we introduce SafelyAdministrated—a library that enforces a responsible ownership and management of ERC20 tokens. The library introduces three mechanisms: deferred maintenance, board of trustees and safe pause. We implement and test SafelyAdministrated in the form of Solidity abstract contract, which is ready to be used by the next generation of safely administrated ERC20 tokens. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Poor visibility is one of the major challenging factors that lowers supply chains performance. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based supply chain network model to improve the supply chain visibility. The model focuses in improving the visibility measurements properties: information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility. The proposed model consists of information sharing, traceability, and inventory visibility platforms based on Blockchain technology smart contract. The model built with Hyperledger platform and extend the Hyperledger Composer Supply Chain Network (HCSC) model. The research is designed to three main phases. First phase: the preliminary phase which is the literature review phase to identify the existing challenges in the domain. The second phase: the design and implementation phase which is the development steps of the proposed research model. The third phase: the evaluation phase which represent the performance evaluation of the proposed model and the comparisons between the proposed model and the existing models. In the evaluation performance, the common performance metrics Lead time and average inventory levels will be compared in the proposed model, Cloud-based information system, and the traditional supply chain. These proposed platforms offer an end-to-end visibility of products, orders, and stock levels for supply chain practitioners and customers within supply chain networks. Which helps managers’ access key information that support critical business decisions and offers essential criteria for competitiveness and therefore, enhance supply chain performance. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.

While most traditional, i.e., centralized, online platforms require users to register with their personal data, they potentially expose the user's identity and data to be used for unintended purposes. This work proposes TradeMap as an integrated architecture, designing and enabling an online end-to-end (e2e) trading market place, while supporting anonymous management features. TradeMap addresses the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regulations by designing a FINMA-complaint Know Your Customer (KYC) platform. Additionally, TradeMap is based on blockchains and employs Ethereum Smart Contracts (SC). Thus, trust and anonymity between the market place and the KYC system relies on zero knowledge proof-based SCs used for user identification processes. With this management approach proposed, the user authentication is only verified within the KYC platform, providing a legally valid and fully anonymous online trading platform. © 2019 IFIP.},

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has become a hot topic in various industries. With the development and maturity of blockchain technology, it has been applied to finance, law, etc., with its advantages of decentralization, openness, information security, and concealment. The application scenarios of industry are becoming more and more abundant. Compared with the traditional TPA payment contract form, the smart contract mechanism based on blockchain technology is obviously more efficient, convenient, and safe. Against this background, we design a smart payment contract suitable for cloud storage by studying Ethereum. The relationship clause in the smart payment contract should be regulated around the contract law. The smart contract payment linkage clause can be classified into three forms, including conditional effective type, contract joint type, and contract link type, which correspond to the contract law. Therefore, the contract legal system for smart contract payment linkage clauses should follow typified thinking. Based on blockchain technology, smart contracts not only reduce the number of interactions in contract execution but also allow users to stop paying for cloud services when data is lost or damaged. The precise method is to generate each node with a private chain and place the smart contract on the private chain. With the decentralization of the blockchain private chain, the advantages of read-only data, and traceability of information, the storage of smart payment contract data is more secure. Both parties to the transaction are more trustworthy. Therefore, the proposed system has a safe and efficient smart contract payment mechanism, which brings a good user experience to users, which proves the significance and value of this research.  © 2021 Xianyun Ge.},

	abstract = {Smart Contracts are software programs that are deployed and executed within a blockchain infrastructure. Due to their immutable nature, directly resulting from the specific characteristics of the deploying infrastructure, smart contracts must be thoroughly tested before their release. Testing is one of the main activities that can help to improve the reliability of a smart contract, so as to possibly prevent considerable loss of valuable assets. It is therefore important to provide the testers with tools that permit them to assess the activity they performed.Mutation testing is a powerful approach for assessing the fault-detection capability of a test suite. In this paper, we propose SuMo, a novel mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts. SuMo implements a set of 44 mutation operators that were designed starting from the latest Solidity documentation, and from well-known mutation testing tools. These allow to simulate a wide variety of faults that can be made by smart contract developers. The set of operators was designed to limit the generation of stillborn mutants, which slow down the mutation testing process and limit the usability of the tool. We report a first evaluation of SuMo on open-source projects for which test suites were available. The results we got are encouraging, and they suggest that SuMo can effectively help developers to deliver more reliable smart contracts. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent development of payment channels and their extensions (e.g., state channels) provides a promising scalability solution for blockchains which allows untrusting parties to transact off-chain and resolve potential disputes via on-chain smart contracts. To protect participants who have no constant access to the blockchain, a watching service named as watchtower is proposed - a third-party entity obligated to monitor channel states (on behalf of the participants) and correct them on-chain if necessary. Unfortunately, currently proposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We propose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to prior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch on-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain message periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being closed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are privacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors. Furthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option economically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a simple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate misbehaving parties in these scenarios.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {There lacks trust between the cloud customer and provider to enforce traditional cloud SLA (Service Level Agreement) where the blockchain technique seems a promising solution. However, current explorations still face challenges to prove that the off-chain SLO (Service Level Objective) violations really happen before recorded into the on-chain transactions. In this paper, a witness model is proposed implemented with smart contracts to solve this trust issue. The introduced role, “Witness”, gains rewards as an incentive for performing the SLO violation report, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that the witness has to tell the truth, for maximizing the rewards. This fact that the witness has to be honest is analyzed and proved using the Nash Equilibrium principle of game theory. For ensuring the chosen witnesses are random and independent, an unbiased selection algorithm is proposed to avoid possible collusions. An auditing mechanism is also introduced to detect potential malicious witnesses. Specifically, we define three types of malicious behaviors and propose quantitative indicators to audit and detect these behaviors. Moreover, experimental studies based on Ethereum blockchain demonstrate the proposed model is feasible, and indicate that the performance, ie, transaction fee, of each interface follows the design expectations. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {A smart contract is the algorithmic description of a contractual transaction protocol that is automatically executed together with the information provided by its parties. It is written in a simplified programming language that is specific to a particular domain. Not only correctness and unambiguity are its essential formal properties, but also conformance to any legislation governing the matter of the transaction. Finally, and importantly, the trustworthiness, safety and security of the platform executing the transactions are its main attributes. An emerging challenge is to define a proper engineering process to meet the demanding requirements while supporting mass production and distribution. This paper proposes the concept of smart contract engineering (SCE) to facilitate the generation of smart legal contracts, which is the combination of software engineering, formal methods and computational law. SCE aims to reduce the potential errors and improve efficiency during the contract development process, meanwhile promote the standardization of contract design methodologies. In this paper, the roadmap of an iterative refinement-based, model-driven formal design methodology is introduced, not only to validate smart contracts but also to support the whole life cycle of their engineering. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The growing adoption of Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) systems, particularly in the healthcare field, demonstrates that RFID is a positive asset for healthcare institutions. RFID offers the ability to save organizations time and costs by enabling data of traceability, identification, communication, temperature and location in real time for both people and resources. However, the RFID systems challenges are financial, technical, organizational and above all privacy and security. For this reason, recent works focus on attribute-based access control (ABAC) schemes. Currently, ABAC are based on mostly centralized models, which in environments such as the supply chain can present problems of scalability, synchronization and trust between the parties. In this manuscript, we implement an ABAC model in RFID systems based on a decentralized model such as blockchain. Common criteria for the selection of the appropriate blockchain are detailed. Our access control policies are executed through the decentralized application (DApp), which interfaces with the blockchain through the smart contract. Smart contracts and blockchain technology, on the one hand, solve current centralized systems issues as well as being flexible infrastructures that represent the relationship of trust and support essential in the ABAC model in order to provide the security of RFID systems. Our system has been designed for a supply chain environment with an use case suitable for healthcare systems, so that assets such as surgical instruments containing an associated RFID tag can only access to specific areas. Our system is deployed in both a local and Testnet environment in order to stablish a deep comparison and determining the technical feasibility. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain is an innovative technology that disrupts different industries and offers decentralized, secure, and immutable platforms. Its first appearance is connected with monetary cryptocurrency transactions, followed by adaptation in several domains. We believe that blockchain can provide a reliable environment by utilizing its unique characteristics to offer a more secure, costless, and robust mechanism suitable for a voting application. Although the technology has captured the interest of governments worldwide, blockchain as a service is still limited due to lack of application development experience, technology complexity, and absence of standardized design, architecture, and best practices. Therefore, this study aims to build an imperial example for a blockchain electronic voting (e-voting) application using digital identity management for fulfilling immutable, transparent, and secure distributed blockchain features. The paper reviews the current types of e-voting systems and discusses the standard processes. We propose a conceptual design for a blockchain providing a digital identity management service to secure the e-voting application results. The blockchain development process implemented in this study follows the Proof of Concept to verify the e-voting application’s function for illustrating the architecture and description of the application’s business process model. The development is based on the Ethereum platform, which allows the implementation of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. The developed e-voting application saves time, requires fewer processes, and results in higher accuracy, more transparency, considerable voters’ privacy, and accountable system management. We expect that the e-voting blockchain application will impact governmental processes during the election, reduce spending, support digital transformation, and ensure fairness of results. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Most self-service payment terminals require network connectivity for processing electronic payments. The necessity to maintain network connectivity increases costs, introduces cybersecurity risks, and significantly limits the number of places where the terminals can be installed. Leading payment service providers have proposed offline payment solutions that rely on algorithmically generated payment tokens. Existing payment token solutions, however, require complex mechanisms for authentication, transaction management, and most importantly, security risk management. In this paper, we present VolgaPay, a blockchain-based system that allows merchants to deploy secure offline payment terminal infrastructure that does not require collection and storage of any sensitive data. We design a novel payment protocol which mitigates security threats for all the participants of VolgaPay, such that the maximum loss from gaining full access to any component by an adversary incurs only a limited scope of harm. We achieve significant enhancements in security, operation efficiency, and cost reduction via a combination of polynomial multi-hash chain micropayment channels and blockchain grafting for off-chain channel state transition. We implement the VolgaPay payment system, and with thorough evaluation and security analysis, we demonstrate that VolgaPay is capable of delivering a fast, secure, and cost-efficient solution for offline payment terminals. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the fog computing paradigm is being consolidated as a solution for processing the explosion of data generated by lots of common IoT devices connected to the Internet. In contrast to cloud computing, fog computing achieves efficient data processing without incurring large latencies or data transfers to/from the cloud. The distributed nature of fog computing makes the resource orchestration a challenge. Commonly used centralized solutions are of limited utility in this context. Moreover, fog nodes are usually resource constrained, so the implementation of the management modules should be carefully designed in order not to cause excessive overheads. On the other hand, blockchain has proven its utility beyond cryptocurrencies, to support distributed and reliable information storage. When combined with smart contracts it can provide a distributed computer where all the nodes independently and equally contribute to a common global system state, which must be agreed by consensus. This also provides inherent desirable features, such as immutability and transparency. In this work, a novel architecture called HIDRA is presented, aimed at resource orchestration in fog computing environments based on a Ethereum blockchain implementation. A prototype implementation on a testbed composed of single-board computers has been carried out. Results show the low overhead introduced into the system and its ability to perform a coordinated action among fog nodes without the intervention of any central authority.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many decentralized applications based on blockchain (DApp) have been developed. Some development tools provide testing functions, but only for developers to write unit tests for smart contracts rather than test DApp as a whole. Moreover, due to the difficulty for testers to understand the implementation details of smart contracts, insufficient functional testing causes some DApps not to meet functional design expectations. The inherent complexity of DApp, inconvenient pre-state setting, and not-so-readable logs make DApp testing challenging. In this paper, we propose Kaya, a testing framework for DApps to bridge these gaps. Firstly, Kaya formulate automatically executed test cases that cover both front-end behaviors and back-end logics with simple setting. Secondly, Kaya provides a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set the blockchain pre-states. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible addresses into readable variables for easier comprehension. Besides, to fit the various application environments, we provide both GUI and CLI for test engineers to use Kaya.

	abstract = {Product recall management in the automotive industry is a challenging problem that affects human lives and the safe operation of automobiles. Product recalls can assist in removing potentially unsafe products from the marketplace and minimizing a company's responsibility for corporate negligence. Today's systems and technologies leveraged for product recall management in the automotive supply chain fall short in providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach to overcome the aforementioned problems related to product recall management. We employ the public Ethereum blockchain and integrate it with the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to deal with the large-sized data problem. We present the system design and six algorithms explaining the working principles, information exchange flow, and stakeholders' detail and their sequential interactions. We discuss the implementation details, generalization aspects, and cost and security analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed solution is cost-effective, secure, and enables automakers to have end-to-end visibility of information during product recalls. We make the smart contracts' code publicly available on GitHub.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The health care ecosystem involves various interconnected stakeholders with different, and sometimes conflicting security and privacy needs. Sharing medical data, sometimes generated by remote medical devices, is a challenging task. Although several solutions exist in the literature covering functional requirements such as interoperability and scalability, as well as security privacy requirements such as fine-grained access control and data privacy, balancing between them is not a trivial task as off-the-shelf solutions do not exist. On one hand, centralized cloud architectures provide scalability and interoperable access, but make strong trust assumptions. On the other, decentralized blockchain based solutions favor data privacy and independent trust management, but typically do not support dynamic changes of the underlying trust domains. To cover this gap, in this paper, we present a novel hierarchical multi expressive blockchain architecture. At the top layer, a proxy blockchain enables independently managed trust authorities to interoperate. End-users from different health care domains, such as hospitals or device manufacturers are able to access and securely exchange medical data, provided that a commonly agreed domain-wise access policy is enforced. At the bottom layer, one or more domain blockchains allow each domain (e.g. a hospital or device manufacturer) to enforce their policy and allow fine-grained access control with attribute-based encryption. This architecture is designed to provide the autonomous management of trusted medical data/devices and the transactions of mutually untrusted stakeholders, as well as an inherent forensics mechanism tailored for granular auditing. Smart contracts are used to enforce decentralized policies. Ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) is used to distribute the decryption process among end users and the system, as well as support an efficient credential revocation mechanism. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture through a proof of concept implementation. Finally we analyse the major security and performance characteristics. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The new 'status quo' created by the emerging integration of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructures, combined with the openness of the 5G service market, have set new standards on how the multitude of 5G service domains should be incentivized and coordinated to comply with the performance requirements set on a per session basis. In this paper, we revisit the predominant offline contract-driven mobile data access model enabling users to gain access to the infrastructure of only a few network operators and propose a new blockchain-backed mobile data access model where the key 5G stakeholders can trade, share and consume mobile edge network assets (access to the internet, spectrum, processing, storage, local content etc.) in a fully decentralized, anonymous and highly-robust fashion. Blockchain-backed mobile data access should address critical practical challenges of blockchain decentralization, scalability and security in the context of 5G and Beyond networks. Accordingly, we provide a meticulous survey of existing solutions in the aforementioned three areas and present a comprehensive holistic framework of protocols to address the key challenges identified, including a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for distributed blockchain consensus over 5G and Beyond mobile data networks, a future-proof smart-contract enabled payment relay service enabling instant off-chain payments in a highly robust fashion as well as a hybrid mixing protocol that enables payment relays to act as anonymous payment hubs while addressing the unique challenges opposed by the joint blockchain and network level interaction of the 5G and Beyond service components. A wide range of practical implications and mitigation measures for dishonest operation of the blockchain nodes are investigated and sophisticated yet highly-robust incentive engineering mechanisms are derived. Detailed numerical results also accompany the paper, bringing to light the unique performance trade-offs and valuable design guidelines towards blockchain-backed mobile data access for 5G and Beyond mobile data networks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, various food-safety issues have aroused public concern regarding safety in the food supply chain. Since grains are closely linked to human life and health, it is necessary to effectively manage information in the grain supply chain. The grain supply chain is characterized by a long life cycle, complex links, various hazards, and heterogeneous information sources. Problems with traditional traceability systems include easy data tampering, difficult hazardous-material information management, the 'information isolated island' problem, and low traceability efficiency in the whole supply chain. Blockchain is a distributed computing paradigm characterized by decentralization, network-wide recording, security, and reliability. As such, it can reduce administrative costs and improve the efficiency of information management. Based on literature research and a field investigation of wheat-processing enterprises in Shandong Province, We analyze the operation process of grain supply chain. This study, therefore, proposed a new system architecture in the entire grain supply chain based on blockchain technology and designed a multimode storage mechanism that combines chain storage. This prototype system was tested and verified using actual cases and application scenarios. Compared to traditional systems, the proposed system is characterized by data security and reliability, information interconnection and intercommunication, real-time sharing of hazardous-material information, and dynamic and credible whole-process tracing. As such, this system is highly significant and has reference value for guaranteeing food quality and safety-process traceability. © 2013 IEEE.},

These networks are designed to provide strict Quality of Service (QoS) compliance independently of the network conditions in each use case. Some use cases are deployed in Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), infrastructures that are managed by mobile network operators. However, for other use cases, devices are connected to services in private networks named Non-Public Networks (NPNs). Network slicing is the 5G concept that addresses the compliance of multiple services requirements on the same network by virtualizing the physical network infrastructure. Network Slices (NSs) are created to manage the different requirements above and to ensure coexistence between these different requirements. In this work, we avail from network slicing concept to create a solution for NPNs in e-health environments which maintains QoS and privacy requirements among slices. Moreover, we also propose a blockchain mechanism to secure the NS management layer. This mechanism ensures data integrity and reliability for the NSs settings. We validate our approach by demonstrating our comprehensive solution to secure e-health environments sensitive data and the management of the slices by the e-health environments.

	abstract = {Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We conduct three design cycles and develop three artefacts: a BPO, a BPD, and a BPRE approach.

Current practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which increase maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy concerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important to design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data efficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a novel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image management (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient private data without using a centralized infrastructure. In this system, we employed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system technology called Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an Ethereum smart contract called the patient-centric access control protocol to enable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the means for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility. We describe how the PCIM system architecture facilitates the distributed and secured patient-centric data access across multiple entities such as hospitals, patients, and image requestors. Finally, we deployed a smart contract prototype on an Ethereum testnet blockchain and evaluated the proposed framework within the Windows environment. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Data sharing among distributed medical institutions is already a development trend. However, the security is worrying; e.g., the access to medical data lacks uniformity and standardization.

Therefore, a strict and reliable access control mechanism for data in the medical cyber physical systems is a prerequisite for ensuring the implementation of modern medical functions. We deal with how to design effective access control in medical cyber physical systems. Combined with blockchain technology, we design the medical cyber physical systems based on blockchain data access control mechanism and unite data in the chain of union Fabric network resources access control. We qualitatively classify medical data, define the weight level of different data, design a medical data access framework based on blockchain, build an applicable model, formulate access control strategy, and specify the role assignment and access task matching of users, so as to achieve secure and effective data access control.

	abstract = {Internet of things IoT is playing a remarkable role in the advancement of many fields such as healthcare, smart grids, supply chain management, etc. It also eases people's daily lives and enhances their interaction with each other as well as with their surroundings and the environment in a broader scope. IoT performs this role utilizing devices and sensors of different shapes and sizes ranging from small embedded sensors and wearable devices all the way to automated systems. However, IoT networks are growing in size, complexity, and number of connected devices. As a result, many challenges and problems arise such as security, authenticity, reliability, and scalability. Based on that and taking into account the anticipated evolution of the IoT, it is extremely vital not only tomaintain but to increase confidence in and reliance on IoT systems by tackling the aforementioned issues. The emergence of blockchain opened the door to solve some challenges related to IoT networks. Blockchain characteristics such as security, transparency, reliability, and traceability make it the perfect candidate to improve IoT systems, solve their problems, and support their future expansion. This paper demonstrates the major challenges facing IoT systems and blockchain's proposed rolein solving them. It also evaluates the position of current researches in the field of merging blockchain with IoT networks and the latest implementation stages. Additionally, it discusses the issuesrelated to the IoT-blockchain integration itself. Finally, this research proposes an architectural design to integrate IoT with blockchain in two layers using dew and cloudlet computing. Our aim is to benefit from blockchain features and services to guarantee a decentralized data storage and processing and address security and anonymity challenges and achieve transparency and efficient authentication service.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts (SCs) and collaborative learning (CL) are disclosed publicly, in which most transactions and activities that occur by the parties can be bared in real-time. Both are strengthened in a decentralized manner. CL allows numerous clients to collectively build deep learning models privately by aggregating the gradient values from clients' devices, yet it lacks the incentive mechanism for the contributing clients. On the other hand, the merits of SCs can be a plausible solution as an incentive mechanism in the CL system because self-executing contracts with immutable data records are resistant to failure. The clients can claim the rewards by stating their contribution arbitrarily in the SCs and tendering a proof transaction function. Nevertheless, directly adopting SCs in the CL system could breach clients' privacy because the transactions are exposed openly. The observer can infer the properties of the clients' resources. Therefore, we designed schemes that can overcome observers' ability to link clients' information with their associated devices during training. In essence, our schemes are unbiased. We also provide a secure incentive mechanism for the parties in the CL system by obscuring the information values. Finally, the numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes satisfy the design goals.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emerging of cloud data sharing can create great values, especially in multi-cloud environments. However, "data island"between different cloud service providers (CSPs) has drawn trust problem in data sharing, causing contradictions with the increasing sharing need of cloud data users. And how to ensure the data value for both data owner and data user before sharing, is another challenge limiting massive data sharing in the multi-cloud environments. To solve the problems above, we propose a Uniform Encoding and Parsing Framework (UEPF) with blockchain to support trustworthy and valuable data sharing. We design namespace-based unique identifier pair to support data description corresponding with data in multi-cloud, and build a blockchain-based data encoding protocol to manage the metadata with identifier pair in the blockchain ledger. To share data in multi-cloud, we build a data parsing protocol with smart contract to query and get the sharing cloud data efficiently. We also build identifier updating protocol to satisfy the dynamicity of data, and data check protocol to ensure the validity of data. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that UEPF is pretty efficient.  © 2021 KSII.},

	abstract = {The current Distribution Grid Automation (DGA) Systems are being heavily dependent on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for its proper operation. The DGA architectures are predominantly centralized and usually deployed on a dedicated hardware. This increases the risk of blackouts under a coordinated cyber-physical attack. The compromise of the dedicated hardware that hosts the central coordinator of the DGA automation results in a blackout. Though many countermeasures have already been proposed for tackling different types cyber and physical attacks on the ICT infrastructure, very few measures have been proposed to ensure the availability of the grid operation functions, even when it is compromised. This study proposes an automatic, distributed approach based on Blockchain and Smart Contract that ensures the availability of the core DGA functions even if the central coordinator that operates the grid is compromised. This is done by virtualizing and migrating/re-initialising these functions from the dedicated hardware that was compromised to another. Additionally, a Multi-Attribute Decision Making based method is incorporated into the Smart Contract that helps in selection of the optimal hardware that can host the function considering its limitations (hardware and software). Finally, a proof of concept implementation of the proposed solution is presented that utilizes the Calvin IoT (Internet of Things) platform, Flow programming tool and Hyperledger fabric and its performance is evaluated. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {It is undisputable fact that Coronavirus pandemic will go into the annals of history as one of the devastating plagues. From the healthcare perspective, a lot of efforts are underway geared towards testing, management and vaccination whereas industry and research communities explore innovative solutions. Quite a number of solutions have emerged zooming in on contact tracing, combating misinformation, data aggregation and analysis as well as test result certification with blockchain technology been the core. Aside the reliance on centralized architectures and use of permissioned/consortium blockchain, conspicuously missing in existing solutions based on blockchain is the work around the immutability feature of the technology given the fact that a person's test result is not static but dynamic. In this paper, we propose a solution using blockchain and smart contract that allows for state changes to be made by authorized entities. We leverage distributed storage technology using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storage of user encrypted records and subsequent retrieval for verification purposes. We extend our solution by incorporating vaccination status to provide comprehensive source of information and show proof of concept.

	abstract = {The global implementation architecture of the traditional stock market distributes responsibilities and data across different intermediaries, including financial and governmental organizations. Each organization manages its system and collaborates with the others to facilitate trading on the stock exchange platform, and typically buy-sell orders go through different parties before settlement. This design architecture that involves a complex chain of intermediaries has several limitations and shortcomings, such as a single point of failure, a longer time for financial settlements, and weak transparency. Blockchain technology consists of a network of computer nodes that securely share a common ledger without the need of having any kind of intermediaries. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based architecture for a fully decentralized stock market. Our architecture is based on a private Ethereum blockchain to create a consortium network leveraging organizations that are already involved in the traditional stock exchange to act as validating nodes. In our architecture, the stock exchange trading logic is completely implemented on a smart contract, while considering the existing governmental market regulations. Since the new platform does not introduce significant changes to the stock exchange trading logic and does not eliminate any of the traditional parties from the system, our proposal promotes efficient adoption and deployment of decentralized stock exchange platforms. In addition, we present a proof of concept implementation of the new architecture, including the smart contract for trade exchange, as well as a virtualization-based test network to assess the platform performance. The test network consists of virtual nodes that run the developed stock exchange smart contract where we measure the buy-sell orders throughput and latency under different network sizes and trading workload scenarios. The obtained results have shown that the proposed trading platform can reach a throughput of 311.8 tx/sec, which is equivalent to 89% of the optimal throughput when the sending rate is 350 tx/sec. This throughput is largely sufficient to meet the requirement of major stock exchanges, such as Singapore stock market.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We formalize a general definition of reentrancy and introduce a security condition that allows software modules like smart contracts to protect their key invariants while retaining the expressive power of safe forms of reentrancy. We present a security type system that provably enforces secure information flow; in conjunction with run-time mechanisms, it enforces secure reentrancy even in the presence of unknown code; and it helps locate and correct recent high-profile vulnerabilities. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are self-enforcing agreements that are employed to exchange assets without the approval of trusted third parties. This feature has encouraged various sectors to make use of smart contracts when transacting. Experience shows that many deployed contracts are vulnerable to exploitation due to their poor design, which allows attackers to steal valuable assets from the involved parties. Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are immutable, verifiable, and autonomous pieces of code that can be deployed and ran on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Due to the immutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart contract or a verified transaction. On the other hand, there are millions of dollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty smart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for smart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code before deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing mechanism for smart contracts in the Solidity language, based on mutation testing. We analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts and designed 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our experimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate 10 out of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of dollars loss. We also have extended the Universal Mutator tool with our mutation operators to generate mutants for smart contracts written in Solidity, automatically. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize manufacturing industries. For example, several supply chain use cases may benefit from transparent asset tracking and automated processes using smart contracts. Several real-world deployments exist where the transparency aspect of a blockchain is both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time. The exposure of assets and business interaction represent critical risks. However, there are typically no confidentiality guarantees to protect the smart contract logic as well as the processed data. Trusted execution environments (TEE) are an emerging technology available in both edge or mobile-grade processors (e.g., ARM TrustZone) and server-grade processors (e.g., Intel SGX). TEEs shield both code and data from malicious attackers. This practical experience report presents TZ4FABRIC, an extension of Hyperledger Fabric to leverage ARM TrustZone for the secure execution of smart contracts. Our design minimizes the trusted computing base executed by avoiding the execution of a whole Hyperledger Fabric node inside the TEE, which continues to run in untrusted environment. Instead, we restrict it to the execution of only the smart contract. The TZ4FABRIC prototype exploits the opensource OP-TEE framework, as it supports deployments on cheap low-end devices (e.g., Raspberry Pis). Our experimental results highlight the performance trade-off due to the additional security guarantees provided by ARM TrustZone. TZ4FABRIC will be released as open source.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract-enabled blockchains allow building decentralized applications in which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle services emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds. Unfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under what is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side and showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered collaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart contract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative attack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all previous works required a technique to quantify an attacker’s individual contribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our framework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless collaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the attack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform the attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers’ interaction as a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in proportion to the amount of their bets in the game’s unique equilibrium. We also model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and prove that it is a strategy-proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchanges. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate new large-scale production blockchains. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

As these robots become increasingly adept at parsing through enormous datasets and making decisions where humans fall short, a significant challenge lies in the analysis of robot behavior. Capturing interactions between robots, humans and IoT devices in traditional structures such as graphs poses challenges in the storage and analysis of large data sets in dense graphs generated by frequent activities. This paper proposes a framework that uses the blockchain for the storage of robotic interactions, and the use of sheaf theory for analysis of these interactions. Applications of our framework for social robots and swarm robots incorporating imperfect information and irrationality on the blockchain sheaf are proposed. This work shows the application of such a framework for various blockchain applications on the spectrum of human-robot interaction, and identifies key challenges that arise as a result of using the blockchain for robotic applications. © Copyright © 2021 Murimi.},

However, traditional DNS architecture is centralized, and there are some security problems such as the right concentration and power abuse.

At first, this paper designs a top-level domain chain (TLDChain) model to conduct consensus on block transactions and achieve decentralization of domain name service. Then, this paper introduces a data model to upload data. At the same time, to improve the efficiency of the blockchain data query, this paper proposes a data warehouse to speed up the query. Also, it designs the domain name data synchronization algorithm and consistency checking algorithm to achieve synchronization and quick consistency checking of domain name data. At last, this paper introduces the domain name resolution process of this model. Experimental results show that the proposed DNS service model not only realizes the decentralization of domain name resolution but also improves query efficiency. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

Our starting point is the logic-based programming language for smart contracts used in a recently proposed framework of quantum-secured blockchain, called Logicontract (LC).We then extend the logic used in LC by answer set programming (ASP), a modern approach to declarative logic programming. Using ASP enables us to write various interesting smart contracts, such as conditional payment, commitment, multi-party lottery and legal service. A striking feature of our ASP implementation proposal is that it involves post-quantum cryptographic primitives, such as the lattice-based public key encryption and signature. The adoption of the post-quantum cryptographic signature overcomes a specific limitation of LC in which the unconditionally secure signature, despite its strength, offers limited protection for users of the same node. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchain software development is becoming more and more important for any modern software developer and IT startup. Nonetheless, blockchain software production still lacks a disciplined, organized and mature development process, as demonstrated by the many and (in)famous failures and frauds occurred in recent years. In this paper we present ABCDE, a complete method addressing blockchain software development. The method considers the software integration among the blockchain components—smart contracts, libraries, data structures—and the out-of-chain components, such as web or mobile applications, which all together constitute a complete DApp system. We advocate for ABCDE the use of agile practices, because these are suited to develop systems whose requirements are not completely understood since the beginning, or tend to change, as it is the case of most blockchain-based applications. ABCDE is based on Scrum, and is therefore iterative and incremental. From Scrum, we kept the requirement gathering with user stories, the iterative-incremental approach, the key roles, and the meetings. The main difference with Scrum is the separation of development activities in two flows—one for smart contracts and the other for out-of-chain software interacting with the blockchain—each performed iteratively, with integration activities every 2–3 iterations. ABCDE makes explicit the activities that must be performed to design, develop, test and integrate smart contracts and out-of-chain software, and documents the smart contracts using formal diagrams to help development, security assessment, and maintenance. A diagram derived from UML class diagram helps to effectively model the data structure of smart contracts, whereas the exchange of messages between the entities of the system is modeled using a modified UML sequence diagram. The proposed method has also specific activities for security assessment and gas optimization, through systematic use of patterns and checklists. ABCDE focuses on Ethereum blockchain and its Solidity language, but preserves generality and with proper modifications might be applied to any blockchain software project. ABCDE method is described in detail, and an example is given to show how to concretely implement the various development steps. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The combination of renewable energy sources and prosumer-based smart grid is a sustainable solution to cater to the problem of energy demand management. A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices. © 2021 by the authors.

The model explicitly accounts for the immutability of the trustless, append-only, and decentralized DLT ecosystem, and thereby overcomes certain limitations of traditional software engineering process models. More specifically, it consists of five successive and closely intertwined phases: conceptualization, implementation, approval, execution, and finalization. For each phase, the respective activities, roles, and artifacts are identified and discussed in detail. Applying such a model when engineering smart contracts will help software engineers and developers to better understand and streamline the engineering process of DLTs in general and blockchain in particular. Furthermore, this model serves as a generic framework which will support application development in all fields in which DLT can be applied. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The idea of a shared economy becomes one of the companies as an enterprise type. Especially with the advanced development of digital smart devices and the internet, several forms of the mutual economy have been advanced in accord with the need for sharing of separate income. Shareable commodity and digital content are also seeking to utilize. When digital content is used as a sharing economy, various possible threats may arise in the course of transactions, the potential for theft, alteration, and hacking of contents. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of Blockchain. Blockchain promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. In this research, we proposed a content protection and transaction method using Blockchain Ethereum Technology. The encryption algorithm is incorporated in proposed system to make transparent transactions and it is also implemented on content itself to prevent from smart forgery and hacking. The experimental results signify that the proposed method has strong potential to enhance transactions transparency by minimizing the security threats in digital content transactions. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rise of programmable open distributed consensus platforms based on the blockchain technology has aroused a lot of interest in replicated stateful computations, aka smart contracts. As blockchains are used predominantly in financial applications, smart contracts frequently manage millions of dollars worth of virtual coins. Since smart contracts cannot be updated once deployed, the ability to reason about their correctness becomes a critical task. Yet, the de facto implementation standard, pioneered by the Ethereum platform, dictates smart contracts to be deployed in a low-level language, which renders independent audit and formal verification of deployed code infeasible in practice. We report an ongoing experiment held with an industrial blockchain vendor on designing, evaluating, and deploying Scilla, a new programming language for safe smart contracts. Scilla is positioned as an intermediate-level language, suitable to serve as a compilation target and also as an independent programming framework. Taking System F as a foundational calculus, Scilla offers strong safety guarantees by means of type soundness. It provides a clean separation between pure computational, state-manipulating, and communication aspects of smart contracts, avoiding many known pitfalls due to execution in a byzantine environment. We describe the motivation, design principles, and semantics of Scilla, and we report on Scilla use cases provided by the developer community. Finally, we present a framework for lightweight verification of Scilla programs, and showcase it with two domain-specific analyses on a suite of real-world use cases. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Obsidian is a new typestate-oriented programming language that uses a strong type system to rule out some of these vulnerabilities. Although Obsidian was designed to promote usability to make it as easy as possible to write programs, strong type systems can cause a language to be difficult to use. In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to provide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular languages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today. We observed that Obsidian participants were able to successfully complete more of the programming tasks than the Solidity participants. We also found that the Solidity participants commonly inserted asset-related bugs, which Obsidian detects at compile time. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

So far, most existing solutions focus on an honest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. A few recent works have attempted to construct verifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on specific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general verification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes. In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the potential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain environments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and efficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of SSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to search keywords in shared documents. We implement prototypes of our two designs and present experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of our decentralized SSE schemes.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 is a severe global epidemic in human history. Even though there are particular medications and vaccines to curb the epidemic, tracing and isolating the infection source is the best option to slow the virus spread and reduce infection and death rates. There are three disadvantages to the existing contact tracing system: 1. User data is stored in a centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with, 2. User's confidential personal identity may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3. Existing contact tracing systems [1][2] only focus on information sharing from one dimension, such as location-based tracing, which significantly limits the effectiveness of such systems.We propose a global COVID-19 information sharing and risk notification system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth. To protect user privacy, we design a novel Blockchain-based platform that can share consistent and non-tampered contact tracing information from multiple dimensions, such as location-based for indirect contact and Bluetooth-based for direct contact. Hierarchical smart contract architecture is also designed to achieve global agreements from users about how to process and utilize user data, thereby enhancing the data usage transparency. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to protect user identity privacy from multiple aspects. More importantly, our system can notify the users about the exposure risk via smart contracts. We implement a prototype system to conduct extensive measurements to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, blockchain proposals are being adopted to solve security issues, such as data integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation. To improve certain aspects, e.g., energy consumption and latency, of traditional blockchains, different architectures, algorithms, and data management methods have been recently proposed. For example, appendable-block blockchain uses a different data structure designed to reduce latency in block and transaction insertion. It is especially applicable in domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), where both latency and energy are key concerns. However, the lack of some features available to other blockchains, such as Smart Contracts, limits the application of this model. To solve this, in this work, we propose the use of Smart Contracts in appendable-block blockchain through a new model called context-based appendable-block blockchain. This model also allows the execution of multiple smart contracts in parallel, featuring high performance in parallel computing scenarios. Furthermore, we present an implementation for the context-based appendable-block blockchain using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Finally, we execute this implementation in four different testbed. The results demonstrated a performance improvement for parallel processing of smart contracts when using the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.},

It is expected as a promising solution to tackle sophisticated challenges on personal data management, thanks to its advanced features such as immutability, decentralisation and transparency. Although certain approaches have been proposed to address technical difficulties in personal data management; most of them only provided preliminary methodological exploration. Alarmingly, when utilising Blockchain for developing a personal data management system, fictions have occurred in existing approaches and been promulgated in the literature. Such fictions are theoretically doable; however, by thoroughly breaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we clarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly inefficient due to the natural limitations of the blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution in which such fictions are reduced by designing a novel system architecture with a blockchain-based 'proof of permission' protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing service built on top of a public blockchain platform. We believe that our research resolves existing ambiguity and take a step further on providing a practically feasible solution for decentralised personal data management. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A smart contract honeypot is a special type of smart contract. This type of contract seems to have obvious vulnerabilities in contract design. If a user transfers a certain amount of funds to the contract, then the user can withdraw the funds in the contract. However, once users try to take advantage of this seemingly obvious vulnerability, they will fall into a real trap. Consequently, the user's investment in the contract cannot be retrieved. The honeypot induces other accounts to launch funds, which seriously threatens the security of property on the blockchain. Detection methods for honeypots are available. However, studying the manner by which to defend existing honeypots is insufficient to fight against honeypots. The new honeypots that may appear in the future from the perspective of an attacker must also be predicted. Therefore, we propose a type of adversarial honeypot. The code and behavioral features of honeypots are obtained through a comparative analysis of the 158,568 non-honeypots and 352 honeypots. To build an adversarial honeypot, we try to separately hide these features and make the honeypot bypass the existing detection technology. We construct 18 instances on the basis of the proposed adversarial honeypot and use an open-source honeypot detection tool to detect these instances. The experimental result shows that the proposed honeypot can bypass the detection tool with a 100% ratio. Therefore, this type of honeypot should be given attention, and defensive measures should be proposed as soon as possible. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Service providers usually require detailed statistics in order to improve their services. On the other hand, privacy concerns are intensifying and sensitive data is protected by legislation, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a marketplace that allows “data consumers” to buy information from “data providers”, which can then be used for generating meaningful statistics. Additionally, our system enables “system operators” that can select which data providers are allowed to provide data, based on filtering criteria specified by the data consumer. We leverage local differential privacy to protect the data provider's privacy against data consumers, as well as against system operators, and we build a blockchain-based solution for ensuring fair exchange, and immutable data logs. Our design targets use cases that involve hundreds or even thousands of data providers. We prove the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of concept implementation of a measurement sharing application for smart-grid systems. © 2021 The Authors},

Many edge cloud-based system designs have been proposed, but some technical challenges still remain, such as low quality of services (QoS), data privacy and system security due to centralized healthcare architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach of data offloading and data sharing for healthcare using edge cloud and blockchain. First, an efficient data offloading scheme is proposed where IoT health data can be offloaded to nearby edge servers for data processing with privacy awareness. Then, a data sharing scheme is integrated to enable data exchange among healthcare users via blockchain. Particularly, a trustworthy access control mechanism is developed using smart contracts for access authentication to achieve secure EHRs sharing. Implementation results from extensive real-world experiments show the superior advantages of the proposal over the existing schemes in terms of improved QoS, enhanced data privacy and security, and low smart contract costs.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Security and privacy issues have become a rapidly growing problem with the fast development of big data in public health. However, big data faces many ongoing serious challenges in the process of collection, storage, and use. Among them, data security and privacy problems have attracted extensive interest. In an effort to overcome this challenge, this article aims to present a distributed privacy preservation approach based on smart contracts and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). First of all, we define SGX as a trusted edge computing node, design data access module, data protection module, and data integrity check module, to achieve hardware-enhanced data privacy protection. Then, we design a smart contract framework to realize distributed data access control management in a big data environment. The crucial role of the smart contract was revealed by designing multiple access control contracts, register contracts, and history contracts. Access control contracts provide access control methods for different users and enable static access verification and dynamic access verification by checking the user's properties and history behavior. Register contract contains user property information, edge computing node information, the access control and history smart contract information, and provides functions such as registration, update, and deletion. History contract records the historical behavior information of malicious users, receives the report information of malicious requestors from the access control contract, implements a misbehavior check method to determines whether the requestor has misbehavior, and returns the corresponding result. Finally, we design decentralized system architecture, prove the security properties, and analysis to verify the feasibility of the system. Results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the timeliness of data, reduce network latency, and ensure the security, reliability, and traceability of data. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new clean-slate architecture for the future Internet. Efficient content retrieval is the original intention of NDN design. The content retrieval process driven by content consumers in NDN includes the following challenges, consumers do not know whether the content exists and whether the content producer is reliable. Invalid interest packets could cause the occupation of limited network resources and DoS attack problem. To ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data packets, consumers need to pre-configure the trust schema, which is centralized and prone to the single point of failure problem. Blockchain has widespread attention to build trust in a distributed way, and Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, a decentralized smart contract platform. To lighten the burden of consumers, we proposed a Smart Contract-based Trusted Content Retrieval Mechanism (SCTCRM) for NDN in this paper. The mechanism contains a trustworthy information base for content and producers based on smart contracts, and provides content retrieval and name resolution services for content consumers. The purpose of this mechanism is to improve the efficiency and security of content retrieval process. We described the framework and the workflow of SCTCRM, and used Colored Petri Nets to create a formal mathematical model and analyze the security of the mechanism. Finally, the cost of storage and Gas in smart contracts are evaluated through the prototype deployment. From the results, we can see that the proposed mechanism is security and practicality. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Companies increasingly tender knowledge-intensive tasks using crowdsourcing platforms to gain access to scarce knowledge and skills otherwise out of reach, and in this way, gaining competitive advantage. Despite its potential, existing crowdsourcing platforms encounter several challenges, including (1) fragmentation of expertise, as there are many platforms, (2) distrust between task providers and crowdsourcing participants, as identity and past performance are often not known, and (3) inability to learn from experience due to a lack of openness. A reference architecture for blockchain-based knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing platforms to mediate transactions between demand and supply of knowledge is designed in this paper to overcome these challenges. A design science research method is followed to develop the architecture. The reference architecture shows how blockchain and smart contract components can be integrated to support and coordinate knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing activities. By removing traditional e-commerce intermediaries, blockchain reduces search friction, knowledge transfer costs, and cheating by task providers or crowdsourcing participants. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Data marketplaces (DMs) promote the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities. To facilitate the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications, it is required to provide scalable, interoperable, and secured services for large numbers of distributed IoT devices operated by different application vendors. Thanks to decentralization, immutability, and auditability, Blockchain is promising to enable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and security issues in centralized DMs. However, directly integrating blockchains into large-scale IoT-based DMs still faces many limitations, such as high resource and energy demands, low transaction throughput, poor scalability, and challenges in privacy preservation. This paper introduces a novel Federated Ledgers-based Framework for Hierarchical Decentralized Data Marketplaces (Fed-DDM). In Fed-DDM, participants are divided into multiple permissioned domains given their registrations. Each domain leverages an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to commit transactions of a domain on a private intra-ledger. A public inter-ledger network adopts a scalable Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to federate multiple private intra-ledger networks. We design a smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol to guarantee the security of the cross-domain operations on a public federated ledger without exposing sensitive privacy information from private ledgers. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed Fed-DDM solution with performance and security guarantees. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) are nowadays an important field of applications thanks to the recent surge in online interaction. However, the illegal disclosure of user's private data can cause damaging consequences and even threaten the safety of users' life. The privacy issues of OSNs have become a matter of great concern for many people. In recent years, there are some research works to address this privacy issue, yet they do not always focus on providing the normal social network services for users, such as data sharing, data retrieval and data access services. Therefore, it is a challenge to ensure the security of sensitive data while providing efficient and privacy-preserving social network services for users. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving framework for online social networks, called BPP. Combined blockchain and public-key cryptography technique, the BPP framework can achieve secure data sharing, data retrieving, and data accessing with fairness and without worrying about potential damage to users' interest. Specifically, based on blockchain and public key encryption with keyword search technique, a secure, fair and efficient keyword search algorithm is proposed, with which the BBP framework realises privacy preservation of user's query and then obtain accurate query results with assurance and without needing for any further verification operation in online social network. Finally, we implement a prototype of our framework and deploy it to a locally simulated network. The extensive experiments and security analysis demonstrate the security, efficacy and efficiency of our proposed framework. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts have sought to design new smart contract programming languages that make writing blockchain programs safer. But programs on the blockchain are beholden only to the safety properties enforced by the blockchain itself: even the strictest language-only properties can be rendered moot on a language-oblivious blockchain due to inter-contract interactions. Consequently, while safer languages are a necessity, fully realizing their benefits necessitates a language-aware redesign of the blockchain itself. To this end, we propose that the blockchain be viewed as a typechain: a chain of typed programs-not arbitrary blocks-that are included iff they typecheck against the existing chain. Reaching consensus, or blockchecking, validates typechecking in a byzantine fault-tolerant manner. Safety properties traditionally enforced by a runtime are instead enforced by a type system with the aim of statically capturing smart contract correctness. To provide a robust level of safety, we contend that a typechain must minimally guarantee (1) asset linearity and liveness, (2) physical resource availability, including CPU and memory, (3) exceptionless execution, or no early termination, (4) protocol conformance, or adherence to some state machine, and (5) inter-contract safety, including reentrancy safety. Despite their exacting nature, typechains are extensible, allowing for rich libraries that extend the set of verified properties. We expand on typechain properties and present examples of real-world bugs they prevent.  © 2020 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {The conventional architecture of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with a centralized approach has difficulty overcoming the increasing complexity of intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications as well as challenges in providing large amounts of data storage, trust management, and information security. Therefore, vehicular edge computing networks (VECNets) have emerged to provide massive storage resources with powerful computing on network edges. However, a centralized server in VECNets is insufficient due to potential data leakage and security risks as it can still allow a single point of failure (SPoF). We propose consortium blockchain and smart contracts to ensure a trustworthy environment for secure data storage and sharing in the system to address these challenges. Practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is utilized because it is suitable for consortium blockchain to audit publicly, store data sharing, and records the whole consensus process. It can defend against system failures with or without symptoms to reach an agreement among consensus participants. Furthermore, we use an incentive mechanism to motivate the vehicle to contribute and honestly share their data. The simulation results satisfy the proposed model’s design goals by increasing vehicular networks’ performance in general. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {As blockchain technology booms, modern electronic voting system leverages blockchain as underlying storage model to make the voting process more transparent, and guarantee immutability of data. However, the transparent characteristic may disclose sensitive information of candidate for all system users have the same right to their information. Besides that, the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain will lead to the disclosure of voters’ privacy and the third-parties such as registration institutions involved in voting process also have possibility of tampering data. To overcome these difficulties, we apply authority management mechanism into blockchain-based voting systems. In this paper, we put forward AMVchain, a fully decentralized and efficient blockchain-based voting system. AMVchain has a three-layer access control architecture, and on each layer, smart contracts are responsible for validation and granting permissions. Linkable ring signature is adopted in the process of voting to protect ballot-privacy. AMVchain also makes a tradeoff between efficiency and concurrency by introducing proxy nodes.

	abstract = {Advanced wireless technology in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing and facing various security threats. The authentication of IoT devices is the first line of defense for the wireless network. Especially in a Wi-Fi network, the existing authentication methods mainly use a password or digital certificate, these methods are inconvenient to manage due to certificate issuance or prone to be attacked because passwords are easily cracked. In this paper, we propose a location-aware authentication scheme using smart contracts to ensure that IoT devices can securely perform Wi-Fi network authentication. The scheme adopts the concept of secondary authentication and consists of two phases: the registration phase, which is mainly designed to complete the generation of the public and private keys, and to link the device information with its related device information; the authentication phase, which is mainly designed to determine whether the requesting device is within a legal location range. We use the smart contract to ensure the credibility and irreparability of the authentication process. Analysis of the attack model and the attacks at different stages proves that this certification scheme is assured, and the simulation results show that the overhead introduced by this scheme is acceptable, this scheme can provide greater security for the Wi-Fi authentication of IoT devices. © 2020 by the authors.

Towards this goal, we study various syntactic and semantic characteristics of loops used in over 20,000 Solidity contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, with the goal of informing future research on program analysis for smart contracts. Based on our findings, we propose a small domain-specific language (DSL) that can be used to summarize common looping patterns in Solidity. To evaluate what percentage of smart contract loops can be expressed in our proposed DSL, we also design and implement a program synthesis toolchain called Solis that can synthesize loop summaries in our DSL. Our evaluation shows that at least 56% of the analyzed loops can be summarized in our DSL, and 81% of these summaries are exactly equivalent to the original loop. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {The creative introduction of the smart contracts in Ethereum, which are Turing-complete programs, boosted blockchain to the second generation. Meantime, the specifically designed young and fast-evolving programming languages, such as Solidity, become the key factors behind smart contracts being the breeding ground of ubiquitous defects. As many contract defects occur within certain compiler versions, knowing the specific compiler version used to generate the contract's bytecode, facilitates the design of more targeted defect detection approaches, and provides ways to estimate the risks faced of invoking it. To this end, we propose VSmart (compiler Version identification for Smart contract), which takes in the bytecode of the smart contract to be analyzed and outputs the major compiler version used to produce it. The basic idea is to leverage deep neural networks to grasp version-indicative features from contracts' normalized opcode sequences, and train classifiers on a data set consisting of 131,546 smart contracts with ground-truth labels we collected from Etherscan. The performance evaluation conducted shows that VSmart achieves nearly 98% accuracy in identifying major Solidity compiler versions. Further, on the basis of VSmart, we perform an empirical study on the distribution of the Solidity compiler versions on a wild data set consisting of 15,326,672 nontrivial smart contracts actually deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The landscape estimation results show that the Solidity version distribution is rather imbalanced, with Solidity 0.4 being the most popular one; and the developers' Solidity usage practices conflict with the official's suggestion of always using the latest version, while they tend to gradually switch to newer versions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

The emergence of distributed OSNs (DOSNs) can solve this privacy issue, yet they bring inefficiencies in providing the main functionalities, such as access control and data availability. In this article, in view of the above-mentioned challenges encountered in OSNs and DOSNs, we exploit the emerging blockchain technique to design a new DOSN framework that integrates the advantages of both traditional centralized OSNs and DOSNs. By combining smart contracts, we use the blockchain as a trusted server to provide central control services. Meanwhile, we separate the storage services so that users have complete control over their data.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing technology, cloud services have now become a new business model for information services. The cloud server provides the IT resources required by customers in a self-service manner through the network, realizing business expansion and rapid innovation. However, due to the insufficient protection of data privacy, the problem of data privacy leakage in cloud storage is threatening cloud computing. To address the problem, we propose BC-PECK, a data protection scheme based on blockchain and public key searchable encryption. Firstly, all the data is protected by the encryption algorithm. The privacy data is encrypted and stored in a cloud server, while the ciphertext index is established by a public key searchable encryption scheme and stored on the blockchain. Secondly, based on the characteristics of trusted execution of smart contract technology, a control mechanism for data accessing and sharing is given. Data transaction is automatically recorded on the blockchain, which is fairer under the premise of ensuring the privacy and security of the data sharing process. Finally, we analyzed the security and fairness of the current scheme. Through the comparison with similar schemes, we have shown the advantages of the proposed scheme. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {With the development of communication 5G networks and technologies, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce. The scarcity of the spectrum resource makes market-driven spectrum auction become an important means of spectrum allocation, and due to the complexity of the network environment, the security of spectrum auctions can not be ignored. Most existing secure spectrum auction schemes introduce a semi-honest agent to complete spectrum auction. However, the hypothetical semi-honest model does not guarantee the security of spectrum auction in the actual application scenario, which may lead to potential security threats: the agent may reveal the privacy of bidders, agent or auctioneer may collude with the bidder to manipulate the spectrum auction, and so on. In this paper, a secure spectrum auction scheme without a trusted party is proposed based on the smart contract technology, and the smart contract written into the blockchain replaces the traditional semi-honest agent to cooperate with the auctioneer server to complete the auction. In order to ensure the security of our scheme, a secure spectrum auction protocol is designed, in which the Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and Paillier cryptosystem are used to protect the privacy of bidders. Public verification is provided in our protocol by using extensive Pedersen commitment, which prevents the auctioneer server and the bidder from colluding with each other and verifies group bid sum values. Finally, the security analysis is given to propose several types of attacks that can be defended. Besides, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of our protocol are also provided. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

Exchange happens off-chain, but the status update takes place on-chain. The exchange can be verified but with a cost. To guarantee self-enforcement of the smart contract, both parties make a deposit, and the deposits must cover payments made in all possible final states. Both parties have an (opportunity) cost of making deposits. We discuss two classes of contract: In the first, the mechanism only interacts with the seller, while in the second, the mechanism can also interact with the buyer. In both cases, we derive optimal contracts specifying optimal deposits and verification policies. The gains from trade of the first contract are dominated by the second contract, on the whole domain of parameters. However, the first type of contract has the advantage of less communication and, therefore, more flexibility. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a key technology for the development of 5G networks, network slicing is developing rapidly. Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice. IEEE},

Then, next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party have emerged thanks to the appearance of smart contracts, which are computer protocols designed to facilitate, verify, and enforce automatically the negotiation and agreement among multiple untrustworthy parties. Despite the bright side of smart contracts, several concerns continue to undermine their adoption, such as security threats, vulnerabilities, and legal issues.

To do so, we present a taxonomy of existing blockchain-enabled smart contract solutions, categorize the included research papers, and discuss the existing smart contract-based studies. Based on the findings from the survey, we identify a set of challenges and open issues that need to be addressed in future studies.

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has recently inspired remarkable attention due to its unique features, such as privacy, accountability, immutability, and anonymity, to name of the few. In contrast, core functionalities of most Internet of Things (IoT) resources make them vulnerable to security threats. The IoT devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have limited capacity in terms of network, computing, and storage, which make them easier for vulnerable threats. Furthermore, a massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices, which is still an open challenge for the existing platforms to process, analyze, and unearth underlying patterns to provide convenience environment. Therefore, a new solution is required to ensure data accountability, improve data privacy and accessibility, and extract hidden patterns and useful knowledge to provide adequate services. In this paper, we present a secure fitness framework that is based on an IoT-enabled blockchain network integrated with machine learning approaches. The proposed framework consists of two modules: a blockchainbased IoT network to provide security and integrity to sensing data as well as an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine to discover hidden insights and useful knowledge from IoT and user device network data. The enhanced smart contract aims to support users with a practical application that provides real-time monitoring, control, easy access, and immutable logs of multiple devices that are deployed in several domains. The inference engine module aims to unearth underlying patterns and useful knowledge from IoT environment data, which helps in effective decision making to provide convenient services. For experimental analysis, we implement an intelligent fitness service that is based on an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine as a case study where several IoT fitness devices are used to securely acquire user personalized fitness data. Furthermore, a real-time inference engine investigates user personalized data to discover useful knowledge and hidden insights. Based on inference engine knowledge, a recommendation model is developed to recommend a daily and monthly diet, as well as a workout plan for better and improved body shape. The recommendation model aims to facilitate a trainer formulating effective future decisions of trainee’s health in terms of a diet and workout plan. Lastly, for performance analysis, we have used Hyperledger Caliper to access the system performance in terms of latency, throughput, resource utilization, and varying orderer and peers nodes. The analysis results imply that the design architecture is applicable for resource-constrained IoT blockchain platform and it is extensible for different IoT scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

Palinodia can be used to ensure the integrity of downloaded executable binaries by checking their hashes against the hashes stored in the blockchain. To make sure that not everyone can modify the data stored on the blockchain, an identity management system is required. This task is fulfilled by DecentID, which provides decentralized identities stored as smart contracts on the blockchain.

This paper intends to gather important information on the thoughts and outlooks of stakeholders on an achievement record system that uses blockchain and smart contract technology.

The first is to evaluate the suitability of the idea of building a trusted achievement record for learners in higher education, and to evaluate potential user knowledge of blockchain technology. This is to ensure that a designed system is usable. The second aim includes an interview conducted with a small group of participants to gather information about the challenges individuals have when creating, and reviewing CVs. Overall, 90% of participants agreed that there was a strong need for a trusted achievement record. In addition, 93.64% of respondents stated that they felt it was invaluable to have a system that is usable by all stakeholders. When tackling the second aim it was found that a primary challenge is lack of knowledge of blockchain and its complexity. From the employers' perspective, there is a lack of trust due to inaccuracies when students describe skills and qualifications in their resumes.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Recently, technology startups have leveraged the potential of blockchain-based technologies to govern institutions or interpersonal trust by enforcing signed treaties among different individuals in a decentralized environment. However, it is going to be hard enough convincing that the blockchain technology could completely replace the trust among trading partners in the sharing economy as sharing services always operate in a highly dynamic environment.With the rapid expanding of the rental market, the sharing economy faces more and more severe challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and concerns about abuses. This paper proposes an enhanced decentralized sharing economy service using the service level agreement (SLA), which documents the services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. The SLA specifications are defined as the smart contract, which facilitates multi-user collaboration and automates the process with no involvement of the third party. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed solution in the sharing economy, a notebook sharing case study is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric. The functionalities of the smart contract are tested using the Hyperledger Composer. Moreover, the efficiency of the designed approach is demonstrated through a series of experimental tests using different performance metrics. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts provide transparent automation in a broad range of services, including finance, the Internet of Things, and autonomous systems. However, the implementation of such services may easily involve security risks and functional errors, especially for complex services composed of different blockchains. To help developers focus on their business model instead of diving into the blockchain architecture heterogeneity, we propose a framework to enable analysis and comparison of composed services before deployment. This is achieved through the intensive use of model-based engineering allowing reasoning on the model before generating concrete deployment artifacts, especially for the safe orchestration of contract calling transactions. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Health Information Exchange (HIE) exhibits remarkable benefits for patient care such as improving healthcare quality and expediting coordinated care. The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology is seeking patient-centric HIE designs that shift data ownership from providers to patients. There are multiple barriers to patient-centric HIE in the current system, such as security and privacy concerns, data inconsistency, timely access to the right records across multiple healthcare facilities. After investigating the current workflow of HIE, this paper provides a feasible solution to these challenges by utilizing the unique features of blockchain, a distributed ledger technology which is considered 'unhackable'. Utilizing the smart contract feature, which is a programmable self-executing protocol running on a blockchain, we developed a blockchain model to protect data security and patients' privacy, ensure data provenance, and provide patients full control of their health records. By personalizing data segmentation and an 'allowed list' for clinicians to access their data, this design achieves patient-centric HIE. We conducted a large-scale simulation of this patient-centric HIE process and quantitatively evaluated the model's feasibility, stability, security, and robustness. © 2013 IEEE.},

Many applications focus on exploiting the Blockchain-native features (e.g. trust from consensus, and smart contracts) while paying less attention to the application-specific requirements. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study on the applications in the education and training sector, where Blockchain is leveraged to combat diploma fraud. We first present a general system structure for digitized diploma management systems and identify both functional and non-functional requirements. We then show that all existing Blockchain-based systems fall short in meeting these requirements. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a Blockchain-facilitated solution by leveraging some basic cryptographic primitives and data structures. Our analysis shows that the proposed solution respects all the identified requirements by design and can be further extended to enhance its security and privacy guarantees. Finally, we investigate the proposed solution's computational complexity and demonstrate its practicality.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fog computing systems are designed to provide localized computation, storage, and communication services in close proximity to the endpoint mobile and IoT devices. Fog service providers typically monetize their service usage via centralized payment mechanisms in unverifiable and non-transparent manner. Therefore, there exists a need for a trust-enabling payment mechanism whereby fog service providers should be incentivized or penalized based upon the continuous feedback from endpoint devices. We propose a decentralized reverse-bidding scheme developed using the key features of blockchain and smart contracts. We develop a solution that allows the users or devices to initiate the bidding process by making a request for services to be provided by nearby public fog nodes, and these fog nodes to make bid offers in return. The proposed scheme ensures that all fog nodes on the network can equally and fairly make offers to win the bid. The bidding process incorporates the automated payments at the end of the service. Our solution is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts. It also integrates a reputation system for fog nodes and imposes a penalty for misbehaving nodes. Our solution is fully decentralized and provides a high level of trust, transparency, and security. In the paper, we present the system architecture, implementation details, and show the correct functionality of the overall proposed solution. In addition, we provide performance, cost, and security analyses of the smart contract code to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness against major security concerns. The results show that the cost of running the smart contract remained less than three cents with the current Ethereum price (i.e., 183.22 USD/Eth). We have also made our smart contract code publicly available on Github.11https://github.com/MazenDB/ReverseAuction © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Degree attestation verification and traceability are complex one-to-one processes between the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and universities. The procedure shifted to the digitalized manner, but still, on a certain note, manual authentication is required. In the initial process, the university verified the degree and stamp seal first. Then, a physical channel of degree submission to the receiving ends is activated. After that, the degree is attested while properly examining and analyzing the tamper records related to degree credentials through e-communication with the university for verification and validation. This issue poses a serious challenge to educational information integrity and privacy. Potentially, blockchain technology could become a standardized platform to perform tasks including issuing, verifying, auditing, and tracing immutable records, which would enable the HEC, universities, and Federal Education Ministry (FEM) to quickly and easily get attested and investigate the forge proof versions of certificates. Besides, decentralized distributed data blocks in chronological order provide high security between distributed ledgers, consensus engine, digital signature, smart contracts, permissioned application, and private network node transactions that guarantee degree record validation and traceability. This paper presents an architecture (HEDU-Ledger) and detail design of blockchain-enabled hyperledger fabric applications implementation for degree attestation verification and traceable direct channel design between HEC and universities. The hyperledger fabric endorses attestation records first, and then validates (committer) the degree and maintains the secure chain of tracing between stakeholder peer nodes. Furthermore, this HEDU-Ledger architecture avoids language and administrative barriers. It also provides robustness in terms of security and privacy of records and maintains integrity with secure preservation as compared to that of the other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The complexity of today’s integrated circuit (IC) supply chain, organised in several tiers and including many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging to assess the history and integrity of procured ICs. This enables malicious practices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely dangerous, especially in supply chains of ICs for industrial control systems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can be put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by introducing Anti-BlUFf (Anti-counterfeiting Blockchain- and PUF-based infrastructure), an approach where ICs are uniquely identified and tracked along the chain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies; hence, it is decentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity of stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of ICs along the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary interested in tampering with ICs along the supply chain and then provide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed anti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking system against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show its technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit mitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our solution ad its integration with real IC supply chains. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers.

Apart from the tamper-proof exchange of transactions, distributed ledgers can provide a software environment for the trusted execution of smart contracts. In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied. Finally, we propose an architecture for the integration of the secure multi-contract platform into a 5G architecture. The integration proposal utilizes hybrid private-public blockchain networks for possible security, scalability, performance, and transaction cost optimization.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of Internet of things, all kinds of smart systems are quickly evolving to make our day-to-day life smoother and safer. Like many other sectors, transportation has entered a period of rapid change. Intelligent Traffic System is one of the fastest-growing fields within the smart systems, which is expected to increase road safety, mitigate traffic congestion, and enable fuel efficiency. The main functionalities of Intelligent Traffic System are as follows: (1) monitoring real-time traffic conditions in specific areas, (2) locating traffic emergencies (i.e. traffic accidents) in specific areas, and (3) dynamic monitoring and managing the continuous use in public transit services (i.e. change in car lanes) that may lead to changes in macro traffic conditions. This article will use the above-mentioned functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic System as underlying simulative scenarios, to design and to implement a smart transportation system based on Internet of things and blockchain—both share inherent distributed technology characteristics—combining both Internet of things sensor nodes and distributed ledger technology, to (1) record the changes in intelligent transportation systems and (2) set up a credit-token mechanism for paying the use and misuses in public transit services accordingly. The Intelligent Traffic System described in this article is intended to be used as experimental project only, given the terms and conditions as depicted in the simulated scenario. In real-life traffic scenarios, it may generate more complex system and data security issues, which will be elaborated and analyzed at the end of this article. Intelligent Traffic System is a comprehensive smart system; it can significantly change and reinvent the wheel for traffic conditions. Based on the system development as discussed in this article, there are still a lot of demands and challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Such topic scope will be explored in depth in our subsequent research. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Providing security and privacy to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks while achieving it with minimum performance requirements is an open research challenge. Blockchain technology, as a distributed and decentralized ledger, is a potential solution to tackle the limitations of the current peer-to-peer IoT networks. This paper presents the development of an integrated IoT system implementing the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to secure the edge computing devices by employing a local authentication process. In addition, the proposed model provides traceability for the data generated by the IoT devices. The presented solution also addresses the IoT systems’ scalability challenges, the processing power and storage issues of the IoT edge devices in the blockchain network. A set of built-in queries is leveraged by smart-contracts technology to define the rules and conditions. The paper validates the performance of the proposed model with practical implementation by measuring performance metrics such as transaction throughput and latency, resource consumption, and network use. The results show that the proposed platform with the HLF implementation is promising for the security of resource-constrained IoT devices and is scalable for deployment in various IoT scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Multiple-operators (multi-OPs) spectrum sharing mechanism can effectively improve the spectrum utilization in fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks. The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a permissioned blockchain trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless communication networks in this paper. The Multi-OPs Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart contract is designed on the constructed permissioned blockchain to implement the spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs. The MOSS smart contract is tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE) and the gas costs of MOSS smart contract is estimated. The performance analysis of the proposed permissioned blockchain trust framework demonstrates that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better than traditional spectrum allocation solutions. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the world to an apocalyptic standstill with huge economic burden and catastrophic healthcare consequences. COVID-19 pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs so far. It is now obvious that the world is in dire need for non-clinical, real-time, faster and cost-effective and secure smart solutions for monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients and hence mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, Machine learning approaches can be leveraged in all aspects that could impact the patients and the future care guidelines. However, ensuring the data privacy, security and the conformity to data protection regulations will become even more of a challenge. This leads to the requirement for secured and privacy-preserving machine learning mechanisms for COVID-19-based healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned IoMT data for a clinical decision support (CDS) system. The proposed system does not require any intervention or direct interactions between data owners. Both local training and building the global classification model run on verifiable and private smart contracts rather than relying on untrusted third parties. We find that the proposed system is more secure and efficient.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging immature technology that disrupt many well established industries nowadays, like finance, supply chain, transportation, energy, official registries (identity, vehicles,..). In this contribution we present a smart contracts library, named Crypto-Spatial, written for the Ethereum Blockchain and designed to serve as a framework for geospatially enabled decentralized applications (dApps) development. The main goal of this work is to investigate the suitability of Blockchain technology for the storage, retrieval and processing of vector geospatial data. The design and the proof-of-concept implementation presented are both based on the Open Geospatial Consortium standards: Simple Feature Access, Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) and Well Known Binary (WKB). Also, the FOAM protocol concept of Crypto-Spatial Coordinate (CSC) was used to uniquely identify spatial features on the Blockchain immutable ledger. The design of the Crypto-Spatial framework was implemented as a set of smart contracts using the Solidity object oriented programming language. The implemented library was assessed toward Etheruem's best practices design patterns and known security issues (common attacks). Also, a generic architecture for geospatially enabled decentralized applications, combining blockchain and IPFS technologies, was proposed. Finally, a proof-of-concept was developed using the proposed approach which main purpose is to port the UN/FAO-SOLA to Blockchain techspace allowing more transparency and simplifying access to users communities. The smart contracts of this prototype are live on the Rinkeby testnet and the frontend is hosted on Github pages.

	abstract = {Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {The IoT, or Internet of Things has been a major talking point amongst technology enthusiasts in recent years. The internet of thing (IoT) has been emerged and evolved rapidly, making the world's fabric around us smarter and more responsive. The smart home uses one such transformation of IoT, which seems to be the wave of the future. However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, data security, and privacy concerns about how our data is collected and shared with others, has also risen. To solve these challenges, an approach to data privacy and security in a smart home using blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. We propose authentication scheme that combines attribute-based access control with smart contracts and edge computing to create a secure framework for IoT devices in smart home systems. The edge server adds scalability to the system by offloading heavy processing activities and using a differential privacy method to aggregate data to the cloud securely and privately. We present several aspects of testing and implementing smart contracts, the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and system architecture and design. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system by fully examining its security and privacy goals in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Our framework achieves desired security and privacy goals and is resilient against modification, DoS attacks, data mining and linkage attacks. Finally, we undertake a performance evaluation to demonstrate the proposed scheme's feasibility and efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Applications of Blockchain (BC) technology and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasing exponentially. However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed.

	abstract = {Software development is a very broad activity that captures the entire life cycle of a software, which includes designing, programming, maintenance and so on. In this study, we focus on the maintenance-related concerns of the post-deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executed programs that run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they bring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software. According to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software maintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart contract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are the current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the answers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature review to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from 2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between academia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart contract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful responses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the first empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study can help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based projects, and we highlight some key future research directions to improve the Ethereum ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications bring evolved and intelligent services that can help improve users’ daily lives. These applications include home automation, health care, and smart agriculture. However, IoT development and adoption face various security and privacy challenges that need to be overcome. As a promising security paradigm, context-aware security enables one to enforce security and privacy mechanisms adaptively. Moreover, with the advancements in edge computing, context-aware security services can dynamically be placed close to a user’s location and enable the support of low latency communication and mobility. Therefore, the design of an adaptive and decentralized access control mechanism becomes a necessity. In this paper, we propose a decentralized context-aware authorization management as a service based on the blockchain. The proposed architecture extends the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework with blockchain technology and context-awareness capabilities. Instead of a classic Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth) access token, it uses a new contextual access token. The evaluation results show our proposition’s effectiveness and advantages in terms of usability, security, low latency, and energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

Security requirements in such scenario include integrity, confidentiality, traceability and notarization of exchanged data in the one hand plus access control, privacy and trust in the other one. In this context, we design a distributed resource management framework using the emerging smart contracts technology for Industry 4.0 applications and more specifically for smart factories environments. This last, named DRMF, utilizes three Ethereum smart contracts specifically a Governance Contract (GC), an Access Contract (AC) and a Lookup Contract (LC) that are respectively responsible for the registration of new joining entities as well as those requesting consensus partaking permissions, second the dynamic access authorization and third the mapping between the required services and contracts ensuring their management. Using the blockchain technology, this framework is expected to achieve distributed, flexible, verifiable and trustworthy access control in addition to a transparent, traceable and notarized resource usage and sharing. Results from a real implementation plus performance evaluation prove the proposed concept and demonstrate its feasibility. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the key benefits of blockchain technology is its ability to keep a permanent, unalterable record of transactions. In business environments, where companies interact with each other without a centralized authority to ensure trust between them, this has led to blockchain platforms and smart contracts being proposed as a means of implementing trustworthy collaborative processes. Software engineers must deal with them to ensure the quality of smart contracts in all phases of the smart contract lifecycle, from requirements specifications to design and deployment. This broad scope and criticality of smart contracts in business environments means that they have to be expressed in a language that is intuitive, easy-to-use, independent of the blockchain platform employed, and oriented towards software quality assurance. In this paper we present a key component: a first outline of a UML-based smart contract meta-model that would allow us to achieve these objectives. This meta-model will be enriched in future work to represent blockchain environments and automated testing. © 2021 River Publishers.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of a wide range of banking architectures, technologies, and applications made possible by the significant improvements in hardware, software, and networking technologies. Nowadays, innovative solutions are being developed by banks to leverage the benefits of blockchain, to improve their business agility and performance, and to make their business operations more efficient and secure. However, there are still cases where regular access to Internet is impossible or unreliable due to saturated networks or harsh environments, hence limiting the deployment of typical blockchain based solutions. In this context, an approach using a new connectivity technology is needed in order to increase mobile Internet services for any device to reach nearly 95% of the world population, instantly, simply by drawing on existing mobile phone networks, with no additional infrastructure development. We aim to give the user full bank access from their device, even if the device is not a smart one, using ordinary mobile phone networks. However, providing efficient and secure communications over lossy and low bandwidth networks remains a challenge. The main objective of this paper will be to design an end-to-end and low overhead secure solution for the communications between mobile devices and their corresponding remote application servers that using blockchain via ordinary mobile networks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Digitally signed documents facilitate a cost-effective verification process. However, vulnerability to fraud remains due to reliance on centralized authorities that lack full transparency. In this paper, we present the mechanisms we designed to create secure and machine-verifiable academic credentials. Our protocol models a diploma as an evolving set of immutable credentials. The credentials are built as a tree-based data structure with linked time-stamping, where portions of credentials are distributed over a set of smart contracts. Our design prevents fraud of diplomas and eases the detection of degree mills, while increasing the transparency and trust in the issuer’s procedures. Our evaluation shows that our solution offers a certification system with strong cryptographic security and imposes a high level of transparency of the certification process. We achieve these benefits with acceptable costs compared to existing solutions that lack such transparency. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the continuous enrichment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the demand for value exchange and collaborative control between heterogeneous IoT applications is increasing. However, the user management space varies depending on the IoT application, where the security domain stands as an example. It is one of the key technologies of data sharing between heterogeneous IoT organizations to cross the boundary of the security domain and verify the identity and authority of users in other security domains. Aiming at the slow speed of authentication protocol authority authentication during cross-domain access and without considering the actual cross-domain situation, the same cryptographic system parameters are used for all communication nodes in a cross-domain environment. This article proposes a heterogeneous Internet of Things data access authority authentication scheme between applications. Based on certificate-less public key cryptography and smart contract technology, a certificate-less cross-domain authentication scheme that supports parameter differentiation is designed and implemented. The theoretical and empirical analyses, comparing the communication volume, identity signature, and verification calculation cost, validated that the method proposed improves the cross-domain identity authorization authentication ability and supports the use of differentiated cryptographic system parameters among different IoT applications.  © 2021 Shichang Xuan et al.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology allows virtual disintermediation and automatization of property transactions, which might help to design future platforms, intended to facilitate cross-border transactions within the EU and worldwide. To this end, users of these blockchain-based platforms may create the so-called “digital tokens” or “colored coins” that aim to represent rights over different types of “real world” assets. By transferring a digital token, the parties aim to transfer the ownership or other property rights over the asset represented by the token without the intervention of traditional intermediaries, such as real estate conveyancers, land registrars or notaries specializing in real estate. However, this new technological tool raises several questions in the field of private law, such as the legal nature of the token, how the effective transfer of the property rights operates or how ownership rules may be applied in this decentralized environment (e.g. rights and duties of the token holder). Some of the issues at stake have only been tentatively addressed by both lawmakers and academia. In light of this research gap, this paper addresses these controversial issues from both a private law and a comparative perspective, and proposes a model to tokenize the right of usufruct over chattels and real estate, analyzing its legal viability and limitations across six jurisdictions. The paper concludes that private law rules may be adapted to the tokenization of property rights, which may contribute to the establishment of a digital market for the trading of asset-backed tokens worldwide. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of big data is pushing forward the paradigm of cloud-based data store today. Among other, distributed storage systems are widely adopted due to their superior performance and continuous availability. However, due to the potentially wide attacking surfaces of the public cloud, outsourcing data store inevitably raises new concerns on user privacy exposure and unauthorized data access. Besides, directly introducing a centralized third-party authority for query authorization management does not work because it still can be compromised. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted framework that can support trustworthy data sharing services. In particular, data owners allow to outsource their sensitive data to distributed systems in encrypted form. By leveraging smart contracts of blockchain, a data owner can distribute secret keys for authorized users without extra round interaction to generate the permitted search tokens. Meanwhile, such blockchain-assisted framework naturally solves the trust issues of query authorization. Besides, we devise a secure local index framework to support encrypted keyword search with forward privacy and mitigate blockchain overhead. To validate our design, we implement the prototype and deploy it at Amazon Cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the blockchain-assisted design. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The increased use of renewable energy in the power grid environment creates serious issues, for example, connectivity, transmission, distribution, con-trol, balancing, and monitoring volatility on both sides. This poses extreme challenges to tackle the entire bidirectional power flow throughout the system. To build distributed monitoring and a secure control operation of node transactions in the real-time system that can manage and execute power exchanging and utilizing, balancing, and maintaining energy power failure. This paper proposed a blockchain Hyperledger Sawtooth enabling a novel and secure distributed energy transmission node in the EPS-ledger network architecture with a robust renewable power infiltration. The paper focuses on a cyber–physical power grid control and monitoring system of renewable energy and protects this distributed network transaction on the blockchain and stores a transparent digital ledger of power. The Hyperledger Sawtooth-enabled architecture allows stakeholders to exchange information related to power operations and control monitoring in a private ledger network architecture and investigate the different activities, preserved in the interplanetary file systems. Fur-thermore, we design, create, and deploy digital contracts of the cyber–physical energy monitoring system, which allows interaction between participating stakeholders and registration and presents the overall working operations of the proposed architecture through a sequence diagram. The proposed solution delivers integrity, confidentiality, transparency, availability, and control access of the distribution of the power system and maintains an immutable operations and control monitoring ledger by secure blockchain technology. © 2021 by the authors.

As such, innovative technology such as blockchain has emerged as a potential approach for addressing coronavirus patient tracking. Blockchain technology can tackle pandemics by allowing early detection of outbreaks, protecting individual privacy while maintaining data security by using smart contracts. Motivated by these facts, we propose a novel blockchain-based framework that integrates intercountry for COVID-19 to track infected or tested patients globally using the methodology of design science research.

	abstract = {Blockchain and other forms of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provide an opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Such contracts may facilitate the creation of distributed systems and services for transport and logistics that are locally constructed and adaptable, thus supporting specific community needs and sustainable objectives. However the technological infrastructures that underpin these systems are complex, making it difficult to engage publics in design processes. GeoPact grounds infrastructure in relatable physical activities, that are linked with holistic views of the system, and creates new experiences for public engagement. In these activities participants were invited to roleplay as couriers, and to progress through delivery scenarios which were governed by smart contracts. Participants and spectators were then encouraged to discuss their reactions, concerns and ideas. This paper illustrates the GeoPact assembly and reflects on our engagement activities. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain system for telemedicine data storage. Telemedicine is one of the currently developing digital technologies in the health and medical sectors. Telemedicine can be more efficient when seeking treatment because patients do not need to see a doctor face to face. When using blockchain technology, the stored data becomes more transparent for each node in the blockchain network but has verification on every transaction which takes time and gas costs. However, telemedicine has several risks and problems, one of which is long data storage process time because there must be a verification process first to ensure data security. Another problem faced is the issue of the gas fee of the blockchain telemedicine system which is billed in every data storage transaction. In this study, a blockchain system was introduced for managing and securing databases on telemedicine. The implementation of this blockchain system was carried out on a website page that can add data to and retrieve data from the blockchain system. The results of this study showed that blockchain was successfully implemented to store telemedicine data with Ethereum. The analysis in this paper refers to the set and gets functions. The set function is used to send data to the blockchain, and the get function is used to retrieve data from the blockchain. From testing, the Get function has a much faster execution time than the Set function because the Get function does not require verification to retrieve its data. In the iterations carried out—namely 1, 10, and 100—the longest time on average was at 100 iterations when compared to the other iterations. In the tests carried out, the more characters that were stored, the more gas costs must be paid. In the tests, the percentage increase in costs was 0.34% per character. © 2021},

	abstract = {Blockchain provides an immutable distributed ledger for storing transactions. One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Currently, data auditing is an important means to check the integrity of the data stored on the cloud. Existing data auditing schemes have done a lot of work in terms of functionality, implementation, and security. As we can see, all of these schemes are based on the auditing framework proposed by Ateniese et al., which uses random sampling to probabilistically check whether the data is integrity or not. But multiple repeated sampling may lead to an intersection between the challenge sets selected each time, reducing the probability of detection, and the time for detecting corrupted blocks will be indefinite. If the corrupted data is not found for a long time, the data remedial measures will become invalid, resulting in permanent data loss. To address the above problem, we designed an efficient sampling verification algorithm. Based on this algorithm, the auditing scheme is further optimized, and a dynamic auditing function has been developed for the scheme to facilitate data owners to update data. Through the security analysis, our scheme is soundness. The experiment shows that our sampling verification can detect corrupted blocks faster than other auditing schemes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For any distributed system, and especially for the Internet of Things, recording interactions between devices is essential. At first glance, blockchains seem to be suitable for storing these interactions, as they allow multiple parties to share a distributed ledger. However, at a closer look, blockchains require heavy computations, large memory capacity, and always-on communication to the cloud; these are three properties that are challenging for IoT devices with limited resources.In this paper, we present IoTLogBlock to address these challenges. IoTLogBlock connects resource-constrained IoT devices to the blockchain, and it consists of three building blocks jointly enabling recording transactions: a lightweight contract signing protocol, a blockchain network, and a smart contract. The contract signing protocol allows devices to interact locally to perform transactions, even if no communication to the cloud and the blockchain exists at that moment. At a later time, devices forward the stored transactions to the blockchain, where a smart contract ultimately verifies the transactions.We evaluate our design on low-power devices and quantify the performance in terms of memory, computation, and energy consumption. Our results show that a constrained device can create and sign a transaction within 3 s on average. Finally, we expose the devices to network scenarios with edge connections ranging from 10 s to over 2 h. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology that brings transparency in a scalable way for multiple organizations and this is thanks to its several features. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them, decentralization is undoubtedly the most interesting one. Organizations can share data within a distributed ledger. As a consequence, each one can access synchronized data stored in its local Blockchain node. This functionality improves transaction tracking and facilitates access to data within a private group of organizations. However, in some cases, even if organizations accept to share data, they require to hide some private information related to their users or their business model. To tackle privacy and trust issues between organizations, this paper presents a blockchain architecture based on the proxy re-encryption scheme. This scheme is integrated within smart contracts to provide a very efficient, fast, and secure platform. The proposed architecture is implemented in an Hyperledger Blockchain and tested in a real transport and mobility use case.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The existing smart contract are expensive, single application scenario and inefficient. This paper aims to propose a new smart contract model to solve these problems. Design/methodology/approach: By investigating the research history, models and platforms, this paper summarizes the shortcomings of existing smart contracts. Based on the content and architecture of traditional contract, a smart contract model with wider application scope is designed. Findings: In this paper, several models are used to describe the operation mechanism of smart contracts. To facilitate computer execution, a decomposition method is proposed, which divides smart contracts into several sub-contracts. Then, the advantages and deployment methods of smart contract are discussed. On this basis, a specific example is given to illustrate how the application of smart contract will change our life. Originality/value: Smart contract is gradually applied to more fields. In this paper, the structure and operation mechanism of smart contract system in reality are given, which will be beneficial to the application of smart contract to more complex systems. © 2019, Tianyu Feng, Xiao Yu, Yueting Chai and Yi Liu.},

Various systems that adopts the blockchain in managing medical records have been proposed. However, there is a need for more work to better characterize, understand and evaluate the employment of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. In this paper, a design of blockchain based system, namely MedChain, for managing medical records is proposed. MedChain is designed to improve the current systems as it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access for medical records by patients, health care providers, and other third parties, while keeping the patients' privacy. MedChain employs timed-based smart contracts for governing transactions and controlling accesses to electronic medical records. It adopts advanced encryption techniques for providing further security. This work proposes a new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of health providers regarding their efforts on maintaining medical records and creating new blocks. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the MedChain performance, and results indicate the efficiency of our proposal in handling a large dataset at low latency. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are applications that execute on blockchains. Today they manage billions of dollars in value and motivate visionary plans for pervasive blockchain deployment. While smart contracts inherit the availability and other security assurances of blockchains, however, they are impeded by blockchains' lack of confidentiality and poor performance. We present Ekiden, a system that addresses these critical gaps by combining blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Ekiden leverages a novel architecture that separates consensus from execution, enabling efficient TEE-backed confidentiality-preserving smart-contracts and high scalability. Our prototype (with Tendermint as the consensus layer) achieves example performance of 600x more throughput and 400x less latency at 1000x less cost than the Ethereum mainnet. Another contribution of this paper is that we systematically identify and treat the pitfalls arising from harmonizing TEEs and blockchains. Treated separately, both TEEs and blockchains provide powerful guarantees, but hybridized, though, they engender new attacks. For example, in naïve designs, privacy in TEE-backed contracts can be jeopardized by forgery of blocks, a seemingly unrelated attack vector. We believe the insights learned from Ekiden will prove to be of broad importance in hybridized TEE-blockchain systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

These case studies also highlight a number of challenges and opportunities, and demonstrate how a flexible research approach can increase efficiency and generate findings that are likely to influence blockchain standardisation at a global level. Case Study 1 describes our research into the legal status of smart contracts and the challenge of delivering clear findings about unclear subject matter. Case Study 2, which involved examining the sufficiency of existing regulatory frameworks in the supply chain and trade facilitation context, illustrates how rigid formatting specifications can impact the content of findings.

	abstract = {The European research project GHOST challenges the traditional cyber security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by exploiting novel technologies, such as blockchain, to provide resilience and integrity of decision making on the communication exchange in a smart home context. When it comes to novel cyber security solutions for extremely heterogeneous environments like IoT and smart homes, the key focus is typically given to the understanding of network activities and elimination of suspicious traffic. The GHOST project adds an extra dimension to this approach by integrating blockchain technology at its core decision mechanism. On a daily basis, each GHOST installation is encountering malicious behaviour and suspicious IoT communications, where easy information sharing with other installations, as well as decentralised decision making, are mandatory features for the efficient protection of the end-user. GHOST's Smart Contracts (SC) are designed to tackle in an easy, yet productive way, the reporting on suspicious IP addresses which the IoT devices in a smart home are trying to communicate with. Two variations of blacklisting smart contracts are presented in this paper, covering a diverse spectrum of possible attack vectors while closely following the Privacy by Design (PbD) principles. A reputation scoring scheme for malicious IPs reporting is integrated in the SC, uncovering the implementation details on the penalisation of existing entries in case of malicious behaviour of reporting devices. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are one of the main building blocks for securing communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the control of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by numerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault tolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart contract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of PKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity systems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even constant) sized amount of data for verifying identity records stored off chain. However, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little information regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs. In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart contract based PKI of Patsonakis et al. on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs constant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore this tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates the need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of Patsonakis et al. and, as illustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized state that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we compare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g., the Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart contract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost model. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would be useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so that it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is an innovative way to fund projects based on blockchain. The funding is based on the selling of tokens by means of decentralized applications called smart contracts written in Solidity, a programming language specific for Ethereum blockchain. The ICOs work in a volatile context and it is crucial that the team is capable of handling constant changes. The Agile methods, proven practices enabling to develop software in presence of changing requirements, could be a means for managing uncertainty. The main goals of this work are to understand software engineering activities related to ICOs, recognize the ICOs developed using Agile methods, and make a comparison between ICOs and Agile ICOs. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis of Agile ICOs concerning project planning, software development, and code features. Our work shows that the roles of the people involved in an ICO can be compared to the typical roles of the SCRUM methodology. The majority of Agile ICOs use tool of testing before storing smart contract on blockchain. Finally, the application of volumetric and complexity software metrics shows that the files of Agile ICOs is on average shorter and less complex than in other smart contracts. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is growing fast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and the Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing contracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2018.},

In order to facilitate these services, it is essential to incentivise the device owners to become service providers. However, previous research failed to deliver any practical payment systems for opportunistic data services. Inspired by smart contracts functionalities of bitcoin, this paper proposes a payment system named OPPay for opportunistic data services, which implements a micropayment communication protocol for mobile devices to perform data transactions and make payments using bitcoin. The system is designed to make incremental payments and thus resilient to interrupted communications caused by human mobility in the mobile etwork. By implementing and evaluating the system for three different applications, we show that the system is able to work in heterogeneous hardware and software environments and can achieve fast transactions confirmation with small fee overhead and low faulty payment value. © 2017 IEEE.},

Through introducing the witness role and using the blockchain based smart contract, we solve the trust issues about who can detect the service violation, how the violation is confirmed and the compensation is guaranteed. In this model, a verifiable consensus sortition algorithm proposed by us is firstly leveraged to select independent witnesses to form a witness committee. They are responsible for a specific service level agreement and get paid by monitoring and detecting service violation. Through carefully designing the witness' payoff function in the agreement, we further leverage game theory to analyze and prove that it is not the witness itself is trustworthy. Instead, the witness has to tell the truth because of its greedy nature, which is the desire to maximize its own revenue. As long as the service violation is confirmed by the witness committee, the compensation is automatically transferred to the customer by the smart contract. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype with the smart contract of Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the feasibility of our model. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On one hand, IoT devices are 'weak' and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively 'vulnerable' facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named 'EdgeChain' based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or 'coin' system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There are two traditional data trading modes, the hosting mode, and the aggregation mode, which depend on the trusted third parties to a large extent. The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized. This paper presents the whole process of smart contract from the design and implementation to the test completion and provides the security analysis and performance evaluation. The full code of smart contract and the ABI interface have been uploaded to the GitHub for the public release. © 2013 IEEE.},

It serves a purpose to be a Proof of Work (PoW) of a blockchain system. This model contains application layer and blockchain layer with smart contract inside. The smart contracts act as a conditional filter which follows the regulation rules. It contains three contracts starting from the declaration of each offence's demerit points and fines until the penalties when a certain amount of demerit points is collected, including revocation of driver license. The contracts will be automatically executed when such conditions are fulfilled. A transaction schema is also designed to match the schema of a traffic offence system. This model is deployed in online environment with two servers synced to each other to prove the decentralized characteristic of blockchain. It is developed using NodeJS while preserving JSON format for transaction between server and client. A user interface is also provided as a simulation media where a traffic officer can input offences and send it to blockchain server while public users or the driver itself can check the status of the driver license recorded on the blockchain. Government officer can monitor the records through a dashboard analytics provided which contains graphs and charts based on the records. This interface is used as media to do evaluation which produces satisfying results. The evaluation shows that the smart contracts are executed properly as compared to real regulations. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.},

In order to efficiently detect and prevent food safety problems and trace the accountability, building a reliable traceability system is indispensable. It is especially essential to accurately record, share, and trace the specific data within the whole food supply chain, including the process of production, processing, warehousing, transportation, and retail. The traditional traceability systems have issues, such as data invisibility, tampering, and sensitive information disclosure. The blockchain is a promising technology for the food safety traceability system because of the characteristics, such as the irreversible time vector, smart contract, and consensus algorithm. This paper proposes a food safety traceability system based on the blockchain and the EPC Information Services and develops a prototype system. The management architecture of on-chain off-chain data is proposed as well, through which the traceability system can alleviate the data explosion issue of the blockchain for the Internet of Things. Furthermore, the enterprise-level smart contract is designed to prevent data tampering and sensitive information disclosure during information interaction among participants. The prototype system was implemented based on the Ethereum. According to the test results, the average time of information query response is around 2 ms, while the amount of on-chain data and query counts are 1 GB and 1000 times/s, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.},

We elegantly refine the proposed mobile payment scheme to make it suitable for computation-constrained mobile devices. The practicability of the proposed mobile payment scheme is then certified via a rigorous security analysis and thorough performance evaluation using the Raspberry PI as the implementation platform for our proposed scheme. Furthermore, we implement a transaction repository with the aid of smart contract technology. The simulation results, based on Ethereum, demonstrate the feasibility of employing the smart contract technology to secure mobile payments. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it’s hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue for the role of the blockchain, i.e., distributed ledger technology, in building innovative business models, including machine money, autonomous economic agents and decentralised organisations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things. Findings: The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology’s adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies. Originality/value: The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In light of these requirements, we propose in this paper the use of a blockchain-based approach to support data accountability and provenance tracking. Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three models for our approach with di.erent granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions. Our implementations show in practice the feasibility and limitations of contracts for the purposes identified in this paper. © 2017 ACM.},

Firstly, based on the blockchain and smart contract technology, a decentralized power trading model is proposed to realize the information equivalence and transparent openness of power trading. Then, considering the randomness and uncertainty of EV charging and discharging, the EV trading parties use the reverse auction mechanism based on dynamic pricing strategy to complete the transaction matching, which can not only improve the profit of the less competitive power seller, but also it can reduce the cost of the electricity purchaser. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of our proposed scheme, V2G's EV power trading smart contract was designed, and the smart contract was released to Ethereum and simulated experiments were carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with traditional power trading schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the past fewyears, researchers and practitioners have highlighted the potential of Blockchain (BC) and distributed ledger technology to revolutionize government processes. Blockchain technology enables distributed power and embedded security. As such, Blockchain is regarded as an innovative, general purpose technology, offering new ways of organization in many domains, including e-government for transactions and information exchange. However, due to its very characteristics of peer to peer information exchange, its distributed nature, the still developing technology, the involvement of new actors, roles, etc., the implementation of blockchain applications raise issues that need governance attention. BC initiatives have implications for citizen trust, privacy, inclusion and participation. Governmental organizations need a thorough understanding of the BC design principles, the possible applications in the domain of e-government and the exploration of governance mechanisms to deal with the limitations and challenges of the BC technology when used in a myriad of sectors, ranging from the financial and business sector to the social domains of healthcare and education. In this panel we explore the impact of block chain technology on all levels of government and create an awareness of effects or applications in society that raise governance issues. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, has been designed to use these programs offering secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine performs smart contracts runs, where the execution of each contract is limited to the amount of gas required to execute the operations described in the code. Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non-negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts. In order to show the generality of our method on other use cases, we also report its performance on video on demand recommendation. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rise of smart contract systems such as Ethereum has resulted in a proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications including applications that store and manage a wide range of data. Current smart contracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed entirely on-chain, resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper, we discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by splitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract. Specifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or sensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that is signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed approach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when all of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and content of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a dispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain contract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make miners enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the ability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which incentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract. We discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain contracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling dishonest participants in the system. Our implementation and evaluation of the proposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in Ethereum. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The evolution of Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) boosts the amount of IIoT data. Machine learning promotes the progress of data analytics services. In order to facilitate the flow and explore the economic value of IIoT data, it is crucial to consider data packet transactions (DPTs) and data analytics service transactions (DASTs) simultaneously. Centralized data trading platforms emerge to realize transactions of data commodities. However, centralized platforms lack trust and robustness. How to realize DPTs and DASTs in a decentralized way is a challenging issue. In this paper, a new transaction solution based on the smart contract-enabled blockchain technology is proposed, which consists of the DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract. The DPT smart contract is implemented to trade data packets. The DAST smart contract provides a competitive way to trade data analytics services. Both smart contracts are designed to enable entities in IIoT to execute DPTs and DASTs automatically and honestly. Moreover, the transaction disputes between different IIoT entities are solved by the big data center off-chain, and the treatment results will be recorded on the blockchain by the big data center. The DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract are implemented and tested on Remix integrated development environment to achieve DPTs and DASTs. The gas costs of smart contracts are estimated and the security of the proposed solution is analyzed. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed solution is secure and feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

Therefore, this study combines IoT with blockchain-based smart contracts for SHM of underground structures to define a novel, efficient, scalable, and secure distributed network for enhancing operational safety. In this blockchain-IoT network, the characteristics of locally centralized and globally decentralized distribution have been activated by dividing them into core and edge networks. This division enhances the efficiency and scalability of the system. The proposed system was effective in simulation for autonomous monitoring and control of structures. After proper design, the decentralized blockchain networks may effectively be deployed for transparent and efficient information sharing, smart contracts-based autonomous decision making, and data security in SHM. © 2018 by the authors.

Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Businesses need trust to confidently perform trade among each other. Centralized business models are the only mature solutions available to perform trades over the Internet. However, they have many problems which includes but are not limited to the fact that these create bottleneck on the server as well as requires trusted third parties. Recently, decentralized solutions have gained significant popularity and acceptance for future businesses. The wide acceptance of such systems is indeed due to the trust management among various untrusted business stakeholders. Many solutions have been proposed in this regard to provide de-centralized infrastructure for various business models. A standard solution that is acceptable to the industry is still in demand. Hyperledger umbrella Blockchain projects, that are supported by IBM and many other industry big players are gaining popularity due to its efficient and pluggable design. In this study, the author present the idea of utilizing Blockchain to design a Value-Added Tax (VAT) system for Saudi Arabia's newly introduced tax system. The reason to select this business model for VAT is twofold. First, it provides an untampered distributed ledger, which cannot be deceived by any party. Each transaction in the system cannot go unnoticed by the smart contract. Secondly, it provides a transparent record, and updates all involved parties regarding each activity performed by stakeholders. The newly proposed system will provide a transparent database of VAT transactions according to our smart contract design and at each stage of supply chain, tax will be deducted and stored on peer-to-peer network via consensus process. The author believes that the proposed solution will have significant impact on VAT collection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net.

Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-to-face communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans-organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as 'autonomous agents' running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis. A prototype of the smart contract is created and deployed on Ethereum's Testnet blockchain, and the source code is publicly available. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To improve the security performance of blockchain smart contracts against quantum attacks, a smart contract based on light-weighted quantum blind signature is proposed here. Firstly, a smart contract architecture is built after the discussion of related researches, and information processing and information transmitting for quantum blind signature are analyzed. Secondly, the life cycle and signature rules of quantum blind signature for smart contracts are presented. Thirdly, a quantum blind signature protocol for single signer in light-weighted smart contract is put forward, where its algorithm design and business flow are introduced in detail before the security performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Fourthly, based on the former single-person signature algorithm, a more complex multi-person quantum blind signature algorithm is proposed, and its security is also analyzed. Fifthly, related references are compared to verify the proposed method. The proposed quantum signature schemes based on quantum entanglement features can be used in single signer case or more, and will improve the security of blockchain smart contracts against quantum attacks, but with light-weighted structure and no need of any trusted third party or arbitrary institute. Finally, some suggestions for engineering applications and the research results are summarized and the future research is prospected. © 2013 IEEE.},

Therefore, we aim at improving the data ownership, transparency, and auditability for users. To this end, we propose an end-to-end privacy-preserving framework for the IoT data using blockchain technology. The smart contract use in our framework will hence enforce the privacy requirement compliance according to the user’s (i.e., data owner) privacy preferences and end-user’s (i.e., data consumer) requests.

Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design non-fixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {In cloud system, user identity authentication is a key problem. If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, an individual under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto devised a revolutionary technology called blockchain as the engine behind the first decentralized virtual currency called Bitcoin. A radical concept departing from government-centric controlled currencies, Bitcoin has emerged as a disruptive technology with the power to revolutionize business and its processes. Advantages of the blockchain include decentralized control, immutability, elimination of central authority and solution of concurrency problems in traditional databases. Leveraging on the advantages of blockchain technology defined above, this paper discusses the potential application of blockchain technology for storage of Islamic marriage certificates. Marriage certificates are documents issued to couples to legally recognize their marriage. Due to its paper-based nature, there is significant risk for them to be forged or frauded. These issues can be addressed effective using blockchain. The proposed application was implemented using smart contracts on a simulated Ethereum platform. A smart contract is designed to execute automatically under certain predefined conditions. The use of smart contracts eliminate manipulation by a single party. In addition, the immutable concept of blockchain ensures that data integrity is always preserved, greatly reducing the risk of fraud. © 2018 Authors.},

Although there are platforms available to store educational activity traces outside of a central repository, no solution currently guarantees that these traces are authentic when they are retrieved for review. This paper presents a blueprint for an architecture that employs blockchain technology to sign and validate learning traces, allowing them to be stored in a distributed network of repositories without diminishing their authenticity. Our proposal puts participants in online learning activities at the center of the design process, granting them the option to store learning traces in a location of their choice. Using smart contracts, stakeholders can retrieve the data, securely share it with third parties and ensure it has not been tampered with, providing a more transparent and reliable source for learning analytics. Nonetheless, a preliminary evaluation found that only 56% of teachers surveyed considered tamper-evident storage a useful feature of a learning trace repository. These results motivate further examination with other end users, such as learning analytics researchers, who may have stricter expectations of authenticity for data used in their practice. © 2018 IEEE.},

Securify’s analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract’s dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, it has analyzed > 18K contracts submitted by its users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits by experts. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Blockchain is highly secure in design and can hand huge data efficiently. A smart contract, based on a blockchain, can automate the entire process and make the contract self-executing in nature. Since the first introduction of these technologies in the 1990s, they have been at the center interest for academia and industry. Numerous researchers and practitioners have investigated the principles and usage of blockchain and smart contracts. However, little is coincidental regarding estimating the consumer's additional willingness to pay (WTP) and analyzing the relationship with socio-economic characteristics of the consumer for blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector. This study conducted the survey on 1000 heads of the household or homemakers who represent population well in South Korea and estimated additional WTP using one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation (OOHB DC CV) method. About 65% of sample respondents answered they are willing to pay some additional premium for blockchain and smart contracts. The mean WTP has the value of KRW 28,425.43 (USD 25.38) and the median WTP is KRW 16,111.71 (USD 14.39). Those with high incomes, high education and more insurance contracts are more likely to pay extra for insurance policies using blockchain and smart contracts. Considering the total number of households in South Korea, the aggregated additional WTP is about 8 percent of the net income of the insurance industry in fiscal year of 2017. Consequently, strategic development of insurance products using block chains and smart contracts targeting educated consumers with high-income will increase the number of policyholders, which can in turn increase premium revenues. © 2018 by the author.},

	abstract = {Scaling the transaction throughput of decentralized blockchain ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has been an ongoing challenge. Two-party duplex payment channels have been designed and used as building blocks to construct linked payment networks, which allow atomic and trust-free payments between parties without exhausting the resources of the blockchain. Once a payment channel, however, is depleted (e.g., because transactions were mostly unidirectional) the channel would need to be closed and re-funded to allow for new transactions. Users are envisioned to entertain multiple payment channels with different entities, and as such, instead of refunding a channel (which incurs costly on-chain transactions), a user should be able to leverage his existing channels to rebalance a poorly funded channel. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first solution that allows an arbitrary set of users in a payment channel network to securely rebalance their channels, according to the preferences of the channel owners. Except in the case of disputes (similar to conventional payment channels), our solution does not require onchain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing blockchains. In our security analysis, we show that an honest participant cannot lose any of its funds while rebalancing. We finally provide a proof of concept implementation and evaluation for the Ethereum network. © 2017 author(s).},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is getting out of its infancy, into full maturity, and tends to be developed in an explosively rapid way, with more and more data transmitted and processed. As a result, the ability to manage devices deployed worldwide has been given more and advanced requirements in practical application performances. Most existing IoT platforms are highly centralized architectures, which suffer from various technical limitations, such as a cyber-attack and single point of failure. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data accessing, while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated IoT platform using blockchain technology to guarantee sensing data integrity. The aim of this platform is to afford the device owner a practical application that provides a comprehensive, immutable log and allows easy access to their devices deployed in different domains. It also provides characteristics of general IoT systems, allows for real-time monitoring, and control between the end user and device. The business logic of the application is defined by the smart contract, which contains rules and conditions. The proposed approach is backed by a proof of concept implementation in realistic IoT scenarios, utilizing Raspberry Pi devices and a permissioned network called Hyperledger Fabric. Lastly, a benchmark study using various performance metrics is made to highlight the significance of the proposed work. The analysis results indicate that the designed platform is suitable for the resource-constrained IoT architecture and is scalable to be extended in various IoT scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.

Simplicity comes with formal denotational semantics defined in Coq, a popular, general purpose software proof assistant. Simplicity also includes operational semantics that are defined with an abstract machine that we call the Bit Machine. The Bit Machine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution. While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary function, which we believe is enough to build useful "smart contracts" for blockchain applications. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard’s (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard’s applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results.

Gas, paid in Ethers (i.e., the cryptocurrency in Ethereum), is required for the costs to upload and run smart contracts on Ethereum. As cost-inefficiently designed smart contracts result in unnecessary costs, it is vital to eliminate any gas-wasteful code fragments to optimize the deployment costs. In this study, we define five gas-wasteful patterns: ‘Over-public variables’, ‘Redundant initial values’, ‘Loose packing’, ‘Non-base unit types’, and ‘Non-constant variables’, based on the state variables in Solidity, the most commonly used implementation language for smart contracts in Ethereum. We also propose improvement methods related to these patterns and a solution to identify and eliminate the patterns. Furthermore, we analyze 143 real-world contracts deployed on Ethereum and find that 56% of them include the above-mentioned patterns. We also upgrade 43 of the pattern-matched contracts and demonstrate that their deployment costs are decreased on an average by 13.47%, and the most-reduced rate is 64%. © 2017 SERSC Australia.},

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based task matching scheme for crowdsourcing with a secure and reliable matching. Instead of utilizing a centralized cloud server, we employ smart contracts, an emerging blockchain technology, to provide reliable and transparent matching. In this way, data confidentiality and identity anonymity are achieved effectively and efficiently.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT)-based E-commerce is a new business model that relies on autonomous transaction management on IoT-devices. The management system toward IoT-based E-commerce demands autonomy, lightweight, and legitimacy. As blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, we adopt it to design the autonomous transaction management system on IoT E-commerce. However, current blockchain solutions, most namely cryptocurrencies, have fatal drawbacks of nonsupervisability and huge computational overhead, and hence cannot be directly applied on IoT-based E-commerce. In this paper, we propose NormaChain, a blockchain-based normalized autonomous transaction settlement system for IoT-based E-commerce. By designing a special three-layer sharding blockchain network, we can significantly increase transaction efficiency and system scalability. Additionally, by designing an innovative decentralized public key searchable encryption scheme (decentralized public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme), we can uncover illegal and criminal transactions and achieve crime traceability. Our new decentralized PEKS scheme cryptographically eliminates the dependence of a trusted central authority in the original PEKS scheme and instead expands it to a fully decentralized governance, which distributes the supervision power equally among all parties. More importantly, by proving NormaChain is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks and against the stealing of the secret key, we show that NormaChain prevents a legitimate user's privacy from being violated by banks, supervisors or malicious adversaries. Finally, we deliver the NormaChain system with design details and full implementations. Experiments show that the average transaction-per-second on IoT devices is around 113, and the supervision accuracy is 100% when proper target illegal keywords are provided. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the storage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on mobile cloud environments, where mobile devices are integrated with cloud computing to facilitate medical data exchanges among patients and healthcare providers. This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in lightweight access control design, minimum network latency with high security and data privacy levels, compared to the existing data sharing models. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed data storage has received more attention due to its advantages in reliability, availability and scalability, and it brings both opportunities and challenges for distributed data storage transaction. The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in and single point failure risk. To overcome the above shortcomings, considering the storage policy with erasure coding, in this paper we propose a decentralized transaction method for cloud storage based on a smart contract, which takes into account the resource cost for distributed data storage. First, to guarantee the availability and decrease the storing cost, a reverse Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based auction mechanism is proposed for storage resource selection and transaction. Then we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem of how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment. Based on the private chain of Ethereum, we make the simulation for the proposed storage transaction method. The results of simulation show that the proposed transaction model can realize competitive trading of storage resources and ensure the safe and economic operation of resource trading. © 2018 by the authors.},

This makes the validation of closed scripts, i.e. those associated to actual transactions and bearing full information, straightforward. Here we address the problem of validating open scripts, i.e. we address the validation of redeeming scripts against the whole set of possible inputs, i.e. under which general conditions can Bitcoins be redeemed? Even if likely not one of the most complex languages and demanding verification problems, we advocate the merit of formal verification for the Bitcoin validation framework. We propose a symbolic verification theory for open script, a verifier toolkit, and illustrate examples of use on Bitcoin transactions. Contributions include (1) a formalisation of (a fragment of script) the language; (2) a novel symbolic approach to script verification, suitable, e.g. for the verification of newly defined and non-standard payment schemes; and (3) building blocks for a larger verification theory for the developing area of Bitcoin smart contracts. The verification of smart contracts, i.e. agreements built as transaction-based protocols, is currently a problem that is difficult to formalise and computationally demanding. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The application of blockchains techniques in the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining much attention with new solutions proposed in diverse areas of the IoT. Conventionally IoT systems are designed to follow the centralised paradigm where security and privacy control is vested on a 'trusted' third-party. This design leaves the user at the mercy of a sovereign broker and in addition, susceptible to several attacks. The implicit trust and the inferred reliability of centralised systems have been challenged recently following several privacy violations and personal data breaches. Consequently, there is a call for more secure decentralised systems that allows for finer control of user privacy while providing secure communication. Propitiously, the blockchain holds much promise and may provide the necessary framework for the design of a secure IoT system that guarantees fine-grained user privacy in a trustless manner. In this paper, we propose a holistic blockchain-based decentralised model for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment. The nodes in our proposed model utilize smart contracts to define interaction rules while working collaboratively to contribute storage and computing resources. Based on the blockchain technique, our proposed model promotes trustless interaction and enhanced user's privacy through the blockchain-Interplanetary File System (IPFS) alliance. The proposed model also addresses the shortfall of storage constraints exhibited in many IoT systems.  © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate and complete educational records are a valuable asset for people. In recent years, educational records have been digitized. However, there are still two key challenges that have not been resolved. One is to achieve secure and privacy-preserving storage of educational records, while another concern how to realize the sharing of educational records and ensure the security of the sharing process. In this paper, we propose EduRSS, a blockchain-based storage and sharing scheme for educational records is proposed, which combines blockchain, storage servers, and cryptography techniques to create a reliable and safe environment. In our proposal, the blockchain technology is used to ensure the security and reliability of data storage, while the smart contracts on the blockchain are used to regulate the process of storage and sharing. More precisely, the off-chain storage servers store the original educational records in encrypted form, while the hash information of the records is stored on the blockchain. The off-chain records are anchored periodically with the hash information on the blockchain to ensure the security of data storage. Cryptography techniques are utilized to handle records encryption and messages digital signature. To assess the effectiveness of EduRSS, we designed and tested a proof of concept of this scheme. The relative security analysis shows that EduRSS is safe and has a lower computational cost than that of the CP-ABE and the MA-CPABE schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today more and more enterprises and individuals are outsourcing their data to cloud storage system. Data deduplication is one of the important technologies to reduce the storage cost of cloud storage system. In a cloud storage system with deduplication technology, the client can outsource the data files to the cloud storage server and pay for them. Fair payment is one of key issues in the cloud deduplication storage system. At present, a variety of secure deduplication encryption schemes have been designed to protect the privacy of client data. However, most existing fair payment solutions use traditional electronic cash systems to generate payment tokens, which requires a trusted authority to prevent double-spending. Trusted authorities will become bottlenecks in the payment system. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new decentralized fair payment protocol for cloud deduplication storage system by utilizing ethereum blockchain technology. The new protocol takes advantage of the decentralization of blockchain technology, allowing direct transactions without the participation of trusted third parties. In the new protocol, if a malicious situation occurs, the system can guarantee fair payment by pre-storing penalty money in the smart contract. Safety analysis and experimental analysis show that our new protocol is feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming. Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming. The paper offers a case study to design contracts by users. The designed contracts were validated on the existing system to implement the food trading and traders' credit evaluation. The experimental results show that the designed smart contracts achieve good integration with the existing system and they can be deployed and compiled successfully. © 2013 IEEE.},

Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has attracted a broad range of interests from start-ups, enterprises and governments to build next generation applications in a decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy, configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability. © 2019 IEEE.},

Traditional maintenance and renewal of the center node wastes a lot of manpower and material resources and have huge safety implications. This paper proposes a safety equipment diagnosis mechanism based on consortium blockchain technology to realize more efficient, convenient, and secure device maintenance. When a device has problems or notices improper operation, it can make a device diagnosis request in the consortium blockchain network, and receive a diagnosis response from a vendor or non-original supplier nodes. This scheme designs a decentralized safety equipment diagnosis smart contract, combining response node bid price and credit, and applies a multi-dimensional reverse auction mechanism to determine bid node and transaction price. After a smart device diagnosed, the relevant message will be packaged and sent to a smartphone, which can use the client to set up the smart contract of equipment operation policy. Paillier encryption arithmetic can be used to ensure device diagnosis mechanism safety. The proposed scheme is guaranteed not to reveal sensitive information in the process of device interaction. © 2013 IEEE.},

The strategy that maximizes the revenue for each individual DER is the one in which the DER operates at capacity, injecting all available power into the grid. However, when the DER penetration is high and the consumption low, this strategy may lead to power surplus that causes voltage increase over recommended limits. In order to create incentives for the DER to operate below capacity, we propose a proportional-fairness control strategy in which (i) a subset of DERs decrease their own power output, sacrificing the individual revenue, and (ii) the DERs in the subset are dynamically selected based on the record of their control history. The trustworthy implementation of the scheme is carried out through a custom-designed blockchain mechanism that maintains a distributed database trusted by all DERs. In particular, the blockchain is used to stipulate and store a smart contract that enforces proportional fairness.

	abstract = {With the exponential growth in the number of insecure devices, the impact of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is growing rapidly. Existing DDoS mitigation schemes are facing obstacles due to low flexibility, lack of resources, and high cost. The new emerging technologies, such as blockchain, introduce new opportunities for low-cost, efficient and flexible DDoS attacks mitigation across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach, called Cochain-SC, which combines two levels of mitigation, intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. For intra-domain, we propose an effective DDoS mitigation method in the context of software defined networks (SDN); it consists of three schemes: (1) Intra Entropy-based scheme (I-ES) to measure, using sFlow, the randomness of data inside the domain; (2) Intra Bayes-based scheme (I-BS) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate flows; and (3) Intra-domain Mitigation (I-DM) scheme to effectively mitigate illegitimate flows inside the domain. For inter-domain, we propose a collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme based on blockchain; it uses the concept of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum's smart contracts) to facilitate the collaboration among SDN-based domains (i.e., Autonomous System: AS) to mitigate DDoS attacks. For this aim, we design a novel and secure scheme that allows multiple SDN-based domains to securely collaborate and transfer attack information in a decentralized manner. Combining intra-and inter-domain DDoS mitigation, Cochain-SC allows an efficient mitigation along the path of an ongoing attack and an effective mitigation near the origin of the attack. This allows reducing the enormous cost of forwarding packets, across multiple domains, which consist mostly of useless amplified attack traffic. To the best of our knowledge, Cochain-SC is the first scheme that proposes to deal with both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation combining SDN, blockchain and smart contract. The implementation of Cochain-SC is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach; the experimental results show that Cochain-SC achieves flexibility, efficiency, security, cost effectiveness, and high accuracy in detecting illegitimate flows, making it a promising approach to mitigate DDoS attacks. © 2013 IEEE.},

The objective of the analysis is to provide empirical results on smart contracts features, smart contract transactions within the blockchain, the role of the development community, and the source code characteristics. We collected a set of more than 10000 smart contracts source codes and a dataset of meta-data regarding their interaction with the blockchain from etherscan.io. We examined the collected data computing different statistics on naming policies, smart contract ether balance, number of smart contract transactions, functions, and other quantities characterizing the use and purpose of smart contracts. We found that the number of transactions and the balances follow power-law distributions and the software code metrics display, on average, values lower than corresponding metrics in standard software but have high variances. Focusing the attention on the 20 smart contracts with the topmost number of transactions, we found that most of them represent financial smart contracts and some of them have peculiar software development stories behind them. The results show that blockchain software is rapidly changing and evolving and it is no longer devoted only to cryptovalues applications but to general purpose computation. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Biometric authentication, and notably using fingerprints, are now common. Despite its usability, biometrics have however a caveat which is the impossibility of revocation: once the raw fingerprint is breached, and depending on the technology of the reader, it is impossible to stop an illegitimate authentication. This places a focus on auditing both to detect fraud and to have clear indications that the fingerprint has been breached. In this paper we show how to take advantage of the immutability property of Blockchains to design an auditable protocol based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange with applications to fingerprint authentication. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The popularity and applicability of mobile crowdsensing applications are continuously increasing due to the widespread of mobile devices and their sensing and processing capabilities. However, we need to offer appropriate incentives to the mobile users who contribute their resources and preserve their privacy. Blockchain technologies enable semi-anonymous multi-party interactions and can be utilized in crowdsensing applications to maintain the privacy of the mobile users while ensuring first-rate crowdsensed data. In this work, we propose to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts to orchestrate the interactions between mobile crowdsensing providers and mobile users for the case of spatial crowdsensing, where mobile users need to be at specific locations to perform the tasks. Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users’ privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving auction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for high numbers of mobile users and tasks. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In blockchain systems, miners execute transactions in blocks. Since each block has a limit on the number of transactions, miners usually prioritise transactions by selecting the most profitable ones. However, miners are uncertain about the exact income and the exact cost of executing transactions. Thus, they are not able to make informed decisions of which transactions to select and execute in order to maximise their profits. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty that miners perceive about the income and the cost of executing transactions and the impact of this uncertainty on the profit miners can gain. To achieve this aim, we design a simulation model, collect the input data for the model, implement the model and run an experiment on the model. Our simulation results show that the uncertainty miners perceive about the cost of executing transactions has a significant impact on the block profit. On the contrary, our results do not show a significant impact of the income uncertainty on the block profit. © 2018 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of 'pre-verification' is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of blockchains is growing every day, and their utility has greatly expanded from sending and receiving crypto-coins to smart-contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations. Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: From designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service. © 2016 ACM.},

	abstract = {The traditional food supervision system has problems such as lack of industry chain and data fragmentation, which has caused the phenomenon of field regulation to be uncomprehensive in the existing regulatory system and the disposal of response lag. Combining the characteristics of blockchain such as distribution, transparent, and collegiality with the actual needs of regional autonomy, we propose the hierarchical multi-domain blockchain (HMDBC) network structure and the secondary-check mechanism, which can support timely correction and replacement of the malicious supervision nodes by regional nodes co-governance, auxiliary verification of supervision nodes, and arbitration of superior regions. In order to optimize the supervision nodes election, we proposed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of credibility, which can be used to objectively and fairly evaluate the comprehensive reputation of each node in that region by considering various influencing factors of node performance indicators. Furthermore, we designed the data block structure model, which can support the supervisor node replacement. Our system can perform automatic food quality detection and warning of substandard food in the entire industrial chain, with the use of smart contracts combined with the food industry standards. Finally, comparing the complexity of the traditional blockchain system with PBFT consortium, our system is more secure, with lower broadcast complexity. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart Contracts have gained tremendous popularity in the past few years, to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. However, since the release of the Frontier network of Ethereum in 2015, there have been many cases in which the execution of Smart Contracts managing Ether coins has led to problems or conflicts. Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software. In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains.We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps 'unsafe»' programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017). In this study we analyze the source code of Parity and the library, and discuss how recognised best practices could mitigate, if adopted and adapted, such detrimental software misbehavior. We also reflect on the specificity of Smart Contract software development, which makes some of the existing approaches insufficient, and call for the definition of a specific Blockchain Software Engineering. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes Slither, a static analysis framework designed to provide rich information about Ethereum smart contracts. It works by converting Solidity smart contracts into an intermediate representation called SlithIR. SlithIR uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) form and a reduced instruction set to ease implementation of analyses while preserving semantic information that would be lost in transforming Solidity to bytecode. Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review. In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives. We compared tools using a large dataset of smart contracts and manually reviewed results for 1000 of the most used contracts. © 2019 IEEE.},
