	abstract = {Construction supply chains (CSC) are characterized by their converging structure and the hierarchical payment system which is inherently related. Due to the pursuit of diverging goals and mutual interdependencies, risks and trust problems between stakeholders occur. Contracts are used to govern these complex collaborations. To track compliance to contract terms, various activities are executed by involved stakeholders. These activities do not add any value to an end-product, cause intransparency, are costly and cause conflicts. Therefore, a combination of asset tracking and blockchain technology is investigated in this paper to address these problems. A plug-and-play framework of interacting applications and a workflow to operate them are proposed. Proof of this concept is provided by developing prototypical applications and by testing them in various practice-based scenarios. Simplified asset tracking throughout supply chains was realized and linked to smart contracts. This resulted in semi-automated compliance tracking and an immutable record of transactions. Therefore, this work provides more insight into combining asset tracking and blockchain for compliance checking in the construction industry. By doing so, further automation of construction processes, increased transparency between stakeholders and a reduction of conflicts can be enabled. However, it remains clear that many other variables impact on transparency and trust; and while technology can make improvements, considerable procedural security and control measures are needed in addition. Therefore, we focus on semi-automation of workflows using distributed ledger technology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of distributed, multi-perspective conformance checking for Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is addressed. Traditionally, conformance checking has been performed centrally by a trusted entity, however that may not be applicable in the case of collaborative processes between multiple organizations. Consortium Blockchain has been adopted to overcome the need for a trusted entity and foster transparency, accountability, and workflow. Existing blockchain-based conformance checking frameworks focus on translating BPMN models into smart contracts, however they do not support complex BPMN constructs, which limits their applicability in real-life collaborations. In this paper, distributed, multi-perspective conformance checking framework is proposed. This framework supports complex BPMN constructs such as Timers or Boundary processes running on a Consortium blockchain. The proposed framework includes: (1) A process to extract Process Conformance Rules from BPMN models, and (2) A blockchain-based technique to perform checking of the extracted rules to determine process conformance. Furthermore, it can be used by businesses in both after-the-fact checking or during process execution in a transparent and trusted manner. Evaluation of the framework implemented over Quorum conducted with real-life logs proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detecting various violation types in a traceable and transparent manner.},

In this article, we propose a framework for supply chain traceability that preserves privacy from third parties by using smart contracts. In the proposed framework, digital signature and verification are provided by using existing cryptographic techniques in off-chain and on-chain smart contract integration, and it is demonstrated the applicability of architecture by testing. The architecture also provides both anonymity and traceability depending on the user’s request. Finally, thanks to traceability and auditability in the proposed system, customers and other parties can view with a single product ID and also verify with digital signature the claims of the actors in the system.},

In addressing this issue, we develop a blockchain-based framework for managing quality information, referred to as “Product Organization Process (POP) qualityChain”. A Hyperledger-Fabric-based architecture and a series of blockchain solutions (e.g., a POP-model-based quality information structure, a consensus mechanism, smart contracts for processing quality information, authorization sequences, and execution processes) are covered. Finally, we build a prototype system and use a case study to validate our framework. Results show that the proposed framework can decentralize the management of quality information, thereby achieving consistent and secure quality information management. Future work could seek more evidence from practice to further validate our framework.},

	abstract = {E-commerce retail sales have seen significant growth in the past decade with its proliferation into the consumer markets at unprecedented rates. This has led to the rise of logistics companies (LC) and the advent of Logistics financing as a tool used by them to attain business expansion. The current climate in e-commerce that is characterized by an upswing in sales requires the LCs to equip themselves with sufficient capital to elevate or modernize their operational capabilities. But, these small and medium-sized enterprises tend to overlook their business expansion opportunities due to the unfavorable financing environment created due to their: (i) limited tangible assets (ii) lack of clarity on operating capability, and (iii) lack of reliable information-sharing mechanism. To address these problems, this study aims to utilize the digital assets of the LC to aid logistics financing. This study introduces a logistics financing platform (Log-Flock), that leverages the abilities of the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical system (CPS), and blockchain technologies to support the utilization of digital assets of the LC for logistics financing. The IoT and CPS are combined to support the generation of the digital assets whereas the core constructs of blockchain technology, such as the tokens and smart contracts, are used to (i) introduce incentivized rewarding mechanisms to motivate the engagement of users and, (ii) to perform the digital asset valuation and risk assessment in logistics financing. Some of the expected benefits from the study include: (i) This novel platform if implemented, would significantly reduce the time for financing. (ii) It communicates the operating capability of the LCs in the form of credit rating which is easily comprehensible for the financing institutions.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and other forms of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provide an opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.},

	abstract = {Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing studies on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of code with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories, as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls, are found in this paper.},

	abstract = {The management of construction projects requires adequate techniques to support the continual exchange of information across disciplines. Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation. The proposed approach gives stakeholders more confidence when sharing their BIM data, reduces costs, and improves risk contingencies in construction projects. The paper provides a cost analysis to evidence the implications of using Blockchain for BIM data provenance through an experimental framework supported by an Ethereum public test network. A front-end web page has also been created to facilitate interaction with smart contracts and to monitor the BIM data provenance process.},

In the collaborative emergency response, it is important to support various responders with a unified platform to assist in decision-making, distribution of resources, and coordination of emergency operation. In recent years, blockchain has provided strong support for the innovation of emergency management mechanisms with its technical advantages such as distributed storage, decentralization, consensus algorithms, tamper-proof, traceability, and smart contract. This study firstly reviews the development of blockchain and its application in emergency management. Secondly, the connotation and key dilemmas of the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism are expounded from two aspects of the multi-agent participation and the construction of a collaborative mechanism. Then, the possibility of using blockchain to facilitate the innovation of multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism is analyzed from the aspects of emergency management information sharing, resource storage and distribution, the rights and obligations of multiple subjects, supervision, reward and punishment. Finally, a conceptual model of a multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism based on alliance chain and public chain is proposed. The application of blockchain provides a new perspective and motivation for the innovation of emergency management system. This study provides a new method for improving the multi-agent collaborative emergency management mechanism, and is an important supplement and innovation to existing emergency management studies.},

This paper attempts to improve the intelligence, real-timeliness, and security of the direct transaction between DE generation companies (DEGCs) and users, and reduce the default frequency of distributed power (DP) transactions. For these purposes, a P2P DE transaction model for the IIoT was proposed based on blockchain. Firstly, a blockchain-based distributed energy peer-to-peer transaction framework is constructed, which is more suitable for generalized energy transactions based on typical transaction scenarios of the IIoT. Using credit value evaluation and smart contracts to ensure the transparency, openness, and non-tampering of credit scores. On this basis, the energy currency reward mechanism is used to promote the trustworthiness of transaction nodes and maintain transaction security. Finally, the P2P direct transaction based on credit value was designed to improve the transaction efficiency and security. Through case analysis, the DE transaction model for the IIoT, which is based on the credit value of the blockchain, supports fast and frequent energy transactions, as it overcomes the confirmation delays of energy blockchain transactions. The proposed model improves the efficiency of DE transactions in the IIoT, effectively suppresses default frequency, and maintains the order of DE market in the IIoT.},

	abstract = {Electronic health record is an electronic file that records people’s medical treatment and physical examination information in an all-around way which is an important branch of building a smart medical system. The sharing of electronic health records not only helps people use medical resources anytime and anywhere to deal with tricky physical conditions but also provides valuable and true reference materials for medical practitioners in related research. However, the current electronic health record sharing schemes have the problems of electronic health record data leakage, access authorization mechanism incomplete, inflexible operation of electronic health record data, low search efficiency, and untrustworthy cloud server provider. To solve these challenging problems, we propose a new blockchain-based keyword search scheme with dual authorization for electronic health record sharing. The certificateless cryptosystem avoids certificate management and key escrow. The construction of the authorization matrix realizes the dual authorization of the identities of users and the corresponding searchable departments. Also, the matrix can manage the access rights of users. The signal value of the ciphertext index can realize the authority management of ciphertext index. The ciphertext MAC verification code stored in the blockchain can verify the legality of ciphertext, and the smart contract is used to ensure fair transactions. Therefore, our scheme is more suitable for sharing confidential and sensitive electronic health records. The security proof concludes that the proposed scheme is indistinguishability under the keyword guessing attack. Besides, the result of performance analysis and comparison simulations show that the proposed scheme has higher performance than some related schemes.},

In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter’s secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a “block-and-response” mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme.},

Even worse, fixing bugs in a deployed smart contract is difficult, so developers must detect security vulnerabilities in a smart contract before deployment. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection efforts heavily rely on fixed rules defined by experts, which are inefficient and inflexible. To overcome the limitations of existing vulnerability detection approaches, we propose a GNN based approach for smart contract vulnerability detection. First, we construct a graph representation for a smart contract function with syntactic and semantic features by combining abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and program dependency graph (PDG). To further strengthen the presentation ability of our approach, we perform program slicing to normalize the graph and eliminate the redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities. Then, we use a Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural-Network model with hybrid attention pooling to identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contract functions. Empirical results show that our approach can achieve 89.2\% precision and 92.9\% recall in smart contract vulnerability detection on our dataset and reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

It leverages the existing blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control management (including identification, authentication, and authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management (decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to blockchain-based transactive energy systems. The proposed design can help to support machine-to-machine transactions that can be directly integrated into complex grid operations, such as automated market bidding and self-sufficient, resilience-capable grids.},

This article will discuss primarily smart contracts on the blockchain the conclusion and execution of which does not interact with the physical world, as well as briefly touch upon smart contracts on the blockchain which do interact with the physical world. For these smart contracts, it will be determined to what extent existing EU internet laws can help support their development and if not, what is needed to support this. In order to answer this question, the following will be discussed: the rise of e-commerce and in particular the EU internet laws supporting and regulating e-commerce, how smart contracts work and how smart contracts compare with existing technological developments and comparable legal constructs (internet, bank accounts and bank guarantees). Subsequently, it will be explained how the use of smart contracts leads to a shift of confidence, from trust in people to trust in code. On the basis of The DAO hack and the problems that arose, it will be illustrated that this shift to trust in code is not as absolute as is often thought. The article concludes that applying specific EU laws on supporting and regulating e-commerce to smart contracts is difficult for two reasons. First of all, the starting points differ: trust in people versus trust in code. Secondly, technical and practical obstacles often inhibit applying internet laws in a meaningful manner. When using smart contracts, it makes more sense to prevent problems from arising than to correct them afterwards. For this reason, it is advocated that programmers work together with lawyers to create better smart contracts and that the legislator focuses on laws dealing with auditing smart contracts code by trusted third parties and automatically equating smart contracts with written contracts with wet ink signatures. This will hopefully facilitate the rise of smart contracts on the blockchain.},

This paper addresses the research question of whether and how can blockchain contribute to improving CCA and what are the specific challenges to its adoption in CCA. The study adopts a systematic review of studies in this domain and their subsequent analysis against a CCA framework. Most applications were found to be centered on two CCA functions; the financial management, and the document and record management. CCA functions that embed complex contractual logics such as claims and disputes resolution management have received scant attention. To advance blockchain application in CCA, a structured roadmap of its key challenges relating to technology, process, policy and society is proposed for future research. The outcome of this paper provides scholars, practitioners and policymakers, interested in construction contracts, with the evidence about the current level of blockchain contribution to CCA and a structured set of recommendations for future research.},

Peers (data owners) can rent the local idle disk space and large bandwidth of other peers (lessors) to store personal data and achieve fine-grained data retrieval in a distributed manner without the burden of local storage and maintenance. However, after data outsourcing, data owners no longer have physical possession of the data and face the risk of not being able to efficiently access the data. To solve the above issues, DStore employs smart contracts to audit the integrity of the outsourced data and develop a multikeyword retrieval module to support efficient access by data owners. In DStore, smart contracts can efficiently audit outsourced data without additional communication overhead for data owners; smart contracts and lessors do not compromise the privacy of data owners. Finally, we conduct an extensive security and performance analysis to ensure that DStore is secure and feasible.},

	abstract = {Industrial applications often require federated cloud services from multiple providers to improve reliability and flexibility. Traditional selection methods through auctions usually involve a centralized auctioneer to coordinate the auction procedure. Blockchain and smart contracts provide a decentralized mechanism to automate the cloud auction process; however, existing solutions fail in the selection of the most suitable providers and the violation detection of the signed auction agreements, which are also known as service-level agreements (SLAs). To tackle these problems, we propose an integrated auction model using Bayesian game theory and blockchain techniques. The proposed model is enhanced with two Bayesian Nash Equilibriums (BNEs); the first BNE enables the selection of cost-effective providers to construct the federated cloud services, while the second BNE ensures consistent and trustworthy monitoring of federated SLAs. Moreover, a timed message submission (TMS) algorithm is proposed to protect the auction privacy during the message submission phase. This paper validates the equilibrium results of two BNEs and implements the proposed model on the Ethereum blockchain. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness of our model.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts are currently en vogue, thanks to the infrastructure provided by the blockchain technology. However, their effective use requires that the textual (legalese) specification of the contract be accompanied by a precise computational definition of the actions leading to its satisfaction or breach, as well as of their admissible sequences. Insofar as contracts can be viewed as prescribing transactional exchanges of well-specified resources among well-specified actors, contract execution can be modelled as following some protocol in a closed world. This suggests a modelling of such executions as interactive processes in reaction systems, where the entities in the background set represent possible allocations of resources to actors and reactions describe changes in such allocations. We use this type of reaction systems and interactive processes as a basis for the modelling of transactions and contracts and explore properties of such processes, highlighting their peculiarities with respect to the original notion of interactive processes in reaction systems. We also discuss several constructions for composition and decomposition of processes, which guarantee equivalence of effects: two interactive processes are equivalent if, starting from the same initial set of allocations, they produce the same final set of allocations.},

A concurrent mixed-method design was adopted to (a) identify the industry's perspective on what advanced technologies can be accepted to address SOP issues through a questionnaire survey, and (b) identify the use of advanced technologies through a live construction project as a case study. Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done.

	abstract = {The cloud computing technology has emerged, developed, and matured in recent years, consequently commercializing remote outsourcing storage services. An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved. Finally, we implement the protocols, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol.},

Special vehicles (e.g. police cars, ambulances and fire trucks) often encounter traffic jams when carrying out emergency tasks, which may lead to unexpected consequences (e.g. causing serious damage to our routine and property). In order to ensure that special vehicles can quickly pass through crowded road and arrive at the accident scene in time, this paper proposes a blockchain-based special vehicles priority access guarantee scheme (BSV-PAGS). In BSV-PAGS, we introduce blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT), and construct a decentralized distributed edge node network based on blockchian, which guarantees the information sharing among the edge nodes as well as processing the data efficiently. The intelligent terminal device will upload the special vehicle information to the edge node in the blockchain, and then the uploaded information will sync to each edge node through the information sharing smart contract, realizing the information sharing among the edge nodes. In addition, we use machine learning method (e.g. Bag of Visual Words and Support Vector Machine) to design and train special vehicle detectors to improve the recognition accuracy of special vehicles. We design a special vehicle priority access smart contract to achieve real-time scheduling of vehicles and ultimately ensure the priority of special vehicles. Then, we carried out a security analysis of BSV-PAGS. Finally, we test a large number of simulation experiments based on Ethereum clients.

	abstract = {The rationality and scientific nature of the emission trading mechanism is the key to the effective implementation of environmental and economic policies. As far as China is concerned, there are phenomena such as information asymmetry, low supervision efficiency, and alienation of government and enterprise behaviors caused by the incomplete mechanism of emission trading in the practice of different pilots. The introduction of blockchain technology can innovate the traditional transaction model and form a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction and a trusted emission trading market. To this end, based on the current emission trading mechanism and the characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper couples the core technologies of blockchain with the functional requirements of application scenarios. Then, an innovative application framework is built based on the consortium blockchain Fabric from three aspects: emission trading supervision, secondary trading market construction, as well as emission trading incentive and punishment mechanisms. Technologies such as the consensus mechanism, smart contract, Merkle tree and asymmetric encryption are comprehensively applied in this process. In the construction of the blockchain framework of the secondary market for emission trading, institutional changes and innovations brought about by the blockchain at various levels are analyzed in terms of participants, transaction processes and the transaction scope. At the same time, smart contract functions and algorithms are designed for the purchase, transfer-out and trading of emission rights, and the operation business logic of the smart contract is analyzed. On the whole, this paper explores the application framework of blockchain technology in the field of emission trading at the macro level, and analyzes the application mechanism of the corresponding technologies of blockchain at each coupling point in the framework at the micro level. The collaborative analysis at the two levels shows that blockchain technology and the requirements of emission trading mechanism can be effectively coupled, and the application of blockchain technology can promote the effective supervision of enterprises' emission behavior, making the processes of the purchase, transfer and transaction of emission rights intelligent and automated, and providing technical support for cross-regional emission trading to reduce transaction costs and management complexity. In addition, the issuance of emission credits based on smart contract will be a new incentive for companies to actively participate in transactions. Based on the above analysis, this paper believes that the innovative application of blockchain technology is of great significance in the promotion of the market-based allocation of element of emission trading and the rational allocation of environmental resources. It will lead to a major breakthrough in the traditional trading system in terms of trading modes, forming a value transmission network of environmental resources between the government and polluters.},

	abstract = {As the turnkey project adheres to the concept of one-stop delivery, it puts forward higher requirements for rapid construction of manufacturing systems. During the implementation of the turnkey project in the I4.0 workshop, there is a lack of unified construction and delivery standards under the system configuration framework that meets information security. Therefore, according to the I4.0 manufacturing requirements of node scalability, trusted delivery and standard information modeling in the turnkey process, the paper proposes a reference information architecture of blockchain-driven turnkey project to establish a turnkey service system with AAS as the delivery core: (1) Take RAMI4.0 and I4.0 component as the engineering construction framework and supporting technology, by analyzing the bottleneck of blockchain in solving the I4.0 workshop, integrating the open blockchain architecture interoperability characteristics of BC-Based smart contract and Tangle-Based extensible IIoT-node, and establish complete solution to turnkey project information architecture under the I4.0 workshop; (2) Combined with the current turnkey project, this paper proposes and studies the AAS modeling method supporting blockchain verification and the delivery constraint mechanism based on smart contract, and designs the blockchain-based architecture, operation and implementation process with AAS as the delivery core; (3) Through the development and integration of key technologies, an experimental development and operation case of the turnkey project of the I4.0 workshop customized production line is given, which provides theoretical and technical references for more SMEs to quickly integrate into the turnkey project system.},

	abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties involved, which often leads to “adversarial relationships”, “risk avoidance”, and a “lack of trust” among the different actors. This culture is further compounded by a “linear workflow” that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration.},

In order to solve the issue that the Hyperledger Fabric does not currently support Chinese Commercial Cryptographic (CCC) algorithms, we extended the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP) module in the Hyperledger Fabric by upgrading the original BCCSP module to support the CCC algorithms SM2 and SM3. Furthermore, we designed a transaction process by using UBCCSP (Upgraded BCCSP), and a new smart contract also has been presented. After that, an improved consortium blockchain information system based on UBCCSP named UCBIS (Consortium Blockchain Information System based on UBCCSP) is proposed. In the Hyperledger Fabric transaction process, the identity information and transaction data are protected by the SM2 and SM3 algorithms, moreover, SM3 is also used in the construction process of smart contracts. Our smart contracts reduce the total data amount and improve query efficiency. Finally, the information query system based on UBCCSP is implemented. After being tested and analyzed, the average time for every query is only 31.162 ms in the blockchain system, which has better performance and higher query efficiency.},

This paper challenges that claim. I argue that because of the need for adaptation to mutable and unpredictable occurrences (a chief challenge of transaction cost economics à la Oliver Williamson), smart contracts may incur higher transaction costs than traditional contracts. This paper focuses on two problems related to the adaptation: first, smart contracts are constructed to limit and potentially avoid any ex-post legal intervention, including efficiency-enhancing adaptation by courts. Second, the consensus mechanism on which every smart contract depends may lead to additional transaction costs due to a majority-driven adaptation of the blockchain that follows Mancur Olson's Logic of groups. The paper further proposes several institutional expedients that may reduce these transaction costs of smart contracts.},

	abstract = {The immutable nature of Ethereum transactions, and consequently Ethereum smart-contracts, has stimulated the proliferation of many approaches aiming at detecting defects and security issues before the deployment of smart-contracts on the blockchain. Indeed, the actions performed by smart-contracts instantiated on the blockchain, possibly involving substantial financial value, cannot be undone. Unfortunately, smart-contracts source code is not always available, hence approaches based on static analysis have very often to face the problem of inspecting the compiled Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, retrieved directly from the blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of EVM bytecode (especially in jumps address resolution), the state-of-the-art static analysis-based solutions have poor accuracy in the automated detection of Ethereum smart-contracts programming defects and vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel approach based on symbolic execution of the EVM operands stack that allows to resolve jumps address in the EVM bytecode and to construct a precise Control-Flow Graph (CFG) of compiled smart-contracts. Many static analysis techniques are based on a CFG-based representation of the smart-contract to validate, and would therefore benefit from our approach. We have implemented the CFG reconstruction algorithm in a tool called EtherSolve . Then, we have validated the tool on a large dataset of real-world Ethereum smart-contracts, showing that EtherSolve extracts more precise CFGs, w.r.t. state-of-the-art available approaches. Finally, we have extended EtherSolve with two detectors for two of the most prominent Ethereum smart-contracts vulnerabilities (Reentrancy and Tx.origin). Experimental results show that exploiting the proposed CFG reconstruction static analysis, leads to more accurate vulnerabilities detection, w.r.t. state-of-the-art security tools.

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted for design collaboration in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, while its centralized paradigm suffers the risk of data manipulation. To this end, blockchain is an emerging distributive technology that guarantees data authenticity and integrity by providing decentralized, immutable, and traceable data storage. However, directly integrating BIM with blockchain risks leaking sensitive data, since a blockchain is a transparent network insofar as shared information (including sensitive data) can be disclosed to all members without access control. Therefore, this paper proposes a confidentiality-minded framework (CMF) for blockchain-based design collaboration. The major innovations are twofold. First, an access control model is developed in the CMF to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive BIM data in a blockchain ledger. Second, new design strategies are developed in CMF to facilitate design coordination within the access-controlled blockchain network. An illustrative design example validates the feasibility and performance of the proposed CMF, which has acceptable latency and storage cost. The results also show that the sensitive BIM data are effectively kept confidential when project members collaborate within the CMF.},

The high degree of fragmentation and the reliance on financial institutions has pushed the physical and financial supply chains apart. The paper demonstrates how blockchain-based crypto assets address this limitation when used for conditioning payments on the flow of products. The integration of flows is contrasted in today's supply chains and those using crypto assets for their payment settlement. The thesis is validated in two construction projects where a smart contract administered payments in crypto currencies and crypto tokens. The findings reveal that crypto assets can enhance both the granularity and the atomicity of the integration between the cash and product flows; the on- and off-chain realities can be directly linked in crypto asset-enabled supply chains. The paper concludes with a discussion of risks such as regulatory landscapes, security, and price volatility and offers potential solutions.},

This study introduces a novel information exchange and management system for construction firms based on blockchain technology and chatbots. The system leverages the characteristics of blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer operation mode, data integrity, structuring, and privacy, and the chatbots' merits regarding ease of use and degree of automation. The system is developed for tracking work progress in construction projects as a generic use-case using a four-step approach. First, a private blockchain network is configured for data distribution and storage. Second, a smart contract is coded for regulating data writing/reading operations. Third, a chatbot is developed for data collection and retrieval through textual conversations. Fourth, serverless cloud function and cloudant database are configured to allow the linkage between the blockchain network and the chatbot. A prototype of the system is built and applied to a case study of non-residential construction project to test and verify its capabilities. Further, the system's performance is assessed in terms of the writing and reading latencies and the storage size.

	abstract = {Context: Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, we present our second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7\% lucid and 72.2\% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3\% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping. Conclusion: iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.},

Although academicians and practitioners agree that information sharing is imperative to improve SCT, it is unclear whether and how organizations can take advantage of blockchain technology to manage information sharing when collaborating with partners and competitors in a dynamic supply chain while maintaining privacy and confidentiality. In this study, we attempt to address this issue by building multiple assets and chains with multiple processes, facilitating data aggregation, and maintaining information confidentiality. To achieve these objectives, this study proposes a multi-asset, multichain framework and builds a permissioned blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric. By constructing “channels” under the proposed framework, this study demonstrates that firms can share information privately and confidentially with partners and competitors in a supply chain and simultaneously improve SCT. Overall, the results obtained from the proof-of-concept analysis suggest that the proposed framework outperforms the public blockchain in terms of information sharing and SCT perspectives.},

We propose a blockchain-based data-sharing framework called EdgeShare for edge data-sharing services among heterogeneous network domains by introducing a two-layer overlay network topology and an edge computing paradigm that can dramatically alleviate system pressure and reduce communication delays to improve data-sharing efficiency. Under such framework, a novel smart contract is designed to construct access control strategies with dissimilar granularities to achieve different levels of data access control in an undeniable and automated manner. All IIoT data-sharing activities are recorded in a blockchain for secured transaction logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeShare prototype and conduct extensive experiments and analyses to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals. In contrast with centralized sharing methods, results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of massive data sharing while introducing reasonable and acceptable overheads.},

	abstract = {With the prevalence of blockchain technology, Ethereum, as the second-largest blockchain, with the capabilities of running smart contracts, grows fast. A user on the Ethereum platform can implement smart contracts as well as remit its cryptocurrency. Cyber-attacks often target cryptocurrency. Besides, Ethereum may be exploited by malicious users for launching attacks. Therefore, the demand for Ethereum network supervision is increasing. To protect interior users on Ethereum from attacks, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should supervise the Ethereum traffic from or to its internal users. Ethereum traffic identification is the first step towards supervision. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer communication network implemented by DEVp2p. DEVp2p is designed to realize data interaction and adopts encryption to enhance anonymity on Ethereum. It is difficult to identify Ethereum traffic accurately at line speed in a high-speed network. So far, Ethereum traffic identification has not been explored yet. This paper designs an efficient Ethereum traffic identification system with high identification accuracy, dubbed ETI (Ethereum Traffic Identification), for an ISP to supervise its internal users on Ethereum without Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). ETI first constructs an active node library consisting of core nodes on Ethereum and active Ethereum peers in the ISP. Then potential Ethereum flows are filtered by checking if their sources or destinations are in the active node library. As active Ethereum nodes may generate non-Ethereum traffic, machine learning classifiers are further adopted to judge if the potential Ethereum traffic is actually from Ethereum. The classification is based on the unique packet/payload-length and port number-related traffic features on Ethereum implemented by DEVp2p. Our experimental studies validate that ETI outperforms state-of-the-art network traffic classification methods in identification accuracy and time efficiency. ETI achieves an identification accuracy of 0.9998 and relatively high time efficiency.},

In the framework, two smart contracts, named search smart contract(SSC) and verify smart contract(VSC), are constructed based on Ethereum blockchain, which are used to match the user’s trapdoor with index and check the correctness of search results. To improve the search accuracy, we realizes a ranking multi-keyword search where it only returns the top-k documents which best meet the user’s needs. Additionally, a new attribute-based encryption(ABE) is introduced to keep confidentiality and access authority of the sharing data. And the proposed ABE supports the hiding policy which solves the privacy protection during the data share. For reducing the computing burden of the data user, the decrypted-cloud service assistant system is proposed. Security proof and performance comparisons prove the security and efficiency of the scheme.},

Firstly, an obstacle index system with 11 barriers is determined from three aspects of application, technology and legal policy. Secondly, a quantitative analysis model is constructed with (IT2TrFN), improved hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMA℡) and interpretive structural modeling (ISM). And the K-means method is employed to optimize the discrimination of influence relations among indicators. Then, the model is applied in a case study to testify its applicability.

	abstract = {One of the fundamental problems that hinders the current blockchain systems for industrial use is scalability. Lightning Network has been proposed to address this challenge, which executes massive amount of transactions off-chain via pre-constructed payment channels, and only records the final state when a payment channel is closed. However, current Lightning Network heavily rely on the single path payment. When the payment value exceeds the deposit of each individual path, the customer has to close all the existing payment channels and construct a new one from scratch, which we term as the overload issue. In addition, the single path payment bears the inherent risk of sensitive information (e.g., payment value) leaking. In this paper, we propose a multi-path off-chain payment mechanism, termed Rapido, which explicitly addresses the overload and privacy leaking issues by splitting and distributing payment to multiple paths. Specifically, a new smart contract, D-HTLC, is equipped with Rapido to encode multi-path payment protocol. We also theoretically prove that the VDP (Value Distributing Problem) is NP-hard. Finally, extensive experiments show that our approach not only resolves the overload issue but also mitigates the skewness of payment channels. Quantitative results further reveal that with the restriction of no adding new payment channels, the success rate of Rapido is more than 3 times higher than that of the Lightning Network. The implementation will be released upon acceptance.},

The protection of personal sensory information privacy in the smart home has gotten more attention. To enable secure data sharing under the scenario of the smart home, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been applied widely. As a general rule, the sophisticated calculation of ABE is difficult under resource-constrained devices. The appearance of edge computing alleviates this dilemma, where an edge server (ES) is responsible for computing all heavy cryptographic operations and uploading massive device data to a cloud. Nevertheless, the ES and the cloud may be attacked artificially in reality. Accordingly, to check the correctness of the ES data and the integrity of the cloud data, we design a lightweight dual auditing scheme, where the first adopts the aggregation of data blocks and signatures to check the integrity of the cloud data, and the second constructs an efficient Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof to verify the correctness of the ES data in a lightweight way. To prevent collusion attacks, the legitimacy of the data user is authenticated by a smart contract. The simulation experiment shows that our multiple auditing scheme is relatively efficient.},

However, such potential cannot be achieved without blockchain “oracles” needed to bridge the on-chain (i.e., blockchain system) and off-chain (i.e., real-life physical project) worlds. This study presents an innovative solution that exploits smart construction objects (SCOs). It develops a SCOs-enabled blockchain oracles (SCOs-BOs) framework. To instantiate this framework, the system architecture of a blockchain-enabled construction supply chain management (BCSCM) system is developed and validated using a case study, whereby four primary smart contracts are examined in the context of off-site logistics and on-site assembly services. The validation results show that accurate data is retrieved against malicious data in each request, and the corresponding reputation scores are successfully recorded. The innovativeness of the research lies in two aspects. In addition to mobilizing SCOs as blockchain oracles to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds, it develops a decentralized SCO network to avoid the single point of failure (SPoF) problem widely existing in blockchain systems. This study contributes to existing research and practice to harness the power of blockchain in construction.},

	abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.},

Ethereum is currently the largest platform for smart contracts, and anomaly detection is imminent. However, the data related to smart contracts is huge and contains complex objects and relationships. It is impossible to extract high-order attributes and low efficiency using traditional methods. The key to reduce fraud is extracting features from complex smart contracts and effectively identifying abnormal contracts. Therefore, this paper constructs a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Networks (S\_HGTNs) suitable for smart contract anomaly detection to detect financial fraud on the Ethereum platform. For feature representation, this paper first extracts the features to construct a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) for smart contract, and uses the relationship matrix obtained from the meta-path learned in the transformer network as the input of the convolution network, and finally uses the node embedding for classification tasks. The classification results show that this model performs better than the traditional model and the standard deviation is small, which proves the effectiveness and stability of the model.},

Ethereum is currently the second blockchain platform by market capitalization, it’s also the largest smart contract blockchain platform. Smart contracts can simplify and accelerate the development of various applications, but they also bring some problems. For example, smart contracts are used to commit fraud, vulnerability contracts are deliberately developed to undermine fairness, and there are numerous duplicative contracts that waste performance with no actual purpose. In this paper, we propose a transaction-based classification and detection approach for Ethereum smart contract to address these issues. We collected over 10,000 smart contracts from Ethereum and focused on the data behavior generated by smart contracts and users. We identified four behavior patterns from the transactions by manual analysis, which can be used to distinguish the difference between different types of contracts. Then 14 basic features of a smart contract are constructed from these. To construct the experimental dataset, we propose a data slicing algorithm for slicing the collected smart contracts. After that, we use an LSTM network to train and test our datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our approach can distinguish different types of contracts and can be applied to anomaly detection and malicious contract identification with satisfactory precision, recall, and f1-score.},

Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen smart contracts are getting increasingly popular in building trustworthy decentralized applications. Previous research has proposed static and dynamic techniques to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. These tools check vulnerable contracts against several predefined rules. However, the emerging new vulnerable types and programming skills to prevent possible vulnerabilities emerging lead to a large number of false positive and false negative reports of tools. To address this, we propose Vulpedia, which mines expressive vulnerability signatures from contracts. Vulpedia is based on the relaxed assumption that the owner of contract is not malicious. Specifically, we extract structural program features from vulnerable and benign contracts as vulnerability signatures, and construct a systematic detection method based on detection rules composed of vulnerability signatures. Compared with the rules defined by state-of-the-arts, our approach can extract more expressive rules to achieve better completeness (i.e., detection recall) and soundness (i.e., precision). We further evaluate Vulpedia with four baselines (i.e., Slither, Securify, SmartCheck and Oyente) on the testing dataset consisting of 17,770 contracts. The experiment results show that Vulpedia achieves best performance of precision on 4 types of vulnerabilities and leading recall on 3 types of vulnerabilities meanwhile exhibiting the great efficiency performance.},

	abstract = {Deduplication scheme based on convergent encryption (CE) is widely-used in cloud storage system to eliminate redundant data. However, the adversaries can obtain the data by the brute-force attack, if the data belongs to a predictable set for CE. In addition, previous works usually introduce the third-party auditors to execute the data integrity verification, suffering from data disclosure by the auditors. In this paper, we propose a secure authorized deduplication scheme based on blockchain, which can ensure the confidentiality and security of the users' data stored on cloud servers. In our scheme, the users can utilize the smart contract to create a tamper-proofing ledger, which can protect the data from illegal modification. Meanwhile, the users can execute the integrity audit protocols to check the users’ data integrity by the smart contract. Moreover, a hierarchical role hash tree (HRHT) will be constructed to create the role key when the users upload their data to CSP, allowing the authorized users to access the data. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposed scheme is resilient against the brute-force attack and the collusion attack, while it has limited computation overhead.},

Information technologies are used for MiC fit-out management and heterogeneous digital twins are generated. However, flexible collaboration of digital twins is hard to achieve and synchronized information sharing among transdisciplinary stakeholders is also hindered by “Islands of Information”. Therefore, this paper develops a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform for MiC fit-out operations. Firstly, Integrated Domain-Driven Design (IDDD) model is proposed for information integration and interoperation in cross-domain construction projects. Secondly, based on IDDD, digital twins in various domains are integrated for seamless and transparent collaboration in MiC fit-out. Thirdly, Petri net-based workflow model is applied for collaboration of multi-domain digital twins under versioning smart contract, where net structure and behavior attributes facilitate the automatic control during off-site and on-site MiC fit-out processes.},

	abstract = {The on-site safety inspection is an essential procedure to ensure tower cranes’ safety in the usage stage by finding equipment defects (e.g., loose bolts) and potential environmental hazards (e.g., poor ground conditions) in advance. However, the following two issues should be tackled to secure its effectiveness: (1) how to guarantee the execution of safety inspections, especially under a tight construction schedule? and (2) how to ensure the inspection information is immutable, transparent, and traceable? This research, guided by the design science approach, aimed to develop a blockchain-enabled framework for assuring the effectiveness of on-site safety inspection of tower cranes (OSITC). First, a literature review was conducted to identify OSITC challenges and blockchain potential. Then, a blockchain-based conceptual framework was provided, with two major components: smart contracts and the consensus process, being discussed. Finally, using the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, a prototype system was developed to instantiate and test the proposed framework. The findings suggest that the blockchain can protect the OSITC’s effectiveness by allowing safety inspections to be automatically executed via smart contracts and providing relevant stakeholders with trustworthy inspection records via consensus algorithms. This study provides a novel solution for tower crane safety management to construction researchers and practitioners, inspiring more discussions about blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs’ difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.},

	abstract = {Integrated project delivery (IPD) in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry relies on risk/reward sharing and deferral of parties' profit payments until all project activities are completed. A decentralised, automated and secured financial platform is needed to enable all parties to control and track financial transactions, with no unauthorised changes allowed. The new technology, blockchain, enables data to be recorded, has no network participant with dominant power and manages data using specific functions, in line with smart contracts. The present study is the first to develop a framework proposing blockchain technology utilisation in IPD projects. The framework would enable core project team members to automatically execute all financial transactions, through coding the three main transactions of IPD projects: reimbursed costs, profit and cost saving, as functions of the IPD smart contract. To demonstrate the proposed framework's applicability, a “proof of concept” is developed and validated through an IPD case project. The practicality of the built-up hyperledger network (IBM® Blockchain Cloud Beta 2) and the advantages of the proposed smart contract functions are examined. The user-friendliness of the proposed financial system and its efficiency in automating all transactions are demonstrated. No deficiency is found in the blockchain network components. The study's findings, applied in a favourable external context, would facilitate IPD adoption and use across the AEC industry by providing a workable solution to existing financial barriers. The findings extend the horizon for further research on exploring blockchain's capabilities to solve comparable deficiencies to those affecting the AEC industry.},

Big data market can carry out efficient data trading, which provides a way to share data and further enhances the utility of data. However, to realize effective data trading in big data market, several challenges need to be resolved. The first one is to verify the data availability for a data consumer. The second is privacy of a data provider who is unwilling to reveal his real identity to the data consumer. The third is the payment fairness between a data provider and a data consumer with atomic exchange. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new blockchain-based fair data trading protocol in big data market. The proposed protocol integrates ring signature, double-authentication-preventing signature and similarity learning to guarantee the availability of trading data, privacy of data providers and fairness between data providers and data consumers. We show the proposed protocol achieves the desirable security properties that a secure data trading protocol should have. The implementation results with Solidity smart contract demonstrate the validity of the proposed blockchain-based fair data trading protocol.},

In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method.

	abstract = {Data leakage in electronic health records (EHRs) could result in the compromise of patient privacy (e.g. medical conditions). Generally most data in EHRs remain unchanged once they are uploaded to the system; thus, blockchain can be potentially used to facilitate the sharing of such data. Different participating medical organizations and individuals (e.g. medical practitioners, hospitals, medical labs and insurance companies) can then access EHRs stored on the blockchain with a higher level of confidence. In this paper, a blockchain based searchable encryption scheme for EHRs is proposed. The index for EHRs is constructed through complex logic expressions and stored in the blockchain, so that a data user can utilize the expressions to search the index. As only the index is migrated to the blockchain to facilitate propagation, the data owners have full control over who can see their EHRs data. The use of blockchain technology ensures the integrity, anti-tampering, and traceability of EHRs’ index. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated from two aspects, namely in terms of the overhead for extracting the document IDs from EHRs and the overhead associated with conducting transactions on smart contract in Ethereum.},

	abstract = {On-site construction environmental monitoring (OCEM) can help to govern the behaviors of construction stakeholders in terms of pollutant emissions and environmental protection. Current OCEM systems, nevertheless, were built utilizing a centralized architecture, such as the government's local database, which leads to information imbalance and disputes among multiple stakeholders. When there are no trustworthy data records to justify construction companies' compliance, for example, arguments or even conflicts may emerge between neighboring residents and the contractors. Blockchain has the potential to be a reliable platform for environmental monitoring due to its decentralization, immutability, transparency, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. However, there has been limited investigation into the blockchain's possibilities in OCEM. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled framework for OCEM. To begin, an overall conceptual framework was created, in which construction pollutant data was collected via sensors and then uploaded to the blockchain network. Then, based on the consensus algorithm, the on-chained information flow was introduced. Smart contracts were programmed to automatically monitor the level of construction pollutants and evaluate environmental performance. Finally, a case study was carried out to validate the theoretical viability of the proposed framework in a laboratory environment, in which a blockchain prototype based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture was presented. The results indicate that blockchain can assist OCEM by supplying trustworthy environmental data and allowing for continuous monitoring.

	abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that enables transactional consensus among untrusted nodes. Due to the independence between blockchains, it is tough to complete asset exchange tasks between diverse chains. Facing this problem, multiple cross-chain exchange schemes were proposed, but they have not been widely used due to various defects in terms of compatibility, flexibility, security, and practicability. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive cross-chain exchange system called Practical AgentChain. Various coins can be mapped to the corresponding tokens on Practical AgentChain for trading. One or multiple trading operators can spontaneously form a service deposit pool on existing blockchains and register a trading group for profit using the well-designed smart contract called Agent Contract. All the trading groups competitively provide cross-chain exchange services. Clients with exchange currency requirements can freely select an appropriate trading group to request services, such as mapping assets to tokens or withdraw tokens. The choice of the trading group is made according to the group’s deposit and the group members’ reputation recorded on the Agent Contract. This system also incorporates Town crier as the reliable Data Oracle system for obtaining the status of cross-chain transactions and combines a matching exchange protocol to ensure the fairness of on-chain token exchange. In addition, we design an impartial service arbitration mechanism and a deposit allocation scheme to ensure the reliability of the system. Through security analysis, our system can resist re-use attacks, denial-of-service attacks and resolve service availability issues. We modify the Town crier adaptively and combine it with Ethereum to implement the simulation. The experimental results show that Practical AgentChain is efficient and low-cost. Besides, our system can be deployed on any existing blockchain that supports smart contracts since the system’s architecture is highly portable.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a continuous delivery/continuous verifiability (CD/CV) method for IoT dataflows in edge–fog–cloud. A CD model based on extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) mechanism as well as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction, enable end-users to create efficient schemes for the continuous verification and validation of the execution of applications in edge–fog–cloud infrastructures. This scheme also verifies and validates established execution sequences and the integrity of digital assets. CV model converts ETL and DAG into business model, smart contracts in a private blockchain for the automatic and transparent registration of transactions performed by each application in workflows/pipelines created by CD model without altering applications nor edge–fog–cloud workflows. This model ensures that IoT dataflows delivers verifiable information for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes with certainty. A containerized parallelism model solves portability issues and reduces/compensates the overhead produced by CD/CV operations. We developed and implemented a prototype to create CD/CV schemes, which were evaluated in a case study where user mobility information is used to identify interest points, patterns, and maps. The experimental evaluation revealed the efficiency of CD/CV to register the transactions performed in IoT dataflows through edge–fog–cloud in a private blockchain network in comparison with state-of-art solutions.},

	abstract = {A key component of blockchain technology is the ledger, viz., a database that, unlike standard databases, keeps in memory the complete history of past transactions as in a notarial archive for the benefit of any future test. In second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum, the ledger is coupled with smart contracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with agreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The coupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background for very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only focus of first generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin. However, the currently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming constructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited maliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We propose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by formalizing a notion of contract modeled as a finite-state automaton with well-defined computational characteristics derived from encoding in terms of allocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on programming. To complete the work, we use temporal logic as the basis for an abstract query language that is effectively suited to the historical nature of the information kept in the ledger.},

Although blockchain is considered a potential solution for these concerns, the pension industry has not fully leveraged this disruptive technology. This paper provides a blueprint for a blockchain-based end-to-end digital transformation of the pension industry. First, we identified the pre-requisites for blockchain adoption in pension. Then, we developed an architectural design of blockchain-based re-designed pension business processes. Subsequently, we elaborated on how smart contracts can make pension transactions in such redesigned processes optimized, automated, and error-free. Finally, we presented how blockchain can be integrated with the existing pension IT systems, using an API layer, to enable seamless onboarding of all pension participants to a single digital platform – a critical ask for any blockchain implementation. We concluded with an elucidation of the potential of such blockchain-based digital transformation of the pension industry in reducing turnaround time, lowering operating expenses, and facilitating the achievement of other pension reform agendas. This architecture of a blockchain-enabled pension network represents a flexible and scalable knowledge construct that can act as a foundation for further investigations by pension regulators or pension industry participants interested in achieving technology-driven pension operations reforms.},

With a game theory model based on an integrated framework of crime theories, we find that beneficial claims of financial inclusivity and pseudonymity of permissionless DeFi come with a cost of vulnerability to cyberattacks due to its incompliance with AML regulations among prosumers. In contrast, cyberattackers can be deterred from attacking AML-compliant permissioned DeFi. These results have important implications for trust as a construct within the context of blockchain-based sharing economy and institutional roles played by decentralized governance and smart contract auditors in creating a “trustless” state-space without forfeiting cybersecurity of a blockchain-based sharing economy. We also provide cybersecurity policy suggestions for permissionless DeFi without sacrificing its decentralized nature.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts are measures to speed up the diffusion of circular economy into construction processes. Nevertheless, integrated solutions that cover all the aspects of circular supply chain including network structure, business processes, and the products are still missing. This paper is an attempt to bridge this gap, through offering a workable solution to address the disconnected nature of blockchain adoption across construction procedures. Informed by the overall approach of design science research (DSR), the solution is created following the five-staged procedure of DSR: (1) problem identification, (2) treatment suggestion, (3) treatment design, (4) evaluation and (5) conclusion. Findings establish that the proposed solution is novel in several ways; it: (1) enables construction practitioners to share their building components information on a safe and immutable medium; (2) enables government authorities (i.e., city council) to track the treatment and delivery of hazardous products/materials; (3) supports the upstream circular economy design through fostering collaboration among ‘designers to designers’ and ‘designers to asset owners’ in a blockchain network; and (4) supports developing ‘a bank of reusable BIM families’, encouraging designers to use these items in their designs. Apart from these contributions, this study provides some fertile ground for future research. Chief among all: future studies can provide fully automated systems through integrating the solution presented here with the Internet of Things (IoT); and researchers that validate the workability of the proposed solution across various contexts and real-life projects in exposure to various settings and peculiarities.},

It uses comparative empirical experiments (Charrette Test Method) to draw comparisons between the visibility of state-of-practice and blockchain-enabled payment systems in a commercial construction project. Comparisons were drawn across four levels of granularity. The findings are threefold: 1) blockchain improved information completeness and information accuracy compared with the digital state-of-practice solution; 2) the improvements were significantly more pronounced for information queries that had higher product, trade, and temporal granularity; and 3) blockchain-enabled solution was robust when faced with more granular information queries, while the conventional solution experienced 50\% and 66.7\% decline respectively in completeness and accuracy of information.

Such changes however do not sufficiently account for circumstances of hardship, or black-swan events such as COVID-19, whereby the relative losers of trading arrangements should continue to receive outcomes which are not only efficient, but also fair and resilient. We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities. Evaluation and feedback from the company is also considered.},

	abstract = {Interim payment provisions in construction projects are susceptible to unfair practices. In construction project participants with varying financial capacities belonging to different organizations are bound by contractual relationships. Due to this type of project organizational structure, project participants do not completely trust each other which prevents the adoption of existing centralized automated frameworks for interim payment. Therefore, this paper presents a distributed blockchain-based framework that does not require to be trusted for automatically enforcing the terms and conditions related to interim payments and sharing payment records at project-level transparently and securely. A logic to automatically initiate, validate, and disburse interim payments according to general contract conditions for interim payments is formalized in this paper. A blockchain-based data model that enables selective-transparency in payment records is proposed. This data model facilitates the sharing of sensitive financial information privately between two contracting parties and non-sensitive payment-related information publicly among all project participants. The proposed blockchain-based framework is supported by a key management strategy to facilitate different security properties such as confidentiality and authenticity of data and users. Considering the non-technical nature of construction project participants, the proposed key management strategy is designed to dynamically generate cryptographic keys from publicly sharable parameters so that storage and management overheads are reduced. Security properties such as immutability, data confidentiality, user integrity, performance, and cost of deployment of the proposed blockchain framework are validated and recommendations for executing the proposed framework with a high level of security are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Millions of smart contracts have been deployed onto the Ethereum platform, posing potential attack subjects. Therefore, analyzing contract binaries is vital since their sources are unavailable, involving identification comprising function entry identification and detecting its boundaries. Such boundaries are critical to many smart contract applications, e.g. reverse engineering and profiling. Unfortunately, it is challenging to identify functions from these stripped contract binaries due to the lack of internal function call statements and the compiler-inducing instruction reshuffling. Recently, several existing works excessively relied on a set of handcrafted heuristic rules which impose several faults. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural network-based framework for EVM bytecode Function Entries and Boundaries Identification (neural-FEBI) that does not rely on a fixed set of handcrafted rules. Instead, it used a two-level bi-Long Short-Term Memory network and a Conditional Random Field network to locate the function entries. The suggested framework also devises a control flow traversal algorithm to determine the code segments reachable from the function entry as its boundary. Several experiments on 38,996 publicly available smart contracts collected as binary demonstrate that neural-FEBI confirms the lowest and highest F1-scores for the function entries identification task across different datasets of 88.3 to 99.7, respectively. Its performance on the function boundary identification task is also increased from 79.4\% to 97.1\% compared with state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate that the identified function information can be used to construct more accurate intra-procedural CFGs and call graphs. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, often based on handcrafted heuristic rules.},
